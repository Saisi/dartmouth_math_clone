<h2> Written Homework Assignment List</h2>

<p>In general, homework should be turned in either in class or by 5pm the day the homework is due (usually Monday), at my office.  Solutions will be posted a few days after each homework assignment is due.  There is no guarantee that the solutions are free of typos, though hopefully they are free of mathematical errors!
</p>

<p>
If you don't have it already, get <a href = "http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/">Python 2.7.2</a>.  
You should do this as early as possible and make sure it is working.  If you have trouble installing Python on your
own computer, you can ask for assistance, and we'll do our best to help you.  (You probably don't want to build from
source.  If you have a Windows machine, get the Windows MSI installer.  If you have Mac OS X, use the Mac installer.  
And if you use Linux, you can get Python through your Linux package manager.)

<h2> <a id = "submit">Program submission guidelines</a> </h2>

<p>
In general, each programming assignment will have two different types of components:
an actual programming component, and then a written component with an algorithmic emphasis.
The written component will be handed in just like a typical written homework assignment,
either in class or at my office.  
</p>

<p>
The program component will be submitted through a department <a href ="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m25f11/dropbox/index.phtml">homework
dropbox</a> page.  When you have completed your file (individual instructions for what should
be in your file will be given on each homework assignment) containing your functions and
programs, you will upload that file using this page.  Your will name your submission
"[lastname, in lowercase][# of assignment].py" - it is important that you use this 
format because the automated grader will assume that your file name has this format!
For example, my last name is Yang, so if I were submitting assignment 1, I would submit
the file "yang1.py".  In case we have multiple students with the same last name, we will
work out some sort of alternate file naming scheme.  (Uploading files pretending
to be another student is a violation of the honor code, and yes, if necessary, we can trace these
sorts of things.)  
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the uploader will only let you submit a file with a given name once, so you 
should be sure that the file you submit is the final version you want to send.  
</p>
