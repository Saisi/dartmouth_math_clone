<A name=topic1><B>The three sections of the course behave as one:</B></A> That is, all of the required work is the same, as is the material that is covered. The grades are assigned as if all students were attending the same class. So, you should feel free to talk to any of us, even though you probably should seek out your own instructor first, primarily because we want to get to know as many of you as possible.</P>

<P>
<A name=topic2><B>Textbook:</B></A> The manuscript <I>Principles of Calculus Modeling: An Interactive Approach</I>, by Donald Kreider, Dwight Lahr, and Susan Diesel, is available at <A HREF="http://www.wheelockbooks.com/"> Wheelock Books </A>. Each section of the book has a companion page on the Web which can be accessed at the KLDbook site (see left sidebar).

<P>
<A name=topic5><B>Class Meetings:</B></A> Class meetings consist of three 65-minute lectures. Normally, we will not meet in the x-hours; however, you must keep the time slots open because they may occasionally be used. The lectures introduce new material and provide the course structure.

<P>
<A name=topic15><B>Math3-to-Math1 Quiz:</B></A> We would like to identify all students for whom Math1 might be a better beginning calculus course. On Wednesday 9/28 after the first three Math3 classes, we will administer a quiz to help you decide. If by then you feel that the pace of Math3 is too fast, or the homework is too demanding or time consuming, you should consider moving to Math1: that course includes an in-depth review of precalculus topics, and together with Math2 covers intro calculus in two terms (Math1 + Math2 = Math3). This will be the last opportinity this term to make the change. The quiz, though the score will not count toward the course grade, must be taken by all Math 3 students. We want to be sure that you are in the calculus course that is right for you.

<P>
<A name=topic6><B>Examinations:</B></A> In addition to the Math3-to-Math1 Quiz, there will be two hour-exams and a (three-hour) final examination. The final exam has been scheduled by the Registrar's office for Saturday, December 3 at 11:30am. Don't make any travel plans that might conflict with this time because all Math 3 students must be there. Here is the schedule of the quiz, the two hour-exams and final:

<P>
The Math3-to-Math1 Quiz will be entirely multiple-choice. Each of the two hour-exams will consist of two parts—-a multiple-choice part and a non multiple-choice part where partial credit can be earned. The final exam will be entirely multiple-choice. No calculators, computers, or other electronic devices will be needed or allowed in these sit-down exams. Be sure to take #2 pencils to mark the scantron forms.

<P>
<A name=topic7><B>Daily Homework Problem Sets:</B></A> You will get and turn in <u>all</u> Math 3 homework over the World Wide Web using WeBWorK (see left sidebar for login). Homework due-dates will be shown on the WeBWorK assignments, which will generally be due at 8:00 a.m. on the second class day after the class in which the material is covered. Answers will be available at 1:00 p.m. on the same day. Late homework will not be accepted without advance permission from your
instructor, obtained well before the assignment is due. There will normally be at least one class-day between the day homework is assigned and the day it is due, thereby providing plenty of opportunity for you to get your questions answered. 

<!--
<P>
<A name=topic8><B>Case Study in Calculus Assignments:</B></A> This term we are going to develop four extended applications of calculus. They will be done in the form of what we will call a <I>Case Study in Calculus</I> (CSC). The CSC will be an example of using calculus to model real-world problems involving real data. They are nothing more than extended homework problems in WeBWorK. [They will not involve written reports. Note that this is a departure from what the textbook states.]
-->

<P>
<A name=topic11><B>Tutorials:</B></A> Assistance on the daily homework can be obtained in tutorials staffed by graduate Course Assistants and undergraduate student tutors. All tutorials are scheduled from 7:00 to 9:00 pm on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings and are held in a room 008 Kemeny. They begin Thursday September 22.


<P>
<A name=topic9><B>Academic Honor Principle:</B></A> On the two hour-exams and the final examination you will work individually, guided by the Dartmouth Academic Honor Principle. On the daily homework exercises, you will each have different numbers and you will turn in assignments individually, although you are encouraged to work collaboratively. Collaboration though does not include copying someone else's work——a clear violation of the Honor Principle. Feel free to talk with other students about the material. You may even decide to form a study group for that purpose. You also may seek assistance from a tutor or your instructor(s). When it comes to writing up the homework, however, you should do this by yourself without outside assistance. In this regard, it is a violation of the Honor Principle to share electronic files, or to type answers into someone else's WeBWorK account.

<P>
<A name=topic10><B>Grades:</B></A> The course grade will be based upon the scores of the two hour-exams, the final examination, and the homework, as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Math3-to-Math1 Quiz: diagnostic only. Does not count toward grade.<BR>
Hour-Exams: 200 points (100 points each)<BR>
Final Exam: 150 points (multiple-choice)<BR>
Homework: 50 points </BLOCKQUOTE>
The total of 400 points will be the basis for final grades in the course.

<P>
<A name=topic14><B>Students' Religious Observances:</B></A> Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term.  If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with your instructor before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.

<P>
<A name=topic12><B>Disabilities:</B></A> We encourage students with documented disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities such as chronic diseases, learning disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities, to discuss possible accommodations with one of your instructors. Students might want to consult as well Student Accessibility Services, 301 Collis Center, ext. 6-2014. In addition to providing information and services, the office can assist with determining appropriate accomodations and registering them.

<P>
<A name=topic14><B>Flu or Other Serious Illness:</B></A> If you contract a flu or other serious illness, please contact your professor by email.  We will be happy to make arrangements for you to make up late work, or exams if you provide us with a note from Dick's house.  Please do not come to class if you have an influenza-like illness. The Math 3 website contains the complete class schedule, so you will know what you've missed and how to keep up.  For more information on what to do if you believe you have the flu, see the <A HREF="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~prepare/common_hazards/influenza_and_illness.html">Dartmouth web page </A>devoted to this topic.  


<P>
<A name=topic13><B>Math 3 Website:</B></A> We have set up a website to organize the materials of the course. The address is <A HREF="index.html">http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m3f11/</A>.

<P>
Have a good term. We look forward to working with you.</P>
