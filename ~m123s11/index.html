Description</span>:
This course is meant to be a gentle introduction to the theory of
operator algebras.&nbsp; We will start with a review of spectral
theory
followed by the basics of C*-theory.&nbsp; After that, the content
will depend
on the participant's interests. &nbsp;(For a more formal course
announcement, click <a href="m123-ann.pdf">here</a>.)
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Text</span>: It is
not necessary to buy a text for this course. &nbsp;We will losely
follow Gerard Murhy's <span style="font-style: italic;">C*-algebras
and Operator Theory</span><span style="font-style: italic;">,
</span>and
this is a useful text to own if you are interested in the subject.
&nbsp;We will try to keep a copy of this text and other references
(mentioned in the course description document linked above) in the
graduate lounge in Kemeny Hall for <span style="font-style: italic;">everyone</span>
in the course to use. &nbsp;You may also find sections
&sect;&sect;2-4 of my <a href="ln-spec-thm.pdf">notes
on spectral theory</a> useful.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lecture Notes</span>:&nbsp; I've
started LaTeXing my <a href="cstar.pdf">lecture notes</a>.&nbsp;
Although this file may change almost daily, I'll make a link here for
folks who want to have a look.&nbsp; I most definitely recommend taking
your own notes in class and using these for comparision.&nbsp; Everyone
in class can have access to some sort of final version this summer.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Work load</span>:
Please come see me
(305 Kemeny Hall) if you are uncertain about taking the course --
either due to your prepraration or the work load associated to the
course.<br>

Homework: <br>
<ol>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>Assignment zero: please send me an email with the following
information:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Tell me about your analysis background.&nbsp; For example, who
did you take Math 113 from?</li>
    <li>Have you used or seen nets before?&nbsp; If so, how comfortable
are you with the concept?</li>
    <li>What do you hope to get out of the course?</li>
  </ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Assignment one</span>: <a
 href="hw1.pdf">Due Friday, April 8th</a>.&nbsp;
I have divided the homework into parts.&nbsp; Part I consists of (what
I hope are) very routine problems.&nbsp; Typically, these are unproved
assertions from lecture.&nbsp; Part II consists of honest homework
problems that are (I think) interesting in their own right.&nbsp; Part
III consists of harder problems that are either a topic or deeper part
of the theory that we didn't have time to cover in lecture.&nbsp; I
hope to continue this classification throughout the term.</li>
  <li>Some <a href="hw1-solns.pdf">partial solutions</a> to assignment
one.&nbsp; I am always interested in finding typos and thinkos, so
please feel free to comment.&nbsp; Here is the <a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m123s11/hw1.tex">LaTeX
source</a> for those who want it.&nbsp; You'll need the <a
 href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m123s11/dpwexam-new.cls">macros</a> below to LaTeX it.<br>

  <li>Optional Problems on nets: <a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m123s11/hw-nets.pdf">chick here</a>.&nbsp;
