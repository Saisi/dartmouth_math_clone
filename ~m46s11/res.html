<h4>Theory</h4>
<ul>

<li>Your main resource will be practising solving as many problems
as you can. This includes the old practise exams which are on the
<a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/sched.html">Schedule</a> page.

<li><a href="errata_logan.html">ERRATA</a> for our textbook,
Logan's <i>Applied Mathematics</i>, 3rd Edition (2006).

<li>At the library:
<ul>
<li>J. David Logan, <i>Applied Partial Differential Equations</i> (2004).
This nice book
goes into more detail than chapter 6 of our book, at a slightly more leisurely
pace. I nearly chose this book as our text, but preferred a more
broad coverage of applied math.

<li>F. B. Hildebrand, <i>Methods of Applied Mathematics, 2nd edition</i>
(1965). Although old-looking, Chapter 3 on integral equations is a very clear
coverage of the same material we'll do from Logan.

<li>Bender &amp; Orszag, ``Advanced Mathematical Methods for
Scientists and Engineers'' (1999). This is the bible on asymptotics
and boundary layers, and is graduate-level.
</ul>

<li>Daw's nice 13-page lecture notes on <a href="http://hubcap.clemson.edu/~daw/D_PHYS845/DimensionalAnalysisLecture.pdf">dimensional analysis</a>.

<li><a href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~bruce/courses/math538.html">
Course</a> with lecture notes, homeworks, using <i>our textbook</i>,
at U. Alberta, Canada.
Another <a href="http://www.math.montana.edu/~vogel/Courses/M450_2003/M450.html">course</a> using our book (2nd Ed.) at Montana, with HW and exams.

<li><a href="http://www.mathphysics.com/pde/index.html">Linear methods in
applied mathematics</a> by Harrell and Herod, from Georgia Tech,
covers most of our course,
esp. Ch.4 and 6, including much more material.

<li><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Mathematics/18-303Fall-2006/CourseHome/index.htm">Linear PDEs</a> course from MIT, with lecture notes and HW.
<a href="http://www.math.gatech.edu/~herod/4348/4348.html">Math 4348</a>
course with lecture notes on integral equations, PDEs and Greens functions,
from Georgia Tech.

<li><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Mathematics/18-311Spring-2006/CourseHome/index.htm">Principles of Applied Mathematics</a> course at MIT,
just HW and exams.
Also <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Nuclear-Engineering/22-00JSpring-2006/CourseHome/index.htm">Introduction to Modeling and Simulation</a>,
has lecture notes and HW.

<li> General notes on <a href="../~ahb/linalg/exam_technique.pdf">exam and study
technique</a> (geared mainly towards final exams in intermediate-level math courses).

</ul>


<h4>Tools</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Java applet versions of
<a href="http://math.rice.edu/~dfield/dfpp.html">dfield and pplane</a>
that let you numerically explore 1-variable and 2-variable ODEs.

<li> my Matlab demo of 2nd-order singularly-perturbed 2-point BVPs,
showing boundary layer behavior: <a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m46s11/bdrylayerdemo.m"><code>bdrylayerdemo.m</code></a>

<li> Matlab demo of relative accuracy of WKB approximations to
eigenvalues converging as O(1/n<sup>2</sup>): <a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m46s11/wkb_acc.m"><code>wkb_acc.m</code></a> and <a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m46s11/shooting.m"><code>shooting.m</code></a> (it would be probably better to recode this using <code>bvp4c</code>; somebudy have a try...)

<li> <a href="http://www.math.uic.edu/~jan/mcs320s07/">MAPLE</a> tutorials;
MAPLE is useful for symbolic calculation and is free to use on campus,
download <a href="http://caligari.dartmouth.edu/downloads/maple">here</a>.

</ul>


<a name="mat"></a>
<h4><a href="http://www.mathworks.com">MATLAB</a></h4>
<ul>
<li> Download the software from

<a href="http://caligari.dartmouth.edu/downloads/matlab">Dartmouth</a>
(or 
<a href="http://hydra.dartmouth.edu/matlab/downloads">here</a>);
we have 100 or so on-campus licenses.
<li> <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~sas/">Susan A. Schwarz</a>
(<a href="mailto:Susan.A.Schwarz@Dartmouth.EDU">email</a> her if you have
Mac OS 10.2 or earlier for install CDs) can help with
installation issues.

<li>Matlab is installed on the two public iMacs in the Kemeny 
undergraduate lounge (it might be a bit slow there). To print out you'd 
need to save as PostScript to a memory stick and print elsewhere, or 
email to yourself, etc.
