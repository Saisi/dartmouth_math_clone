Mathematics is being increasingly applied throughout the physical,
biological and social sciences ...the skill to do this successfully is
highly sought after!
This course provides essential analytical ("pencil-paper-brain") 
tools for
mathematical modeling of the real world, and solving (or approximately
solving) the resulting equations.

<p>
We start with dimensional analysis and scaling, which allows you to say
a surprising amount without solving any equations at all!
Most of the time the equations arising in nature are <i>differential equations</i>.
With ODEs we explore <i>perturbation</i> methods, that is,
asking how a solution changes if the equation changes slightly from a
known case; this allows scientists to understand approximate
solutions <i>before</i> they sit down at a computer.
The "opposite" of an ODE is an <i>integral equation</i>,
which introduces us to <i>operators</i>, key objects in any 
math toolbox (melding calculus and linear algebra).
An application will be de-blurring of (1D) images.
For PDEs we will cover examples
that are <i>linear</i> (such as heat flow and waves, building on Math 23)
and maybe <i>non-linear</i>
(such as reaction-diffusion equations for bacterial growth).
To analyse linear PDE we learn tools such as Greens functions and
the Fourier transform.
We might get to water waves
(linear dispersive PDE) or shock waves in traffic flow (a nonlinear 
PDE).
There's also a little numerical plotting (eg Matlab or whatever you 
prefer), but numerical methods are not a focus of the course.

<p><b>Lectures / OH</b>: Kemeny 108, MWF 1:45-2:50pm (period 2),
important to attend since we'll do lots of worksheets together.
I strongly recommend you read the material in the book <i>in advance</i> of
the lecture.
X-hour is 1-1:50pm Thurs, and I will use intermittently for:
Matlab sessions, review, problem-solving sessions, catch-up lectures, etc.
Do not schedule anything regular in this X-hr; I expect to use about half of them.
I encourage you to come to office hours:
<b>Mon 3-4pm, Tue 1:30-2:30pm, and Fri 3-4pm</b>.

<p><b>Required book</b>: <i>Applied Mathematics</i>, Third Edition by
 J. David Logan (Published by Wiley Interscience, New York, 2006).
 This otherwise excellent book has a moderate list of <a
 href="errata_logan.html">errata</a> which I suggest you copy in to
 save later confusion. Available at <a
 href="wheelock.html">Wheelock Books</a>, etc.

<p><b>Homework</b>: 9 weekly HW's due Wednesday at start of lecture.
I strongly suggest you <i>collaborate</i>, and
try at least some of the
relevant homework problems <i>before the next lecture</i>
(leaving it all for Tuesday night
risks you getting left behind in this fast-paced course.)
Please make your working/reasoning as clear as you can, write clearly,
don't be scared of using lots of space on the page, and staple your work.
<font color="red">Late homework will not be accepted</font>
(unless by prior arrangement for a valid, and <i>exceptional</i>, 
reason).
Your lowest HW score will be dropped, ie you get a `free' HW.

<p><b>Exams</b>: I will try to give you ample time to complete exam
questions. However, the only key is to practise, practise, practise.
(Also read <a href="../~ahb/linalg/exam_technique.pdf">this</a>).

<ul>
<li>
<i>Midterm 1</i>: <font color=red>Thursday, April 28, 6-8pm, Carson 60</font>.
<li>
<i>Midterm 2</i>: <font color=red>Thursday, May 19, 6-8pm, Carson 60</font>.
<li>
<i>Final</i>: <font color=red>Friday June 3, 3-6pm, Kemeny 007</font>.
Note this cannot be given early to match travel plans - sorry!
</ul>

<p><b> Honor principle</b>. Exams: no help given or received. Homework:
group discussion and
collaboration on problem techniques is great and helpful.
Write-ups must be done individually (<i>ie no copying</i>).

<p><b> Grades</b>:
Will be based on HW 30%, Midterms 2*20%, Final 30%.
Note the HW is quite heavily weighted, and is
the main chance you get to practise
and get feedback, so stay on top of it.
Grades in Math 46 are not curved; other students' good performance
will not hurt your grade. (So please work together and help each other out!)

<p><b>Special needs</b>: I encourage students with disabilities,
including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases and learning
disabilities, to discuss with us any appropriate accommodations that
might be helpful.  Let me know asap, certainly in first 2 weeks.  Also
stop by the Academic Skills Center in 301 Collis to register for
support services.

<p><b>Private tutoring</b>: Tutor Clearinghouse <i>may</i> have private
one-on-one tutors available for Math 46 (although this is rare in advanced courses, so come and talk to me if you feel lost and no tutors are available).
If a student receives financial aid, the
College will pay for three hours of tutoring per week. If you would
like to have a tutor, please go to 301 Collis and apply as early as possible.

<p><b>Religious observance</b>:
Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term.  If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.
