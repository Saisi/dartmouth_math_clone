<ul>
<li> <b>SECOND EXAM:</b> The second exam has now been graded, and if you signed the waiver on the front of your exam, it has been returned to the homework boxes.</li>
<li>The results were much better than last time.  GOOD WORK!  Please
have a look at the solutions posted below.
</li><ul>
  <li>Here are some <a href="exam2-solns.pdf">solutions</a>.</li>
  <li>Here is a <a href="exam2-hist.pdf">hist-o-gram</a> of the scores
  on the second exam.</li>
  <li>We can still only give a crude estimate of your grade in the
  course to date.  Of course, this does not include your WeBWorK or
  written homework grades.  Nor does it reflect whether your work is
  improving or getting worse.  The scales below are based on the total
  of your first two exams (out of 200).</li>
<ul>
  <li>Some sort of A: a total of 150 or more.</li>
  <li>Some sort of B: a total of 119 or more.</li>
  <li>Some sort of C: a total of 94 or more.</li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
  <li> FIRST EXAM: If you signed the waiver on the front of your exam, you can now
  pick up your exam from the homework boxes.  Otherwise, you can pick
  up your exam from your instructor after lecture on Wednesday. <b>Everyone</b> is advised to look over the exam solutions posted below.</li>
   <ul>
    <li> The exam proved to be more difficult that we expected.
    Nevertheless, the overall class performace was good.  It is
    probably too early to be thinking seriously about grades, but the
    follow crude guidelines may help in interpreting your performance.
    Please be advised that not only are these guidelines crude (in
    particular, there are no "pluses" or "minuses"), but they do not
    reflect WeBWorK or the written assignments. </li>
      <ul>
      <li>A: 73 and above</li>
      <li>B: 49 and above</li>
      <li>C: 35 and above</li>
    </ul>
   <li>Here is a link to some <a href="exam1-solns.pdf">solutions</a> for
    the exam.</li>
   <li>Here is a link to a <a href="exam1-hist.pdf">hist-o-gram</a> of
   scores another other data for the exam</li>
  </ul>
