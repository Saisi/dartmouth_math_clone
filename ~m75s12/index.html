<br>This course explores the relationship of number theory to graph
theory. &nbsp;The study of the integers mod N and the study of finite
graphs both involve many of the same tools and ask parallel sorts of
questions. &nbsp;Often one area of study informs the other. &nbsp;In
this course you will exercise your algebra and your linear algebra, and
review your Fourier analysis (or learn it for the first time).
&nbsp;Some of the basic ideas of Math 25 will appear here but it is not
necessary to have taken that course first. &nbsp;This topic is a good
source of open questions, research projects, and applications in
various corners of applied math. &nbsp;<span style="font-weight:

<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br><span style="font-weight:
bold;">Grading:</span>
Grades will be based on homework (presented in class) and a project.
&nbsp;Undergraduates will submit a paper about their project at the end
of the course. &nbsp;Graduate students may opt to do an oral
presentation instead. &nbsp;The format of the class will be as a
seminar. &nbsp;Everyone will have a chance to present material.<br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Attendance:</span>
This
quarter we meet MWF 11:15-12:20 and T 12-1. &nbsp;I expect to use the
x-hour most weeks in addition to or in place of the Friday class
meeting. &nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Text</span>:&nbsp;We
will be using Fourier Analysis on Finite Groups and Applications, by
Terras. &nbsp;Terras is noted for her problem sets, which complete the
gaps in the text, fill in background information, and are occasionally
sneaky open questions. &nbsp;Professor Wallace knows a lot of number
theory and some graph theory,
but she doesn't know everything in this book. &nbsp;We will be learning
new
things together.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Office hours:</span> Wallace's office:
Kemeny 204. &nbsp;Office hours: M 1-2, W 2-3, Th 12-2 and by
appointment. &nbsp;Note that I am also teaching Math 4/27 this term,
and these hours are for both classes. &nbsp;If you have a long
question, I suggest making an appointment.<br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Honor principle: </span>All authors must personally write any paper
with their name on it. &nbsp;All sources must be appropriately cited.
&nbsp;Any suspicion of plagiarism will be forwarded to the
COS.<br><p><b>Religious observance</b>: Some students may wish to take part
in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you
have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in
the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of
the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.
