<p><i>Music and math have gone hand in hand for thousands of years. Come and
explore the myriad mathematical connections underlying the workings of
musical instruments, the human voice, hearing, acoustics, sound analysis,
musical composition, and more.</i>

<p>
Sound and music are integral parts of all cultures and are critical to
human and animal communications.  The production,
transmission, and perception of sound is woven through with
mathematics. With the goal of expanding both scientific and artistic horizons
(and teaching you some ear-opening practical skills)
we explore vibration, resonance, waves, musical
instruments, the human ear, speech, architectural acoustics, harmony
and dissonance, tuning systems, and composition.
<p>
Prerequisites: high-school algebra, trigonometry, and some physics.
Familiarity with musical notation or some instrument will help.

<p><b>Lectures / OH</b>: Kemeny 201, MWF 10:00-11:05am (period "10"),
important to attend since we'll do lots of demonstrations and group
worksheets. X-hour
is 12:00-12:50pm Thurs, and I will use several of them for:
hands-on computer sessions, quizzes, catch-up lectures, review, etc.
Do not schedule anything regular in this X-hr.
I encourage you to come to office hours, Monday 2-3pm, Tuesday 4-6pm.
Also tutoring 6-8pm Tues, Kemeny 201; see below.

<p><b>Book(s)</b>: There are no required books, since most students find the lecture materials a good start. However, if you want a reasonably-priced relevant book I suggest: <i><a href="http://www.musimathics.com">
Musimathics</a>, Volume 1</i>, by Gareth Loy
(Published by MIT Press, reprinted and corrected edition, 2008).
If you accidentally get the 2006 edition, you'll need 
the <a 
href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m5s07/errata_loy.html">errata</a>.
This will be on reserve at Baker-Berry library;
also see <a href="res.html">Resources</a> for other useful books.


<p><b>Homework</b>: 8 weekly HW's due each Wednesday at start of lecture.
I strongly encourage you to <i>collaborate</i>, and to
try at least some of the
relevant homework problems <i>before the next lecture</i>
(leaving it all for Tuesday night
risks you getting left behind in this fast-paced course.)
Please make your working/reasoning as clear as you can, write clearly,
don't be scared of using lots of space on the page, and staple your work.
<font color="red">Late homework will not be accepted</font>
(unless by prior arrangement for a valid, and exceptional, reason).
Your lowest HW score will be dropped.

<p><b>Exams/Quizzes</b>:
There will be a couple of 20-minute in-class quizzes, 1 midterm, and 1 final.
These will test both mathematical and conceptual understanding,
and problem-solving.
I will try to give you ample time to complete exam
questions. However, the only key is to practise, practise, practise!
<ul>
<li>
<i>Midterm</i>: Thursday Oct 20, 6-8pm, Kemeny 201.
<li>
<i>Final</i>: Monday Dec 5, 8am, <font color=red>Kemeny 108</font>
<br>
Note this will <i>not</i> be given early to accommodate travel plans.
</ul>

<p><b>Project work</b>: Project work (the last 2 weeks)
is an important and fun part of this
course (see <a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m5f11/projects.txt">info</a>.) Examples:
instrument or room acoustic analysis,
inventing and building a new instrument, essay on history of music
technology or composition, testing the human ear.
It includes a brief presentation to the rest of class.
You may work in groups up to 2 (since it's a small class this year).
There will be a presentation day (which the last class really 
enjoyed doing) on
<ul>
<li><font color=red>Wednesday Nov 30th, in class.</font>.
</ul>
Write-ups are short, and due Tues Dec 6, 5pm, in my office (recommend
you finish earlier than that).

<p><b>Aural postings</b>:
I want you to post interesting sounds,
discuss real-world examples relevant to our course,
articles, links, pictures, etc.
on the <a href="comments/index.html">Aural Postings</a> page each week.
This is a way for you to share phenomena/ideas/sounds you discover.
We will discuss them each Monday.

<p><b>Grades</b>:
Will be based on roughly, HW 20%, Quizzes 10%,
Midterm 20%, Project &amp; Aural postings 20%, Final exam 30%.
Note the HW is not heavily weighted but is
<i>the</i> main chance you get to practise solving problems
and get feedback, so stay on top of it.
Grades in Math 5 are not curved; other students' good performance
will not hurt your grade. (So please work together and help each other out!)

<p><b>Tutoring</b>: 
We will have Shirine Sajjadi '11 be our course tutor, offering a weekly
session 6-8pm Tues, in Kemeny 206. Priority will be given for reviewing math
(algebra, trig, graphs, etc) rather than HW questions.
<p>
Private tutoring through the College is also possible
(you'll want to find a student who took M5 before or knows enough
music/math/engineering or physics, etc to help).
If a student receives financial aid, the
College will pay for three hours of tutoring per week. If you would
like to have such a tutor, please go to 301 Collis and apply as early as possible.
For more information check <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/tutors/index.html">here</a>

<p><b>Honor principle</b>. Exams: no help given or received. Homework:
group discussion and collaboration on HW is great and helpful.
However, write-ups must be done individually (<i>ie no copying</i>).

<p><b>Special needs</b>: I encourage students with disabilities,
including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases and learning
disabilities, to discuss with us any appropriate accommodations that
might be helpful.  Let me know asap, certainly in first 2 weeks.  Also
stop by the Academic Skills Center in 301 Collis to register for
support services.

<p><b>Religious observance</b>:
Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term.  If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.
