<h3>Theory: General references</h3>
<ul>

<li>On <b>reserve</b> at Baker library (the Paddock ones have been moved
to Baker):
<ul>
<li>Gareth Loy, <i>Musimathics, volume 1</i>.
My list of <a href="errata_loy.html">ERRATA</a> for first
printing (2006) of this book.
The second printing
I have been promised corrects more of these.
Author's <a href="http://www.musimathics.com">website</a>.

<li>Arthur Benade, <i>Fundamentals of Musical Acoustics</i>,
(Dover edition, 1990), is a beautiful, non-mathematical introduction
at about our level (in fact with less math than we'll do).
Benade was a renowned researcher of the workings of instruments.

<li>Rossing, Moore and Wheeler, <i>The Science of Sound</i>,
3rd Ed. (2002). (I think 2nd Ed. is also on reserve).
This massive book introduces many of the
concepts of our course, at our level, with a engineering/physics rather
than math spin.
It tends to be encyclopedic, with a lot of sometimes tedious or
incomprehensible data and graphs on particular instruments,
while missing the elegant universal themes.

<li> Fauvel, J.,   Flood,  R., and  Wilson, R., eds.
<i>Music and Mathematics : from Pythagoras to fractals</i> (2003).
Lovely collection of (unrelated) articles connecting music and math.
Great source of project ideas, esp. for those who prefer historical
and music analysis projects.

<li>Charles Taylor, <i>Exploring Music: The Science and Technology
of Tones and Tunes</i> (1992). Very intuitive, has lots of engineering type
demos, pictures of waves, etc. Not mathematical.

<li>Johnston, I. H.,
<i>Measured tones : the interplay of physics and music</i> (2002).
As with the above, a nice, intuitive book with concepts explained via text rather than equations. Good explanations of tuning systems, pipe and string modes. 
</ul>

<li><a href="http://www.maths.abdn.ac.uk/~bensondj/html/maths-music.html">
<i>Music: A Mathematical Offering</i></a>
by David J. Benson (Cambridge University Press, 2007),
a freely-available 10MB PDF file. This is a wonderful study,
with beautiful and deep musical-math connections,
and almost-obsessive detail about <i>e.g.</i>
tuning systems, Fourier methods, world-music instruments, symmetry, etc.
It is at the advanced undergrad math major level, but don't be scared to
dig in!

<li>Other books:
<ul>
<li>Fletcher, <i>The Physics of Musical Instruments</i> (1991),
wonderful investigations into details of instrument acoustics,
is more mathematically sophisticated than our course.
Fletcher is known for his original research in this area.
