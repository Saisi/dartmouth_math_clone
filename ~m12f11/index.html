<h2><a id = "Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>	

<p>
Math 12 is a calculus class intended for incoming first-year students who have
taken the equivalent of Calculus BC and scored a 5 on the AP exam.  We cover 
the standard curriculum of multivariable calculus; doing this in a trimester 
versus the usual semester at most universities means the pace of this class will be rather quick.
</p>

<p>
Math 11 and math 12 more or less cover the same material, but as math 12 is intended
for students who would like more of a challenge, certain topics will be covered more
in-depth (for example, the intepretation of the derivative as a linear transformation)
and homework assignments may be more difficult.  All this being said, 
transferring between the two classes should not be too much of a problem.
</p>

<h2><a id = "Coordinates">Class Coordinates </a></h2> 

<p>
Room: Kemeny 007 </br>
Time: 1:45pm - 2:50pm, Monday, Wednesday, Friday </br>
X-hour: Thursday, 1:00pm - 1:50pm.  We may use the X-hour a few times for
mandatory classes (if we fall behind schedule or I need to reschedule a class), 
and some of the X-hour classes will be optional, like review sessions for exams
or talks about topics which are related but not essential parts of the course
curriculum.  </p>

<p>Tutorial room: 312 Silsby </br> 
Tutorial times: 7:00pm - 9:00pm, Thursday, Sunday </br>
TA: Sarah Wolff </br>

Name: Andrew Yang <br>
Office: Kemeny 316 <br>
Office Hours: Tuesday 2:30pm - 4:00pm, Thursday 1:00pm - 2:20pm.</p>

<h2><a id = "Exams">Examination Schedule </a></h2>

<p> There will be two midterms and a final exam.  All exams are closed book
and no calculators or computational assistants of any kind.  
  <ul>
    <li> Midterm 1: Tuesday, October 18 2011, 5:00pm - 7:00pm, Rockefeller 001</li>
    <li> Midterm 2: Tuesday, November 15 2011, 5:00pm - 7:00pm, Rockefeller 001</li>
    <li> Final exam: December 4, 3pm-6pm, Kemeny 007. </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p> If you are unable to be at any of these exams, please contact me as soon as possible so we can setup alternate test-taking arrangements. </p>


<h2><a id = "Grading">Grading</a></h2>

 <p>
Your grade in this class will be determined by homework and exams.
</p>

<p>  There will be two types of homework assignments: Webwork and written assignments.  Webwork is 
an automated computer-based grading system where you get slightly randomized problems, and 
try to solve them until the computer tells you your answer is correct.  We will generally use
Webwork for easier questions which are more suited for computer automated grading.  These
will usually be given out three times a week, and shouldn't take too long to complete (not much
more than 60 to 90 minutes, say.)  
</p>

<p>
Written assignments will consist of questions which will usually be more difficult than 
Webwork assignments.  You will need to write down solutions which justify your answers and
turn them in.  
</p>

<p>
There will be two midterm exams and a final examination.  All exams will be at a specified
location and will be closed book.
</p> 


<p> 
Each of the above contributes to your final grade in the following fashion:
<ul>
    <li> Homework, Webwork: 15% </li>
    <li> Homework, Written: 15% </li>
    <li> Midterms: 20% each (40% total) </li>
    <li> Final exam: 30% </li>
</ul>

Your final letter grade is computed using a curve.  Exactly what the distribution of letter grades cannot be 
determined in advance, although it should not stray too far from the way grades were distributed
in previous terms.  
</p>

<h2><a id="Homework">Homework Policy</a></h2> 
<p>
Written homework assignments will be posted on this website and will be usually due about a week after they are posted.  Late assignments will only be accepted when granted an extension, which must be requested from the instructor several days in advance.  In general, extensions will only be granted for health-related reasons or family emergencies.  Exceptions may be made for school-related travel. </p>

<p>
The homework collaboration policy for this class is more or less in line with other Dartmouth math classes.  You are allowed to collaborate with others on homework, but must write your own solutions.  A good rule of thumb is that you should never be copying phrases or sentences from anyone else or any source.  You may use theorems, lemmas, etc. that we have covered from the textbook, but in general you should not use theorems, lemmas, etc. from sections of the book we have not covered or from external sources.  Also, please write down the people you collaborated with and outside sources (namely, anything besides the required textbook) you consulted on your homework assignments.  
</p>

<h2><a id = "Textbook">Textbook</a></h2> 
 <p>
 The required book for this class is <em>Calculus</em>, 7th edition, by James Stewart, ISBN 978-0538497817. 
 </p>

<p> There are many books about calculus.  The following are a few books which might be worth consulting:</p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Div, grad, curl, and all that</em>, 4th Edition, by H.M. Schey, ISBN 978-0393925166. </br>

    This book takes a more informal and physics-inspired approach to the material in the second half of the class.  It is            well-written, contains many exercises, and is not particularly long, so this book might be a useful supplement to the main text.
</li>

<li> <em>Calculus, Volume II</em>, 2nd edition, by Tom Apostol, ISBN 978-0471000075. </br>

This book contains a lot of the material we will be covering in this class, in a slightly more abstract way.  This book also contains linear algebra, and so is able to present multivariable calculus in a more generalized and uniform setting.  
</li>

<li> <em>Calculus on Manifolds</em>, by Michael Spivak, ISBN 978-0805390216. </br>

This book is for more ambitious students, who are interested in understanding the material in the second half of the class in a more general context.  Students who intend to major in mathematics or theoretical physics will be the ones who find this book relevant.  If you choose to read this book you will probably need outside assistance to do so.
</li></ul>
</p>

<h2><a id = "Description">Course description</a></h2> 

<p>

Our primary goal in this class is to cover chapter 13 through 16 of the textbook.  We begin by 
quicking thinking about lines and planes in three dimensional space.  We then study differential calculus
of functions of several variables, which includes topics like vector-valued functions, partial derivatives, directional derivatives,
tangent planes, the second derivative test, and Lagrange multipliers.  After that we study integral
calculus of functions of several variables, which includes topics like multiple integration and coordinate changes.
Finally, we apply everything learned earlier to the study of line and surface integrals, and conclude
with the three great theorems of the subject, Green's Theorem, the Divergence Theorem, and Stokes' Theorem.
