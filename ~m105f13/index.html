<p>Our text is "Introduction to analytic number theory" by Tom M. Apostol,
published by Springer.  This book is at Wheelock Books.
It is available on amazon as well (today, 9/16/13, it is about $43
for the hardcover edition, but the price goes up and down).
</p>

<p> We meet MWF at 11:15, the room is 004 Kemeny.

Introduction to analytic number theory <br>
<br>
Analytic number theory uses tools from analysis, both real and
complex, to study the distribution of special numbers (such as
primes) within the integers and to study the distribution of
number-theoretic functions.  An early triumph in the field is
the theorem of Dirichlet that in any residue class a (mod b),
where a, b are relatively prime, there are infinitely many primes.
The text we'll be using is fairly gentle and is in fact in the
Springer series Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics.  Always
optimistic, I hope we can get through most of the book, with
more thoroughness in some areas than others.  Some of the highlights
will be Dirichlet's theorem mentioned above, Gauss sums (with
applications to the law of quadratic reciprocity and the Polya-Vinogradov
inequality), and the prime number theorem.
</p><p>

Prerequisites:  An undergrad number theory course, as well as some
abstract algebra.  I'll be happy to try and fill in gaps for motivated
students.
</p><p>

Grading:  There will be weekly written assignments, plus some class
presentations.  There will be no formal exams.  Enrolled graduate students
who have been admitted to candidacy will be excused from the written
assignments.

Sept. 26, Jim Brown, Clemson U.<br>
Oct. 31, Yitang Zhang, UNH<br>
Nov. 14, Adriana Salerno, Bates C.<br>
These three should also be giving number theory seminars.
The seminar will meet at 2:30 pm on Thursdays in 343 Kemeny,

<p>Assignment #1 (due at 11:15 am, Monday 9/23):<br>
<p>
(1) Let <i>S</i> be a countable set of positive real numbers such
that the number of members of <i>S</i> lying in (0,<i>x</i>]  is
<i>O</i>(<i>x</i>) for <i>x</i> starting at 2.  Show that the sum of reciprocals of members
of <i>S</i> lying in this interval is <i>O</i>(log <i>x</i>).
(Hint: Use partial summation, also called Abel summation.  This goes for
the next problem as well.  You would have to generalize the identity
in the notes and book somewhat.  There is another approach to
these two problems that's more elementary.  For example, if <i>a<sub>n</sub></i>
is the <i>n</i>-th term of the set, then the number of terms up to this
number is of course <i>n</i>, but the assumption in the problem says that
it is at most <i>ca<sub>n</sub></i>...)
<p>
(2) (Continuation) Now suppose that for <i>x</i> starting at 2, the number of
members of <i>S</i> in the interval is <i>O</i>(<i>x</i>/(log <i>x</i>)<sup>2</sup>). 
Show that the sum of the reciprocals of the members of <i>S</i> is
finite.
<p>
Do problems 15, 16, 17, 28, 30 in Chapter 1 of the text.
(Hints:  On number 28, note that in general, gcd(<i>a,b</i>)
=gcd(<i>a-b,b</i>).  On 30, here's a way <i>not</i> to do
the problem, but the neat way is somewhat similar:  Using
that there's a prime <i>p</i> larger than <i>n</i>/2 and 
less than or equal to <i>n</i>, we see that <i>p</i> must
divide the denominator of the harmonic sum to <i>n</i> when
reduced to lowest terms, so the harmonic sum cannot be an integer.  The
reason you should not use this proof is that we haven't
proved the deal about the existence of <i>p</i>.)
</p>

<p>Assignment #2 (due at 11:15 am, Monday 9/30):<br>
Do problems 2, 3, and 5 in Chapter 2, plus these
<a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/m105hw2.pdf">supplementary problems</a>.
(Note that one of these problems was edited on 9/26.)
</p>

<p>Assignment #3 (due at 11:15 am, Monday 10/7):<br>
Problem 12 in Chapter 2 (hint: are both functions
multiplicative?) <br>
Also, <a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/m105hw3.pdf">these problems</a>.
(Posted the evening of 10/1 and with a new problem on the morning of 10/2.)
</p>

<p>Assignment #4 (due at 11:15 am, Monday 10/14):<br>
Do <a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/m105hw4.pdf">these problems</a>.  (A small edit
was made on 10/9.)  
</p>

<p>Assignment #5 due Monday, October 21 at 11:15 AM:
Ch. 6, #14, 15, 17.  (In 17b it is to be assumed that <i>f</i> is
not identically 0.)
</p>

<p>Assignment #6 due Monday, Oct. 28, 2013 at 11:15 AM:  Do <a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/m105hw6.pdf">these problems</a>.
</p>

<p>Your assignment for Monday, Nov. 4 is to pick a topic for a class presentation,
tell me about it, and have either a meeting with me scheduled or the actual
presentation scheduled.  For students past quals, this is voluntary.

			<p style="text-align : justify"> Collaboration on
homework is definitely allowed and even encouraged.  However,
it is tempting to think that you understand something that was figured out
by your friend.  When you hand in a solution, you should know it well enough
that you could explain it to others.  Please name others you worked with
when handing in homework papers.              Merely copying (electronic or
			otherwise) of another person's solutions, in whole
			or in part, is a violation of the Honor Code,
even if attribution is made.  You should understand what you turn in.</p>
