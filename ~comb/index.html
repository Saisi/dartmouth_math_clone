<b>A statistic-preserving involution on lattice paths</b><br />
<br />
<b>Abstract:</b> Let T and B be two lattice paths with steps N=(0,1) and E=(0,1), from 
(0,0) to (a,b), with B not going above T. Let S(T,B) be the set of lattice 
paths with steps N and E from (0,0) to (a,b) that lie between T and B. For 
each path P in S(T,B), let
<p>
t(P) = number of E steps where P and T coincide,
<br>
b(P) = number of E steps where P and B coincide.
</p>
I will describe a bijection that proves that, for all i,j, the number of 
paths P in S(T,B) with t(P)=i and b(P)=j is the same as the number of 
those with t(P)=j and b(P)=i. This generalizes the fact that on Dyck 
paths, the statistics 'height of the last peak' and 'number of returns' 
have a symmetric joint distribution, which can be proved using generating 
functions or a (different) bijection due to Emeric Deutsch.

<b>Diagram algebras as combinatorial tools for exploring 
Kazhdan--Lusztig theory</b><br />
<br />
<b>Abstract:</b> 
Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials are subtle objects that arise 
naturally in the context of Hecke algebras associated to Coxeter 
groups.  Unfortunately, computing these polynomials efficiently quickly 
becomes difficult, even in finite groups of moderate size.  Computing 
the Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials would be simplified if one could easily 
obtain the leading coefficients.  In this talk, I will discuss how 
methods from the theory of diagram algebras can be used to 
combinatorially and non-recursively compute the leading coefficients of 
certain Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials.  In particular, we will focus our 
attention on Hecke algebras of types $A$, $B$, and affine $C$.  
Moreover, we will relay the current state of affairs of diagram algebras 
as combinatorial tools for exploring Kazhdan--Lusztig theory.

<b>A Graph Encoding a Partial Ordering on the Affine Symmetric Group</b><br />
<br />
<b>Abstract:</b>We will introduce several combinatorial models for the affine 
symmetric group, which is an infinite analog of the group of permutations.  
We then define an important partial ordering on this group, called the Bruhat order.  
Amazingly, the Bruhat order on this infinite group is encoded in a user-friendly 
format by paths in the quantum Bruhat graph, which is a weighted, directed graph 
whose vertices are the elements in the finite symmetric group.  Time permitting, 
we will discuss applications to quantum Schubert calculus and related open problems.

<b>ombinatorial aspects of the hypersimplex</b><br />
<br />
<b>Abstract:</b> Given a polytope, we can define its h-vector, where each term is nonnegative and 
their sum equals the normalized volume of the polytope. the normalized volume ofIt is well-known 
that the hypersimplex is the Eulerian number. Therefore its h-vector provides a refinement of the 
Eulerian number. We proved a conjecture by Stanley describing this refinement by descents and 
excedances by a shellable triangulation. We also generalized this result to slices of larger 
rectangles. As a byproduct, we came up with a new Eulerian statistic, which enjoys some nice equal 
joint-distributions with some other known permutation statistics. Combinatorial proofs of some of 
them are still open.

<b>Affine  Mirkovic-Vilonen polytopes</b><br />
<br />
<b>Abstract:</b> Kashiwara developed combinatorial objects called crystals to study the
representation theory of complex simple Lie groups and Lie algebras.
The construction is quite involved, but one can often realize the same
combinatorics by more elementary means. One useful realization is
based on the Mirkovic-Vilonen polytopes of the title. I will describe
what these polytopes are, and why they are interesting. I will then
explain current work giving an analogous construction for symmetric
affine Kac-Moody algebras. For affine sl(2) the construction is purely
combinatorial. For other symmetric affine types the definitions are
combinatorial, but we need some geometry (quiver varieties) to prove
that everything works. I will explain these ideas mainly via examples
and pictures, and will not assume familiarity with the representation
theory involved. This is joint work with Pierre Baumann, Thomas Dunlap
and Joel Kamnitzer.

<b>Type C symmetry in type A representation theory</b><br />
<br />
<b>Abstract:</b> We'll see how certain kinds of tensor spaces for Lie Algebras 
g=gl_n or sl_n carry type C symmetry, and how we can use that fact to build an 
action of the type C Weyl group on modules for the centralizer of g on tensor 
space of a specific form.
