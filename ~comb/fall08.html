<br><br>
Kemeny <b>120</b> and TIME: 11:00 AM
<br><br>
<b> Abstract: </b> With the recent application of Sperner's Lemma to the complexity of
finding market Nash Equilibria, we are motivated to further explore
Sperner's Triangle.  Taking a recreational path, we use this triangle to
create the board game Atropos.  In this talk, we will describe many nice
properties of the game.  After playing a test match against the audience,
we show that determining a winning strategy is a PSPACE-complete problem.
<br><br>
Google for 'Atropos Game' for a playable applet of the game.

<br><br>
Kemeny <b>120</b> and TIME: 11:00 AM
<br><br>
<b> Abstract: </b> The type A_{n-1} root polytope is the convex hull in R^n of the origin and 
points e_i-e_j for 1\leq i< j \leq n. We will discuss a connection between 
triangulations of root polytopes and reduced forms of a monomial in an 
algebra generated by n^2 variables x_{ij}, for 1\leq i< j \leq n. We show 
that the reduced form is unique, and corresponds to a canonical 
triangulation of the root polytope in which each simplex corresponds to a 
noncrossing alternating tree.

<br><br>
Kemeny <b>120</b> and TIME: 11:00 AM
<br><br>
<b> Abstract: </b> Alice and Bob share a pizza, radially cut into
slices of various sizes.  Alice gets to pick any
slice to start.  After that they alternate taking
slices, but must always take a slice which is adjacent
to some previously-taken slice. (This is called the
Polite Pizza Protocol.)
<br><br>
Is is possible that the pizza is cut in such a way
that no matter what Alice does, Bob can get more than half?

<br><br>
Kemeny <b>120</b> and TIME: 11:00 AM
<br><br>
<b> Abstract: </b> A graph $G$ is $F$-saturated if $G$ contains no copy of $F$ and any proper 
supergraph of $G$ does.  Tur\'an introduced the problem of determining the 
maximum number of edges of an $F$-saturated $n$-vertex graph.  Here we 
consider the dual problem, determining the minimum number of edges in an 
$F$-saturated $n$-vertex graph.  We present recent results for various 
choices of $F$, survey known results, and give many open problems.<br><br>

This is joint work with Ron Gould, Tomasz Luczak and Oleg Pikhurko.<br><br>

<br><br>
Kemeny <b>108</b> and TIME: 4:00 PM
<br><br>
<b> Abstract: </b> Suppose that n drivers each choose a preferred parking space in a linear car 
park with m spaces. Each driver goes to the chosen space and parks there if it 
is free, and otherwise takes the first available space
with larger number (if any).<br><br>

If all drivers park successfully, the sequence of choices is called a parking 
function. In general, if k drivers fail to park, we have a defective parking 
function of defect k. Let cp(n,m,k) be the number of
such functions.<br><br>

In this talk, we establish a recurrence relation for the cp(n,m,k), and express 
this as an equation for a three-variable generating function. We solve this 
equation using the kernel method, and extract the
coefficients explicitly: it turns out that the cumulative totals are partial 
sums in Abel's binomial identity. Finally, we compute the asymptotics of 
cp(n,m,k) in interesting limiting cases.<br><br>

<br>
<br>
<b> Abstract: </b>A causal set is a countably infinite labelled poset in which every element 
is above finitely many others.  A natural extension of a causal set is an 
order-preserving bijection from the causal set to the set of natural 
numbers.<br><br>

We are interested in random processes that generate a causal set, one 
element at a time.  Alternatively, we are interested in random processes 
that generate a natural extension of a given causal set, again one element 
at a time.  These two notions can be incorporated into a single framework.<br><br>

The talk will focus on some of the interesting probabilistic and 
combinatorial aspects of the work.  I will also mention some connections 
to the theory of Gibbs measures, and to models of the space-time universe.<br><br>

This is joint work with Malwina Luczak.

<br>
<br>
<b> Abstract: </b> 
Let $(a_k)=a_0,a_1,a_2,\ldots$ be a sequence of real numbers.  For
convenience, we let $a_k=0$ if $k<0$.  The sequence is {\it log-concave\/} if
$a_k^2\ge a_{k-1}a_{k+1}$ for all $k$.  Log-concave sequences frequently
appear in algebra, combinatorics, and geometry.  Define the {\it
  $\cL$-operator\/} on sequences by $\cL(a_k)=(b_k)$ where
$$
b_k=a_k^2-a_{k-1}a_{k+1}.
$$
So $(a_k)$ is log-concave if and only if $\cL(a_k)$ is a nonnegative
sequence.  Define $(a_k)$ to be {\it infinitely log-concave\/} if
$\cL^i(a_k)$ is nonnegative for all $i\ge1$.

Boros and Moll conjectured that
the sequence of binomial coefficients
$$
{n\choose0}, {n\choose1}, {n\choose2},\ldots
$$
is infinitely log-concave for any $n\ge0$.
We prove that this conjecture is true  for all $n\le 1450$ by using a computer and a
stronger version of log-concavity.  We also discuss infinite log-concavity of
the columns of Pascal's triangle, $q$-analogues, symmetric functions,
real-rooted polynomials, and Toeplitz matrices.  There will be many
conjectures sprinkled throughout the lecture.
