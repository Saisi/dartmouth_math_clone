 class="messageTextFont">&nbsp; The Schur-Positivity Poset

<br><br>
Kemeny <b>201</b> and TIME: 1:30 PM
<br><br>
<b> Abstract: </b>Determining relations among symmetric functions continues to be a topic of 
considerable interest in algebraic combinatorics.  We will focus on 
relations among Schur functions and their most classical generalization, 
the skew Schur functions.

To any skew shape A, we can associate the skew Schur function s_A.  We can 
then order the set of skew shapes by saying that A \leq B if s_B - s_A is 
Schur-positive, i.e., when expanded in the basis of Schur functions, all 
the coefficients are non-negative.  We call the resulting poset the 
"Schur-positivity poset" on skew shapes.  While much recent work on 
Schur-positivity can be formulated in terms of the Schur-positivity poset, 
a complete understanding of the poset is presently well out of reach. 
After giving the necessary background and introducing the Schur-positivity 
poset, we will present _necessary_ conditions on the shapes of A and B for 
A \leq B. We will conclude with broad open questions in the area.

<br><br>
Kemeny <b>201</b> and TIME: 1:30 PM
<br><br>
<b> Abstract: </b>A "grid shape" is a set of boxes chosen from a square grid; any Young diagram  
is an example. We consider a notion of pattern-avoidance for 0-1 fillings of grid  
shapes, which generalizes permutation pattern-avoidance. A filling avoids some  
patterns if none of its sub-shapes equal any of the patterns. We focus on patterns  
that are pairs of 2 x 2 fillings. For some shapes, fillings that avoid specic  
2 x 2 pairs are in bijection with totally nonnegative Grassmann cells, or with  
acyclic orientations of bipartite graphs. We prove a number of results analogous  
to Wilf-equivalence for these objects --- that is, we show that in various classes  
of shapes, certain pattern pairs are equally restrictive. As an application of  
our results, we are able to give *all* the equivalences, which hold for every  
Young shape (and some other classes). In this talk, I will also give an overview  
of a bijection that proves one of the equivalences.

<br><br>
Kemeny <b>201</b> and TIME: 1:30 PM
<br><br>
<b> Abstract: </b>We will discuss the V = TL equation for classes ordered trees, use it to 
give some easy proofs of some recent results and see how the exponential 
version of the Riordan group come into the picture. Among the classes 
considered are ordered trees, 0.1.2 (Motzkin) trees even trees complete 
and incomplete binary trees, even trees, and red-green trees. The methods 
employed end up being row reduction, matrix multiplication, generating 
functions, and a semidirect product.
