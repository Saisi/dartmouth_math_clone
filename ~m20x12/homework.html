<h1><font color="DarkSlateGray">Homework</font></h1> 
 
</center> 


<p>Homework will be assigned most weeks, for a total of 8 assignments. Assignments will generally be due the week after they're handed out on Wednesday at the beginning of class. Homework solutions should be written legibly in pen or pencil or typed and should be turned in on time. Late homework will not be accepted. 

Homework will be posted on this website (below).</p> 

<p> If you haven't already please make sure you sign and turn in the <a href="ferpa.pdf">FERPA Waiver</a>.</p>

<h1><font color="DarkSlateGray">Problem Sessions (in x-hour)</font></h1> 
 
</center> 


<p>You should notice that 5% of your grade is based on "Problem Sessions". During x-hour, we'll hold problem sessions where you can get points for completing a short assignment. The problems will be slightly harder than homework problems and you will be encouraged to work in groups (though this is not required). If you do work in groups, you can turn in one answer sheet per group, but make sure everyone in the group has signed their name to the sheet you turn in.  

There will be 5-7 x-hours we'll use for these problem sessions and they will be graded credit/no credit. You will need credit for all but one of them to get all 5%. </p>

<h1><font color="DarkSlateGray">Matlab</font></h1> 
 
</center> 
 
 <p>
You may need Matlab for some of your homework assignments this term. You can download Matlab <a href="http://caligari.dartmouth.edu/downloads/matlab/"> here</a>.</p>

<p> Here are the <a href="../~doyle/docs/17/matlab/matlabdemo.pdf"> Matlab demos </a> from the first day of class. </p> 

<p> A few more resources are <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/archive/m46s09/public_html/intro46.m"> Bare Essentials of Matlab</a> by Alex Barnett, <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~statmath/math/matlab/gettingstarted/printable.pdf"> Getting Started with Matlab</a>, and <a href="http://people.oregonstate.edu/~peterseb/mth355/higdon/entirematlab496.pdf">Notes on Matlab</a>. </p>

<h1><font color="DarkSlateGray">Probability Online</font></h1> 
 
</center> 

<p>
Probability Online is a program that has been used for Math 20 during the Summer and Fall terms of 2011. We'll also be using this for our class as a means of checking your Matlab code. Another nice thing is that it provides you with some practice problems (including the even numbered problems from the book) and gives you immediate feedback regarding your answer. 

You can log in to Probability Online <a href="hw/login.php.html">here</a>. Your username is your first name and last initial (all lowercase). So if your name is Peter Parker, then your username is peterp. Your password is your student number.
