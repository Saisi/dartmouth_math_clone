      <td>I will begin with a brief overview of Lorentz geometry, the mathematical setting of general relativity, and how the physical notion of causality is represented in this setting. Regarding space-time as modelled by a Lorentz manifold then motivates some conditions which can be imposed on a Lorentz manifold in terms of its causal structure. With this framework in place, I will then describe the space of null geodesics of a Lorentz manifold, which is naturally a contact manifold. Finally, I will describe some interesting relationships between the geometries of a space-time and its associated space of null geodesics. The presentation will attempt to give a general overview of the subject, and so will not be technically detailed.</td>
