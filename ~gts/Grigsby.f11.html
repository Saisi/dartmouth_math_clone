      <td height="234"><p>The low-dimensional topology community has been energized in recent years by the introduction of a wealth of so-called &quot;homology-type&quot; invariants. One associates to an object in low-dimensional topology (e.g., a link or a 3-manifold) an abstract chain complex whose homology is an invariant of the topological object. Such invariants arise in two apparently different ways: &quot;algebraically,&quot; via the representation theory of quantum groups and &quot;geometrically,&quot; via constructions in symplectic geometry. I will discuss what is known about the relationship between two such invariants: Khovanov homology, an &quot;algebraic&quot; invariant of links and tangles defined by Khovanov and Heegaard-Floer homology, a &quot;geometric&quot; invariant of 3-manifolds defined by Ozsvath-Szabo. The portions of the talk describing my own work are joint with Denis Auroux and Stephan Wehrli.</p>
