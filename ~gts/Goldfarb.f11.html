      <td height="234"><p>One of the main open problems in topology is to establish a<br>
        kind of rigidity similar to that in the recently verified Poincare<br>
        conjecture.  Often two manifolds that are homotopy equivalent are in<br>
        fact homeomorphic.  This is regularly observed in geometry for two<br>
        closed manifolds with contractible universal covers.  In fact,<br>
        topological rigidity is believed to hold for all such manifolds, also<br>
        known as closed aspherical manifolds.  I will describe one modern<br>
        approach to proving this old conjecture of Armand Borel and the recent<br>
        results obtained with a number of collaborators.</p>
