      <td height="260"><p>We will describe a proof that the collection of all compact<br>
        n-dimensional orbifolds with sectional curvature uniformly bounded below,<br>
        diameter bounded above, volume bounded below, and having only isolated<br>
        singular points contains only finitely many orbifold homeomorphism types.<br>
        As a corollary, any isospectral collection of orbifolds with sectional<br>
        curvature uniformly bounded below and having only isolated singular points<br>
        contains only finitely many orbifold homeomorphism types.  The proof<br>
        involves finitely partitioning the collection according to singular data,<br>
        and then showing that any sequence from a particular subcollection has a<br>
        convergent sequence whose limit is also an orbifold.  From there, Perelman's<br>
        stability theorem can be used to obtain the final result.</p>
