Free curves of order smaller than n were studied by Smale, Feldman and Gromov, who showed that they satisfy the h-principle. In particular, when k &lt; n, the space of all based free curves of order k is homotopy equivalent to the loop space on the bundle of k-dimensional frames in the tangent bundle of M.<br>
        When k = n, the h-principle fails to be true already for the simplest examples. I will discuss these examples and show that a somewhat weaker statement holds: for any n &gt; 2 the loop space on the bundle of n-frames in TM is the group completion of the monoid of free curves of order n in M.</p>
