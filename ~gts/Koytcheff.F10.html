      <td height="260"><p> Bott and Taubes considered a bundle over the space of knots whose fiber is a compactified configuration space.  They constructed a knot invariant by performing integration along the fiber of this bundle.  Their method was subsequently used to construct all finite-type (Vassiliev) knot invariants as well as real cohomology classes in spaces of knots in R^n, n &gt; 3.  Replacing integration of differential forms by a Pontrjagin-Thom construction, I have constructed cohomology classes with arbitrary coefficients.  Motivated by work of Budney and F. Cohen on the homology of the space of long knots in R^3, I have also proven a product formula for these classes with respect to connect-sum.  If time permits, I will mention some progress towards further understanding these classes using tools coming from the Goodwillie-Weiss embedding calculus.</p>
