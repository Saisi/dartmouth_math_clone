      <td height="234"><p>A central question in knot theory is whether there a non-trivial knot with trivial Jones polynomial.   The answer has remained elusive because the combinatorial definition of the Jones polynomial, in terms of a link diagram, obscures its geometric content.  In 1999, Khovanov introduced a bigraded homology theory of links in the 3-sphere, whose graded Euler characteristic recovers the Jones polynomial.  Khovanov homology is also combinatorial, yet powerful enough to detect smooth 4-dimensional phenomena that had previously only been accessible to gauge theory.  In this talk, I will review the Jones polynomial and Khovanov's &quot;categorification&quot;, and discuss my work establishing the first explicit connection between Khovanov homology and gauge-theoretic invariants of 3-manifolds.  I'll explain why this implies that the supersymmetric and mod 2 versions of Khovanov homology do not detect Conway mutation, lifting a natural property of the Jones polynomial whose validity remains unknown for Khovanov homology.  And I'll very briefly describe related work of Kronheimer-Mrowka, which resolves the categorified version of the central question.</p>
