      <td>Recent methods of Anantharaman, Nonnenmacher, and others have given good lower bounds for the entropy of quantum limits; in particular, these imply that on a Riemannian manifold of constant negative curvature, eigenfunctions of the Laplacian cannot concentrate more than 1/2 of their (L^2) mass near a closed geodesic.  In joint work with E. Lindenstrauss, we develop similar techniques adapted to the study of large regular graphs, and are able to prove that (under a mild condition) an eigenfunction of the discrete Laplacian cannot have *any* proportion of its mass supported on a ``small&quot; set.  Precisely, any set supporting $\epsilon$ of the mass of an eigenfunction must be of size $(constant)|G|^\delta$ as the size $|G|$ of the graph grows to infinity.</td>
