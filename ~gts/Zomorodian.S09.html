    <tr>
      <td><p>The concept of &quot;persistence&quot; refers to one type of multi-scale analysis: the technique of identifying features by analyzing geometric histories of data.  The key notion is that features _persist_ through history while noise is short-lived.</p>
      <p>My work is focused on turning this intuition into theory for different classes of data via an algebraic approach.  The theory has a practical motivation, serving as the basis of algorithms and software for topological data analysis.  In this talk, I will discuss theories of persistence for static data, parameterized data, and (possibly) dynamic data.</p></td>
