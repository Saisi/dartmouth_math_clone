      <td height="234"><p>The famous Sperner and Tucker's lemmas are combinatorial analogs of the famous Brouwer and  Borsuk-Ulam  theorems. These lemmas have been used for effective computation of fixed points, in root-finding algorithms, and are applied in fair division in algorithms. In this talk will be considered several generalizations of these lemmas and present constructive (algorithmic) proofs. Also will be discussed  a Borsuk-Ulam type theorem for  PL-manifolds with a finite group  action, depending on the free equivariant cobordism class of a manifold. In particular, necessary and sufficient conditions are considered for a manifold with a free involution to be a Borsuk-Ulam type.</p>
