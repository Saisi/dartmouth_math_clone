      <td height="234"><p>This talk will start with a little history on the subject of space forms,<br>
        which are defined as Riemannian manifolds having constant curvature. The<br>
        two dimensional case goes back to Euclid, and the development of non-<br>
        euclidean geometries in the nineteenth century. The three dimensional case<br>
        was solved in the period 1925-1933 thanks to work of Hopf followed by two<br>
        papers of Threlfall and Seifert. The two Threlfall-Seifert papers total 110<br>
        pages and are difficult reading, but in 1961 Hattori published a 3 page paper<br>
        in S&macr;ugaku which gives a new (and obviously simpler and shorter) proof of<br>
        these results. Thanks to work by Luciana Martins, Sadao Massago, Mamoru<br>
        Mimura, and the author, this paper is now translated into English, and will<br>
        be the subject of this talk. The main ingredients of the proof are the use of<br>
        quaternions, Lie groups, and some group theory.</p>
