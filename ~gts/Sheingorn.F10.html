      <td height="260"><p>I study curves of several types on surfaces that are quotients of the<br>
        upper half plane by (most often a low index) subgroup of the modular group. This<br>
        is admittedly a very limited setting, but it is one where number theory affords<br>
        explicit computation and sometimes characterization of trajectories.  Groups<br>
        arising include $\Gamma (1), \Gamma ', \Gamma (3), \Gamma^3$ and $\Gamma(p) \cap<br>
        \Gamma^0(p^2)$, where $p$ is prime and $p \equiv 1(4).$</p>
        <p>Almost always the number theory drives the geometry ... that is, we geometers<br>
          (you geometers?) don't know enough about the trajectories to deduce  number<br>
          theoretic information beyond what is known.</p>
        <p>Related number theory includes the Ankeney-Artin-Chowla  conjecture, the Hardy-<br>
          Littlewood circle method and the Markoff equation $x^2 + y^2 +z^2 = 3xyz$.</p>
        <p>Curves arising are simple geodesics closed and other-wise and horocycles.</p>
        <p>This talk will be an introduction.  If there is interest, I can actually prove<br>
      things on my return from NYC after tax day.</p></td>
