      <td><p>The space $N$ of all future pointing light rays in a strongly causal space time $X$ is a contact manifold. The Legendrian sphere of all light rays through a given point $x\in X$ is called the sky $S_x$ of $x$. For two events $x,y\in X$  we say that $x\leq y$ if $y$ is in the causal future of $x.$ This gives a partial order on the points of a causal spacetime.</p>
        <p>Put $\mathcal S$ to be the space of all Legendrian spheres in $N$ that are isotopic to a sky. For $S_1, S_2\in \mathcal S$ we say that<br>
          $S_1\leq S_2$ if there is a nonpositive Legendrian isotopy of $S_1$ to $S_2.$ As it was shown in the joint work with Stefan Nemirovski<br>
          $S_1\leq S_2$ is a partial order  on $\mathcal S$, provided that $X$ is globally hyperbolic with a Cauchy surface whose universal cover is not compact. In this case $(\mathcal S, \leq)$ is causal and the natural map $X\to \mathcal S$ preserves the partial order. This implies various versions of the  Low conjecture relating causality and linking.</p>
      <p>We discuss various interesting open questions about the partial order on $\mathcal S$. For example is $(\mathcal S, \leq)$ strongly causal with respect to this partial order, is it  true that a ``causal'' future of $S\in \mathcal S$ is closed, is it true that $\leq$ always lifts to a genuine partial order on the universal cover of $\mathcal S.$</p></td>
