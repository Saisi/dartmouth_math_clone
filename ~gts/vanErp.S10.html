      <td><p>In the early 1960s Atiyah and Singer derived a cohomological<br>
        formula that computes the Fredholm index of an elliptic operator. This<br>
        single formula generalizes such classical results as the Gauss-Bonnet<br>
        theorem, the Riemann-Roch theorem, and the Hirzebruch signature<br>
        theorem.</p>
        <p>In subsequent decades, especially in the 1980s, work on the analytic<br>
          K-theory of noncommutative C*-algebras greatly clarified the proof of<br>
          the index formula, leading to many further generalizations. One<br>
          difficulty with some of these generalizations is that it is very hard<br>
          in practice to compute, for an analytically defined K-cycle, the<br>
          corresponding topological K-cycle.</p>
        <p>As an example of this situation I will discuss the solution of the<br>
          index problem for certain hypoelliptic operators on contact manifolds.<br>
          The final formula can be stated in purely topological terms, as a<br>
          modification of the Atiyah-Singer formula, but all the proofs involve<br>
          heavy use of noncommutative topology. I will not attempt to sketch<br>
          these proofs, but hope to outline some of the framework in which the<br>
      problem can be understood.</p></td>
