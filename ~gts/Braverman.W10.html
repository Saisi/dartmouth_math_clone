      <td>The Reidemeister torsion is historically the first invariant of a<br>
        manifold which is not preserved by homotopy.  In 1971, Ray and Singer<br>
        proposed an analytic analogue of the Reidemeister torsion, and conjectured<br>
        that the two invariants are equal. This conjecture was proven 7 years later<br>
        in the celebrated papers by Cheeger and Muller.<br>
In the talk I will review the constructions of the Reidemeister and the<br>
Ray-Singer torsions and also will present a new invariant, the refinedanalytic<br>
torsion, recently introduced by T.Kappeler and myself. The refined analytic<br>
torsion is a holomorphic function on the space of representations of the<br>
fundamental group of a closed odd-dimensional manifold, whose absolute value<br>
is equal to the Ray-Singer torsion and whose phase is given by the<br>
Atiyah-Patody-Singer eta-invariant. The fact that the Ray-Singer torsion and<br>
the eta-invariant can be combined into one holomorphic function allows to<br>
use methods of complex analysis to study both invariants. I will present<br>
some applications of this method. In particular, I will prove a refinement<br>
of the Ray-Singer conjecture, establishing the relationship between the<br>
refined analytic torsion and the Turaev's refinement of the Reidemeister<br>
torsion.</td>
