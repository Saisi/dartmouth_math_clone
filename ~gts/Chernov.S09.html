      <td>Let $(X^{m+1}, g)$ be a globally hyperbolic<br>
        spacetime with Cauchy surface diffeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb<br>
        R^m$. The Legendrian Low conjecture formulated by Nat\'ario and Tod says<br>
        that two events $x,y\in X$ are causally related if and only if the<br>
        Legendrian link of spheres $\mathfrak S_x, \mathfrak S_y$ whose points are<br>
        light geodesics passing through $x$ and $y$ is non-trivial in the contact<br>
        manifold of all light geodesics in $X$. The Low conjecture says that for<br>
        $m=2$ the events $x,y$ are causally related if and only if $\mathfrak S_x,<br>
        \mathfrak S_y$ is non-trivial as a topological link. We prove the Low and<br>
        the Legendrian Low conjectures. We also show that similar statements hold<br>
        for any globally hyperbolic $(X, g)$ such that the universal cover of its<br>
        Cauchy surface is diffeomorphic to an open domain of $\mathbb R^m.$. An<br>
        interesting fact, proved in the joint work with Yuli Rudyak, is that a<br>
        certain weakened version of the Low conjecture is true for all<br>
        nonrefocussing globally hyperbolic spacetimes. This includes all the cases<br>
        where a Cauchy surface has infinite fundamental group or is not a closed<br>
      manifold.</td>
