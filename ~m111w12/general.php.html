<!-- Homework policy information -->
<ul>
<li>Written homework will be posted to
the <a href="assignments.php.html" class="palebg">assignments page</a>, and collected
weekly, due <b>at the beginning</b> of Thursday's class.<br> Homework
assigned on W,F of one week and Monday of the next is due the
following Thursday.
<br><br>

<li>All homework assignments will be posted on the course 
<a href ="assignments.php.html" class="palebg">assignments page</a>.  
<br><br>

<li>Late homework will not be accepted in the absence of divine
intervention or matters of similar weight.  Starting assignments early
will assure you have at least some work to submit for grading.

<br><br>


<li>Homework is to be written <b>neatly</b> using one side of 8 1/2 x
11 inch paper.  Do <b>not</b> use paper from a spiral notebook unless
you can tear off the ragged edge.  Feel free to use paper which has
been recyled with printing on only one side. All papers are to be
stapled.  LaTeX source will be available for those who wish to TeX
their solutions, hopefully many!
<br><br>

<li>Use <b>English</b>.  If you can't read your solutions aloud as
fluently as if you were reading your textbook, try using nouns and
verbs in your write ups!  Give references for theorems or propositions
you use from the text and class. 
<br><br>

<li><b>Consult the honor principle (below) as it applies to this course.</b>

</table>
<p>

<!-- Honor Principle details -->

<p>
<b>On Homework:</b> Collaboration is permitted and encouraged,
but <b>no copying </b>.  <b class="red">What a student turns in as a
homework solution is to be his or her own understanding of how to do
the problems. Students must state what sources they have consulted,
with whom they have collaborated, and from whom they have received
help.</b> The solutions you submit must be written by you alone. Any
copying (electronic or otherwise) of another person's solutions, in
whole or in part, is a violation of the Honor Code.
 

<p />Moreover, if in working with someone they have provided you with
an important idea or approach, they should be explicitly given credit
in your writeup. Hints that I give in office hours need not be cited. Note:
It is not sufficient to annotate your paper with a phrase like ``I
worked with Joe on all the problems.'' Individual ideas are to be
credited at each instance; they represent intellectual property.



<p />

<b>On Exams:</b> <b class="red">Students may not receive assistance of
any kind from any source (living, published, electronic, etc), except
the professor, and may not give assistance to anyone.  Matters of
clarification are to be left to the professor.</b>

<p />

If you have any questions as to whether some action would be
acceptable under the Academic Honor Code, please speak to me, and I
will be glad to help clarify things. It is always easier to ask
beforehand.

<p>


Tutorial assistance for this course, that is, help with your homework,
will be available in 102 Bradley, Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays
evenings 7 - 10pm.  Tutorials will begin on Thursday, September 26.
<P>

Also note that the Tutor Clearinghouse will have private one-on-one
tutors available for Math 8.  The tutors are recruited on the basis
that they have done well in the subject, and are trained by the
Academic Skills Center.  If a student receives financial aid, the
College will pay for three hours of tutoring per week.  If you would
like to have a tutor, please go to 301 Collis and fill out an
application as early in the term as possible.

<p>


<!-- Disabilities statement --> 

<p> I encourage any students with
disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities such as chronic
diseases and learning disabilities, to discuss appropriate
accommodations with me, which might help you with this class, either
after class or during office hours. Dartmouth College has an active
program to help students with disabilities, and I am happy to do
whatever I can to help out, as appropriate.  
</p>

<p>Any student with a documented disability requiring academic
adjustments or accommodations is requested to speak with me by the end
of the second week of the term. All discussions will remain
confidential, although the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~accessibility/" class="palebg">
Student Accessibility Services
</a>  may be consulted to
verify the documentation of the disability and advise on an
appropriate response to the need. It is important, however, that you
talk to me soon, so that I can make whatever arrangements might be
needed in a timely fashion.
</p>

<p>Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that
occur during this academic term.  If you have a religious observance
that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with
me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss
appropriate accommodations.
</p>
