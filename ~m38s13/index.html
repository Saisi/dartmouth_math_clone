		  <td>
			<p style="text-align : justify">  A graph is nothing more than a collection of points
			(called "vertices") some pairs of which are connected by lines (called "edges").
			The simplicity of the definition means that graphs are ubiquitous as models, used
			for the world-wide web, biological systems, transportation networks, economic markets and countless other
			applications.  Nonetheless, graph theory underlies important concepts and sometimes
			deep theorems of mathematics. </p>
			<p style="text-align : justify"> Because the raw material of graph theory is so
			elementary, the subject is, in addition to its intrinsic interest, a great canvas
			upon which to learn the whole process of mathematics: experiment, conjecture, proof.
			In particular, if you've always been uncomfortable with proofs---unsure when an
			argument constitutes a proof, and/or clueless about how to construct one---this is
			a great place to turn your weakness into a strength.
