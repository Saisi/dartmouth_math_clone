<h3>WeBWorK</h3>

WeBWorK can be accessed <a href="https://webwork.dartmouth.edu/webwork2/m13w11/">here</a>. A list of functions that can be used in WeBWorK and advice on entering answers can be found <a href="http://webwork.maa.org/wiki/Available_Functions">here</a>.


<h3>Written Homework</h3>

In general, written assignments will be due every Wednesday and will cover the material in the previous week's classes. Assignments must be turned in by 12:30 p.m. on their due dates in the boxes outside 105 Kemeny. Look for the columns of boxes for Math 13, Winter 2011 and put your homework in the box on the <b>left</b> corresponding to the first letter of your family name (A-F, G-M, N-S, T-Z).

If you have signed and returned the <a href="FERPA_M13W11.pdf">FERPA waiver</a>, you can collect your homework from the box on the <b>right</b> corresponding to the first letter of your family name. If you do not give me a signed copy of the waiver, you can collect your homework during office hours by showing me your Dartmouth ID.

<p>
<b>March 16, 2011:</b> I've removed the solutions to the homework assignments so future classes won't have access to them.

That was your last homework assignment! Now start studying for the final! I've posted a list of problems from sections 17.8 and 17.9 that I might have assigned as homework problems on the course's home page under "Study Materials."
