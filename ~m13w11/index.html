<p>We will be using the 6th edition of <i>Calculus</i> by James Stewart (ISBN 9780495011606).<br>

This is the book that was used for Math 8 in the fall semester. If you don't have a copy yet, you can buy it at <a href="http://www.wheelockbooks.com">Wheelock Books</a> or try to find another student willing to sell you his or her used copy.
</p>

<p>I've also put two supplemental texts on reserve in Baker-Berry:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Div, grad, curl, and all that,</i> H.M. Schey, ISBN 9780393925166. <br>
This book takes a more informal and physics-inspired approach to the material in the second half of the class.  It is well-written, contains many exercises, and is not particularly long, so this book might be a useful supplement to the main text. 

<li><i>Calculus on manifolds: a modern approach to classical theorems of advanced calculus,</i> Michael Spivak, ISBN 9780805390216.<br>
This book is for more ambitious students who are interested in understanding the material in the second half of the class in a more general context. Students who intend to major in mathematics or theoretical physics will be the ones who find this book relevant. 
</ul>

</p>

<p>There will be two sections of this course, and they will run almost identically: the material covered will be the same in both sections, and grades will be assigned as if all students are attending the same lecture. An general schedule for the course is available <a href="schedule.html">here</a>.
</p>

<b>Period 12 (Section 1):</b>
<ul>
<li> Lecture: MWF 12:30-1:35 p.m.
<li> x-hour: Tu 1:00-1:50 p.m.
<li> Room: 028 Silsby Hall
</ul>

<b>Period 2 (Section 2):</b>
<ul>
<li> Lecture: MWF 1:45-2:50 p.m.
<li> x-hour: Th 1:00-1:50 p.m.
<li> Room: 008 Kemeny Hall
</ul>


<p>We will use x-hours on occasion, but not frequently. Any time we'll need to use an x-hour, I will announce it in class and by e-mail well in advance.</p>

<p>
There will be two midterm exams and a final exam in this course. The midterms will take place from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on January 26 and February 16 in Silsby 028. If you have a scheduling conflict, please let me know as soon as possible. </p>

The final exam will take place on March 12 at 3:00 p.m. in Carpenter 013. Please don't make any travel plans that will conflict with this, since all Math 13 students are expected to take the final at the assigned time.

</p>

<p> </p>

<p>You will have two kinds of homework. The first is online homework using <a href="https://webwork.dartmouth.edu/webwork2/m13w11/">WeBWorK</a>. WeBWorK problems will be assigned for each class day and will be due on at 8:00 a.m. on the day of the second following class (in general, problems covering Monday's material will be due the next Friday, problems covering Wednesday's material will be due the next Monday, and problems covering Friday's material will be due the next Wednesday). You will only be able to submit the assignment during the time that the problem set is open because answers will be released almost immediately after the submission deadline.</p>

<p>The second kind of homework is traditional written work. These problems will be assigned weekly. In general, they will be due on Wednesdays at 12:30 p.m., and they will cover the material discussed in the previous week. No late assignments will be accepted except under the most extreme circumstances. If you have an emergency that you think may be an extreme circumstance, please let me know as soon as possible. However, the lowest written homework score will be dropped, and if you submit an assignment up to a week late, you will still receive comments but no grade.<!--, and they will be due Wednesday at some time. Talk to other people about this. -->
</p>

<p>
Please submit your written homework assignments in the boxes outside 105 Kemeny. Look for the column of boxes labeled "Math 13, Winter 2011" and put your assignment in the <b>left</b> ("IN") column corresponding to the first letter of your family name (A-F, G-M, N-S, T-Z).
</p>

<p>
If you have signed and returned the <a href="FERPA_M13W11.pdf">FERPA waiver</a>, you can collect your homework from the box on the <b>right</b> corresponding to the first letter of your family name. If you do not give me a signed copy of the waiver, you can collect your homework during office hours by showing me your Dartmouth ID.

<p>The course grade will be determined as follows (out of 400 points):</p>

<ul>
<li>2 midterm exams: 75 points each

<li>Final exam: 150 points

<li>WeBWorK homework: 50 points

<li>Written homework: 50 points

Note that the lowest <b>written homework grade</b> will be dropped.

</p>


<p>I expect you to abide by the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~uja/honor/">Dartmouth Academic Honor Principle</a> at all times. There should be no help given or received on exams, and you will not be allowed to use abaci, calculators, computers, cell phones, or other electronic or computational aids. The most technologically advanced device you will be allowed to use is a mechanical pencil. 
</p>

<p>
On the homework, however, collaboration is not only permitted but encouraged. You are welcome to discuss the problems with your classmates, tutors, and instructor. However, you must write up and submit your assignments individually, and you must list all the other students you discussed the problems with at the top of your assignment. You are allowed to use calculators and other electronic aids on the homework.

Last year's first midterm is available <a href="math13_winter2010_midterm1.pdf">here</a>. You don't need to worry about question 6 (the one about a lamina).
</p>

<p>
Last year's second midterm is available <a href="math13_winter2010_midterm2.pdf">here</a>. I consider all the problems on it to be reasonable for your second midterm as well as question 6 on the previous year's first midterm.</p>

<p>

I've organized a field trip to the Special Collections at Rauner during the last x-hours of the term: March 3 if your x-hour is Thursday and March 8 if your x-hour is Tuesday. Show up in the Ticknor Room in Rauner at 1:00 on those days and see some of Dartmouth's antique math texts and learn about the history of math at Dartmouth!
