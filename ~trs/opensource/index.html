<h3>Open Source Endeavors at Dartmouth</h3> </center> The following
are some of the efforts going forth at Dartmouth concerning Open
Source.  The efforts mentioned below are restricted to those of which
I have personal knowledge, and do not accurately reflect all the
endeavors at the College.  <p>

A <a href="resolution2_april2003_approved-1.pdf">resolution</a> was
passed in April 2003 by the University of Buffalo faculty senate in
support of Linux and Open Source in general. This resolution was
sufficient impetus for a discussion of Open Source to gain a slot on
the agenda of the College's <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/comp/about/committees/council/">Council
on Computing</a> that May.  A presentation was made to the Council by
members Thomas Shemanske and Robinson Tryon, and invited guest Joseph
Hill.  The presentation focussed on open file formats and was an
attempt to raise the general level of consciousness of the Council
members.  The presenters were especially grateful for the feedback
they received on drafts of the proposal from the Linux Users group on
campus (<b>linux-users</b> at <b>listserv</b> dot <b>dartmouth</b> dot
<b>edu</b>).  The text of that proposal [Promoting Open File Formats
and Open Source at Dartmouth] is <a href="CoC.pdf">here</a>.  <p> The
ensuing discussion was robust, with some appreciation for open file
formats, and an agreement to field test OpenOffice over the course of
the summer.  The experience with OpenOffice was mixed, those with
Windows machines having a somewhat better experience, but there
remained the attitude that replacing the current office suite with
OpenOffice should be seamless, when no transition of this magnitude
can be. <p>

In Council meetings during the winter of 2004, an issue was raised
concerning the development of software by the College's research
computing group, and the question of licensing and ownership was
raised.  This turned into an interesting discussion which began to
bump into issues of Open Source and the GPL.  I asked the chair of the
Council to consider adding another meeting about Open Source to the
Council's agenda, and that meeting took place on April, 8, 2004.
Unfortunately it was the third item on a full agenda, and there was
only a brief time for presentation and discussion.  This time, the
proposal took a much broader perspective, hoping to gather some
momentum for an institutionally supported Open Source initiative.  For
reference, the text of the most recent proposal [Promoting Open Source
at Dartmouth] is <a href="CoC-2004.pdf">here</a>.  Minutes of that
meeting are <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/comp/about/committees/council/minutes/2004/coc-0404.html"
target="_blank">here</a> (no longer available).  At the final meeting
of the year, the College did choose to provide official support for
Mozilla-Thunderbird, mozilla.org's Open Source email client, based
largely upon its feature set and cross-platform availability.  <p>

Aside from it's support for Thunderbird, the College has chosen not to
offer much more than "conceptual support" for an Open Source
initiative.  Given institutional reluctance to move forward with such
an initiative, the Mathematics Department has decided to begin its own
commitment to Open Source.  As a modest first step, beginning mid June
2004, the department staff will all be using Open Office (on Windows)
as the "application of first choice" when dealing with text documents
and spread sheets. In dealings with departments outside of our own,
the staff will get a good workout using OpenOffice's filters to import
and export documents in proprietary formats.  And even internally,
some reeducation is necessary: in particular, that plain text and pdf
are two exceptionally fine file formats.  Adding faculty support to
our department's effort will be more difficult since most of our
faculty either use TeX, or are Macintosh users for which the
installation and use of OpenOffice is not as smooth as for Linux and
Windows platforms.  Nonetheless, it is a small beginning.

<p>
<b>Further developments:</b>
<ul>
<li>June 2004:  Dartmouth has become a member of <a href="http://www.sakaiproject.org/">Sakai</a>'s educational
partners program [SEPP].  There will be consideration of Sakai as an
Open Source course management system.
<br>
<li> June 27, 2004: <a href="http://porting.openoffice.org/mac/ooo-osx_downloads.html">OpenOffice.org 1.1.2</A> for Mac OS X (X11) released putting the Mac OS X
version on par with Windows and Linux.  
<li> October 2005:  OpenOffice 2.0 released using OASIS (open) document formats

<li> December 2008: OpenOffice 3.0 released: This version includes
some important new features like native Mac OS X compatibility and
support for version 1.2 of the OpenDocument Format standard. It also
introduces support for reading files in Microsoft's Office Open XML
(OOXML) format, which is used as the default in Microsoft Office 2007.
