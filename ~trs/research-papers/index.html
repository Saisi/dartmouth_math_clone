<li><h3>Selective Orders in Central Simple Algebras</h3>
 Let $B$ be a central simple algebra of degree $n$ over a number
  field $K$, and let $L/K$ be a field extension of degree $n$ which
  embeds in $B$.  The question of which of the isomorphism classes of
  maximal orders in $B$ admit an embedding of an $\mathcal{O}_K$-suborder
  $\Omega$ of $\mathcal{O}_L$ is the question of selectivity of the order
  $\Omega$. In this paper we are concerned with algebras of degree $n \ge 3$,
  and continue the work of several authors to characterize the degree
  to which and conditions under which selectivity will occur.  We take
  a local approach via the theory of affine buildings which provides
  explicit information about the structure of local embeddings, and
  leverage that information to produce a global characterization.  We
  clarify that selectivity can never occur in an algebra which is a
  division algebra at a finite prime as well as construct
  representatives of the isomorphism classes of maximal orders which do admit
  embeddings of $\Omega$.  An example of selectivity in an algebra
  with partial ramification is provided. <br />

<li><h3>Embedding Orders into Central Simple Algebras</h3> 

The question of embedding fields into central simple algebras $B$ over
a number field $K$ was the realm of class field theory. The subject of
embedding orders contained in the ring of integers of maximal
subfields $L$ of such an algebra into orders in that algebra is more
nuanced. The first such result along those lines is an elegant result
of Chevalley \cite{Chevalley-book} which says that with $B = M_n(K)$
the ratio of the number of isomorphism classes of maximal orders in
$B$ into which the ring of integers of $L$ can be embedded (to the
total number of classes) is $[L \cap \widetilde K : K]^{-1}$ where
$\widetilde K$ is the Hilbert class field of $K$. Chinburg and
Friedman (\cite{Chinburg-Friedman}) consider arbitrary quadratic
orders in quaternion algebras satisfying the Eichler condition, and
Arenas-Carmona \cite{Arenas-Carmona} considers embeddings of the ring
of integers into maximal orders in a broad class of higher rank
central simple algebras. In this paper, we consider central simple
algebras of dimension $p^2$, $p$ an odd prime, and we show that
arbitrary commutative orders in a degree $p$ extension of $K$, embed
into none, all or exactly one out of $p$ isomorphism classes of
maximal orders. Those commutative orders which are selective in this
sense are explicitly characterized; class fields play a pivotal
role. A crucial ingredient of Chinberg and Friedman's argument was the
structure of the tree of maximal orders for $SL_2$ over a local
field. In this work, we generalize Chinburg and Friedman's results
replacing the tree by the Bruhat-Tits building for $SL_p$.  <br />

<li><h3>Split Orders and Convex Polytopes in Buildings</h3>
 As part of his work to develop an explicit trace formula for Hecke
  operators on congruence subgroups of $SL_2({\mathbb{Z}})$, Hijikata
  \cite{Hijikata-traces} defines and characterizes the notion of a
  split order in $M_2(k)$, where $k$ is a local field.  In this paper,
  we generalize the notion of a split order to $M_n(k)$ for $n>2$ and
  give a natural geometric characterization in terms of the affine
  building for $SL_n(k)$.  In particular, we show that there is a
  one-to-one correspondence between split orders in $M_n(k)$ and a
  collection of convex polytopes apartmentsilding such that
  the split order is the intersection of all the maximal orders
  representing the vertices in the polytope.  This generalizes the
  geometric interpretation in the $n=2$ case in which split orders
  correspond to geodesics in the tree for $SL_2(k)$ with the split
  order given as the intersection of the endpoints of the geodesic.

<li><h3>Constructing Simultaneous Hecke Eigenforms</h3>
  It is well known that newforms of integral weight are simultaneous
  eigenforms for all the Hecke operators, and that the converse is not
  true.  In this paper, we give a characterization of all simultaneous
  Hecke eigenforms associated to a given newform, and provide several
  applications.  These include determining the number of linearly
  independent simultaneous eigenforms in a fixed space which
  correspond to a given newform, and characterizing several situations
  in which the full space of cusp forms is spanned by a basis
  consisting of such eigenforms.  Part of our results can be seen as a
  generalization of results of Choie-Kohnen \cite{Choie-Kohnen} who
  considered diagonalization of ``bad'' Hecke operators on spaces with
  square free level and trivial character.  Of independent interest,
  but used herein, is a lower bound for the dimension of the space of
  newforms with arbitrary character.

<li><h3>Inverting the Satake Map for $Sp_n$, and applications to Hecke
Operators</h3>
 By compatibly grading the $p$-part of the Hecke algebra associated
  to $Sp_n({\mathbb{Z}})$ and the subring of ${\mathbb{Q}}[x_0^{\pm1}, \dots,x_n^{\pm1}]$
  invariant under the associated Weyl group, we produce a matrix
  representation of the Satake isomorphism restricted to the
  corresponding finite dimensional components.  In particular, using
  the elementary divisor theory of integral matrices, we show how to
  determine the entries of this matrix representation restricted to
  double cosets of a fixed similitude. The matrix representation is
  upper-triangular, and can be explicitly inverted.
<br />
  To address the specific question of characterizing families of Hecke
  operators whose generating series have ``Euler'' products, we define
  $(n+1)$ families of polynomial Hecke operators $t_k^n(p^\ell)$ (in
  ${\mathbb{Q}}[x_0^{\pm1}, \dots,x_n^{\pm1}]$) for $Sp_n$ whose generating
  series $\sum t_k^n(p^\ell) v^\ell$ are rational functions of the
  form $q_k(v)^{-1}$, where $q_k$ is a polynomial in ${\mathbb{Q}}[x_0^{\pm1},
  \dots,x_n^{\pm1}][v]$ of degree $2^k\binom{n}{k}$ ($2^n$ if $k =
  0$). For $k=0$ and $k=1$ the form of the polynomial is essentially
  that of the local factors in the spinor and standard zeta functions.
  For $k>1$, these appear to be new expressions.  Taking advantage of
  the generating series and our ability to explicitly invert the
  Satake isomorphism, we explicitly compute the classical operators
  with the analogous properties in the case of genus 2.  It is of
  interest to note that these operators lie in the full, but not
  generally the integral, Hecke algebra.

<li><h3>The Arithmetic and Combinatorics of Buildings for $Sp_n$</h3>
 In this paper, we investigate both arithmetic and combinatorial
  aspects of buildings and associated Hecke operators for $Sp_n(K)$
  with $K$ a local field.  We characterize the action of the affine
  Weyl group in terms of a symplectic basis for an apartment,
  characterize the special vertices as those which are self-dual with
  respect to the induced inner product, and establish a one-to-one
  correspondence between the special vertices in an apartment and the
  elements of the quotient ${\mathbb{Z}}^{n+1}/{\mathbb{Z}}(2,1,\dots,1)$.
<br />
  We then give a natural representation of the local Hecke algebra
  over $K$ acting on the special vertices of the Bruhat-Tits
  building for $Sp_n(K)$.  Finally, we give an application of the
  Hecke operators defined on the building by characterizing minimal
  walks on the building for $Sp_n$.

<li><h3>Hecke Operators, Zeta Functions and the Satake Map</h3>

 Hecke operators $t_k^n(p^\ell)$ for $Sp_n$ whose generating series
  $\sum t_k^n(p^\ell) u^\ell$ are rational functions of the form
  $q_k(u)^{-1}$, where $q_k$ is a polynomial of degree
  $2^k\binom{n}{k}$ ($2^n$ if $k = 0$).  For $k=0$ and $k=1$ the form
  of the polynomial is essentially that of the local factors in the
  spinor and standard zeta functions.  For $k>1$, these appear to be
  new expressions.
<br />
   We also offer some insight (disjoint from the representation theory)
  for why there should be a correspondence between the local Hecke
  algebra and a ring of polynomials invariant under an associated Weyl
  group.

<li><h3>Hecke Operators for GL<sub>n</sub> and buildings</h3>
We describe a representation of the local Hecke algebra for $GL_n$
  in which the Hecke operators act on the vertices of the Bruhat-Tits
  building for $SL_n({\mathbb{Q}}p)$.  We also give a geometric interpretation
  of this representation, characterizing the action of our operators
  on a vertex in terms of the endpoints of minimal walks in the
  building.  This generalizes work of Serre who defined Hecke
  operators acting on the vertices of a tree (the building for
  $SL_2({\mathbb{Q}}p)$).

<h3>Rationality Theorems for Hecke Operators on GL_n </h3>
 We define $n$ families of Hecke operators $T_k^n(p^\ell)$ for $GL_n$
  whose generating series $\sum T_k^n(p^\ell) u^\ell$ are rational
  functions of the form $q_k(u)^{-1}$ where $q_k$ is a polynomial of
  degree $\binom{n}{k}$, and whose form is that of the $k$th exterior
  product.  This work can be viewed as a refinement of work of
  Andrianov \cite{Andrianov70}, in which he defined Hecke operators
  the sum of whose generating series was a rational function
  with nontrivial numerator and whose denominator was essentially
  $\prod_k q_k$.
<br />
  
  By a careful analysis of the Satake map which defines an isomorphism
  between a local Hecke algebra and a ring of symmetric polynomials,
  we define $n$ families of (polynomial) Hecke operators and
  characterize their generating series as rational functions.  We then
  give an explicit means by which to locally invert the Satake
  isomorphism, and show how to translate these polynomial operators
  back to the classical double coset setting. The classical Hecke
  operators have generating series of exactly the same form as their
  polynomial counterparts, and hence are of number-theoretic interest.
  We give explicit examples for $GL_3$ and $GL_4$.
