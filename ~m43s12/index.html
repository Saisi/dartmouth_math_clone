  <li> 3/14/2012: First version of this webpage goes up.  If you are taking this class, please read this webpage carefully, especially the sections on <a href = "index.html#Grading">grading</a> and <a href = "index.html#Homework">homework</a>.</li>

<h2><a id = "Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>	

<p>
Math 43 is an introduction to the theory of functions of a single complex variable.  
In other words, Math 43 is about calculus on single variable functions which accept
and take values in complex numbers instead of real numbers.  We will discuss
differentiation and integration of complex functions, and explore the many 
consequences that complex differentiability implies.  A major goal of this class
is to discuss the Cauchy integral theorem and its corollaries.  We will also 
discuss product factorizations of everywhere complex differentiable functions 
(entire functions), and if time permits, we will examine applications to the
gamma and (Riemann) zeta functions, and a proof of the Prime Number Theorem.  
</p>

<p> Although the official ORC pre-requisite for this class is only multivariable
calculus, some knowledge of real analysis will be handy.  We will not assume
any real analysis background, but will quickly discuss and review relevant
ideas that subject when necessary.

<h2><a id = "Exams">Examination Schedule </a></h2>

<p> There will be four 45 minute midterms, administered during the X-hour,
and a final exam.  A limited amount of notes will probably be permitted
during each exam, but no computational aids will be allowed on exams. 

<ul>
    <li> Midterm 1: Thursday, April 5, 2012, 12:00pm - 12:50pm, our classroom </li>
    <li> Midterm 2: Thursday, April 19, 2012, 12:00pm - 12:50pm, our classroom </li>
    <li> Midterm 3: Thursday, May 3, 2012, 12:00pm - 12:50pm, our classroom</li>
    <li> Midterm 4: Thursday, May 17, 2012, 12:00pm - 12:50pm, our classroom</li>
    <li> Final Exam: Friday, June 1, 2012, 8:00am - 11:00am, 007 Kemeny (our usual classroom) </li>
</ul>

</p>

<p> If you are unable to be at any of these exams, please contact me as soon as possible so we can setup alternate test-taking arrangements. </p>


<h2><a id = "Grading">Grading</a></h2>

 <p>
Your grade in this class will be determined by homework and exams.
</p>

<p>
Weekly written assignments will consist of questions which usually cover the material
from the previous week.  Questions will typically involve computing a certain
quantity or proving a particular statement.  In either case, answers must be justified
using clear and reasonably complete arguments.  
Written homework will be due on Monday afternoons.  </p>

<p>
There will be four 45 minute midterm exams, administered during the X-hour,
and a final exam.  They will probably be limited open note exams.
</p> 

<p> 
Each of the above contributes to your final grade in the following fashion:
<ul>
    <li> Homework: 40% </li>
    <li> Midterms: 7.5% each, 30% total </li>
    <li> Final exam: 30% </li>
</ul>

</p>

<h2><a id="Homework">Homework Policy</a></h2> 
<p>
Written homework assignments will be posted at the <a href = "https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/homework.html">homework page</a> of this website, and will be usually due about a week after they are posted.  Late assignments will only be accepted when granted an extension, which must be requested from the instructor several days in advance.  In general, extensions will only be granted for health-related reasons or family emergencies.  Exceptions may be made for school-related travel. </p>

<p>
The homework collaboration policy for this class is more or less in line with other Dartmouth math classes.  You are allowed to collaborate with others on homework, but must write your own solutions.  A good rule of thumb is that you should never be copying phrases or sentences from anyone else or any source.  You may use theorems, lemmas, etc. that we have covered from the textbook, but in general you should not use theorems, lemmas, etc. from sections of the book we have not covered or from external sources.  Also, please write down the people you collaborated with and outside sources (namely, anything besides the required textbook) you consulted on your homework assignments.  
</p>

<h2><a id = "Textbook">Textbook</a></h2> 
 <p>
 The required book for this class is <em>Complex Analysis</em>, by Elias Stein and Rami Shakarchi, ISBN 978-0691113852.
 This relatively new book is one part of a series of texts on real and complex analysis that grew out of
 teaching the analysis sequence for undergraduates at Princeton University.  As this sequence is one of the best,
 if not the best, analysis sequence for math majors in the country, the quality of the exposition and choice of topics
 in this book (and the other books in this series) are fantastic.  <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_M._Stein">Elias Stein</a> is one of the leading world authorities in analysis (in particular, harmonic analysis),
 and has had decades of experience teaching top undergraduate and graduate students.  Another plus of this book is that
 it contains a lot of content, yet is reasonably priced.      
 </p>

<p> There are many books about complex analysis.  The following are a few books which might be worth consulting:</p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Complex Analysis</em>, 3rd Edition, by Lars Ahlfors, ISBN 978-0070006577. </br>

    This book is considered a classic text in the field.  It was also written by a top mathematician
    (Ahlfors received the Fields Medal), but the price of the book is incredibly high.  
    Nevertheless, it might be worthwhile to check this book out in the library.
</li>

<li> <em>Real and Complex Analysis</em>, 3rd Edition, by Walter Rudin, ISBN 978-0070542341. </br>

This book is considered one of the standard texts in analysis.  We are not using it since most of
the book is devoted to real analysis, and the level of sophisticiation is slightly higher than 
what we are aiming for in this class.  Nevertheless, it might be worth taking a look at this book
after taking this class and a class in real analysis.   
</li>

<li> <em>Complex Analysis</em>, 3rd Edition, by Joseph Bak and Donald Newman, ISBN 978-1441972873. </br>

This book is probably not as well known as the others listed above, but I used it
as an undergraduate and found it very well-written.  The book is aimed squarely at undergraduate
students (unlike the previous two books listed above), and is quite enjoyable to read.
