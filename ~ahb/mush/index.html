Here are movies of the 336 odd-symmetry
eigenmodes in wavenumber range [90,100],
computed using the scaling method. The mode number is around 1700.
Only the right-half of the mushroom is shown:

Raw eigenmodes, with mode number <i>j</i> increasing in time.
The intensity |&phi<sub>j</sub>|<sup>2</sup> is shown, with white
zero and larger values darker.
`Migrating scars' are actually visible in this movie, but only when you
know what to look for. They are mush clearer in the following.

<p>Local density of states over the same wavenumber interval.
This is essentially the previous movie smoothed in wavenumber by
a Gaussian of width 0.12. Look for the migrating scars
moving down the middle of the left-hand wall (the symmetry axis).
You may want to
set your movie player on loop.

Migrating scars are believed to be a general phenomenon observed
in the self-focal planes of reflective arcs (<i>ie</i> near the
center of curvature), moving towards the self-focal
point as wavenumber increases.

<hr>

The classical (ray) paths contributing to this scar phenomenon
are illustrated in the time domain by the following movie (10MB):

</table>

White has been used to highlight large ray phase space densities.
Notice that nearly perfect refocusing of rays occurs at the launch point
just after t=3.0 and t=6.0, but not at multiples of 3 after that.
