<p>
Despite the recent appearance of some good books on the connections between music and mathematics, there are very few teaching activities available that
bring this exciting material into the high-school math curriculum.
What activities we found online were also of low quality, and some were
not even scientifically correct.
This motivated us to develop a fresh set of activities that teach
the connection between graphs of functions, period, frequency,
musical pitches and intervals, the speed of sound, and the harmonic series.
We developed and field-tested these with 7th and 8th-graders who have
had Algebra I, over three weeks near the end of their school year in 2013, and they gave very positive feedback (they loved it).
<!--although we found that it also engaged students with much more mathematics background.-->

<p>
In our module, students learn how to record the pressure-vs-time
graphs using the free software <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net"><code>audacity</code></a>, measure the period and hence frequency of sustained
sounds, related this to musical pitches, and
build and measure their own instruments - sets of 5-note pan pipes - using
lengths of straws that they have computed using pitches from various
musical scales (blues, pentatonic, diatonic, etc).
Students are guided by worksheets, able to test their understanding with
homework questions, and their work culminates in a mini-concert playing tunes to the class on their pipes.
The module takes around 4 1-hour class periods in total (not including homework).

<p>
This strengthens students' basic algebra skills, opens their
eyes (and ears) to real-world applied mathematics and waves,
allows them to form hypotheses and test them in a hands-on
setting, and builds confidence playing music in front of the
class.
The module content and style builds upon Barnett's experience developing the college course
<a href="../../~m5f11/index.html">Math 5:
<i>The Mathematics of Music and Sound</i></a>, and the experience graduate student Martinez
brought as a year-long
visiting instructor at the <a href="http://www.newton.k12.vt.us/">Newton School</a> in Strafford, VT, through the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~academicoutreach/gk12/">GK-12 project</a> (and her experience as a flautist!)

<p>
Here is the module we developed (write-up courtesy of Martinez):
<a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/musicmathmodule.pdf">Periods, Pitches, and Pipes (PDF, 11MB)</a>

<p>
This PDF file includes lesson plans, lists of class materials, instructions
with photographs, worksheets and homework, and
grading rubrics for the final project.
During the final mini-concert we recommend hooking a mic into a computer and projecting the
free software <a href="http://www.baudline.com/"><code>baudline</code></a> to the whole class to visualize the frequencies produced in real time.

<p>
Please contact us if you have any questions. Enjoy!
