Electric fields are vector fields.
Charges are responsible for <i>divergence</i>
(sources of the field).

In this course we generalize
ideas of differential and integral calculus to two and three dimensions.
As well as giving us tools to model the real, three-dimensional world
through physics, chemistry, engineering,
etc (as in the pictures above),
this is also essential to understanding functions of many variables
in more abstract situations, such as arise in
computer science, economics, and statistics and probability.
The emphasis will be on intuition, visualization, and problem-solving,
rather than theorem-lemma-proof.
I am a physicist by training and I am sure this
will show.

<h4>Exams:</h4>
<ul>
<li><font color="#ff0000"><a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/mid1.pdf">Midterm1</a></font>,
in class W Feb 19, 9am-10am. No calculators or cheat sheets.
You will be given the harder-to-remember formulae.
Please practise with the <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/mid1_sam.pdf">Sample Midterm1</a>,
eventually checking against <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/mid1_sam_sol.pdf">answers (corrected)</a>.
<li>Midterm1 solutions: I made a mistake in 3. Method A. You should
replace it with <i>d = |r_o|sin theta = |r_o cross v| divided by |v|</i>.
Best is to get notes from
lecture 10 (W Feb 26).
<li><font color="#ff0000"><a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/mid2.pdf">Midterm2</a></font>,
in class M Apr 7, 9am-10am. Calculators allowed.
You may bring a single-page formula sheet of your own (few standard
formulae will be provided). Practise with <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/mid2_sam.pdf">
Sample Midterm2</a> (including lists of Stewart practise problems),
with <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/mid2_sam_sol.pdf">answers</a>.
This sample exam may be a little longer than the real one.
<li><font color="#ff0000"><a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/fin.pdf">Final</a></font>, in usual
classroom, Wed May 7,
10am-11:50. Calculators and double-sided formula sheet allowed.
Answers (not full solutions) are <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/fin_ans.pdf">here</a>.

<li>Solutions to HW4: 15.3.48, I wrote sec^2 x rather than sec^2 2x
throughout. Please correct your copy.
<li>Lecture Mon 3 Mar: `enjoyment of dinner' function <i>E(y,z) =
5(30-y-z) - (y-10)^2 + z^3</i> <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/dinner.pdf">plotted for you as
contours</a>. Our search for a maximum
actually found the critical point <i>y = 15/2, z = sqrt(5/3)</i> shown
as an "x" on the diagram. You can see it is a saddle-point (you can test this).
The true maximum is at the top corner,
where the contours become so densely packed because of the <i>z^3</i> term.
<li>Little <a href="http://www.math.neu.edu/undergrad/calc4eng/q7/multipliers_why.html">page</a> on why Lagrange multipliers work, and <a href="http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~hom/calculus/Lagrangef/lagrange.html">practise problems

here)

(Part of complete online <a href="http://www.maths.mq.edu.au/~wchen/lnmvafolder/lnmva.html">course</a> similar to ours, bit more theoretical).
<li>Errors in solutions to HW6: 15.8.4 the max and min are 26 and -26,
not 22 as I had.
16.1.4 I flipped the limits on x and y: the technique is the same, and the
true answer -11.
<li>Errors in solutions to HW7: 16.4.2: inner integral limits are <i>y=0</i>
to <i>y=2-x</i>. Of course if you do it as Type II that's equally good.

on cylindrical and spherical
integration.
<li>HW9 will be postponed by 1 week, until April 16. Therefore there will
only be 11 HWs. The lowest 2 will still be dropped.

<b>PS</b>
You will be pleased to know my research in <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/phys.html">physics</a>
and <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/talks/am02.pdf">medical imaging</a> relies heavily
on partial derivatives (in the form of partial differential equations)
and almost every other aspect of this course. I am not special - almost
any practicing scientist would say the same. So... keep studying - it's useful!
