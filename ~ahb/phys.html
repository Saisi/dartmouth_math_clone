<b><font color="#445121"><font size=+1>
M</font>y work involves the
<a href="http://www-wilson.ucsd.edu/education/pchem/qm">quantum
mechanics</a> of non-interacting particles trapped in a <a
href="http://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/jdm/faq-%5B2%5D.html#Heading12">
classically-chaotic</a>
cavity, or `billiard', with hard walls. The problem is identical to that
of the wave motion of an elastic sheet stretched across a drum-head. It
is very important to find the eigenstates (vibrational modes) and how they
change when the cavity is deformed - for instance, how large can a deformation
be before the states are scrambled? Computationally it is hard, even in
only two dimensions, to find states with high quantum numbers (up to a million
states above the ground state) - some of
my research has been developing efficient methods for this. As well as
being a paradigm for
<a href="http://sagar.physics.neu.edu/qchaos/qc.html">quantum
chaos</a> (the study of quantum mechanics in chaotic systems), such hard-walled
systems can model `<a href="http://marcuslab.harvard.edu/research.html">quantum
dots</a>' (2D electron gases in semiconductor microstructures), nucleon
motion in a deformed nucleus (3D fermion gas), light trapped in chaotic
optical fibers ...any system governed by the Helmholtz equation.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#445121">If the cavity slowly changes shape, the particles
can be heated in an irreversible manner due to random energy exchange with
the moving walls - this dissipation happens in both quantum and classical
mechanics. In work with Doron Cohen, we have discovered the fact that deformations
which preserve shape have vanishing heating rates, and this led us to improve
the `wall formula' estimate for heating rate. The dilation deformation
case turns out to be crucial to the operation of an efficient numerical
eigenstate method too.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#445121">I also study open systems: the conductance
of electron or matter waves through arbitrary potential structures, for
instance a <a href="http://meso.deas.harvard.edu/spm.html">quantum
point contact</a> coupled to an open resonant cavity. A scattering theorist's
approach provides many insights which complement the traditional transmission
matrix recipe (Landauer formula).</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#445121">I have also designed and simulated a new neutral
atom waveguide, which uses the evanescent light field above a submicron
dielectric optical guide. This design is ideal for the exciting experimental
field of atom optics</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#445121">`on a chip' (substrate). This also involved
numerical 2D eigenstate calculations - vector electromagnetic waves rather
than scalar waves.</font></b>

PARAMETER-DEPENDENT DEFORMATION OF CHAOTIC QUANTUM BILLARDS</font></b></h3>
<font color="#445121">A single particle trapped inside certain hard-walled
cavities, in which the classical motion is chaotic, has been a prototype
system for studying `quantum chaos' in the last 20 years.</font>
<p><font color="#445121">The rate of change of the hamiltonian with respect
to a certain deformation of the billiard boundary forms a matrix <i>M</i>
when written in the undeformed eigenbasis. The <i>band profile</i> (mean
square matrix element as a function of distance away from the diagonal)
of <i>M</i> has physical significance: it tells you the dissipation coefficient
under periodic time-depenedent `driving' of the boundary, in the linear
response regime (classically, and when this is a valid regime, quantum-mechanically
too, see <a href="http://monsoon.harvard.edu/~doron/#frc">this</a>).&nbsp;
Also the local density of avoided crossings (for 1 deformation parameter),
and diabolical points (degeneracies in the spectrum for 2 or more parameters),
are directly related to the limit of the band profile close to the diagonal.
I hope to extend the work of Berry, Wilkinson and Austin on diabolical
points in real billiard systems (as opposed to random matrices). Note that
avoided crossings also are a mechanism for (quantum) dissipation - however
an entirely different one than linear response mentioned above.</font>
<p><font color="#445121">Above I show <i>M</i> in the case of the deformation
being <i>dilation</i>. Contrast this with M for a `generic', <i>ie</i>
non-special, deformation (a wiggle along the boundary), shown <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/images/wave2.Msquared.gif">here</a>.
(Both data are for the quarter stadium billiard, for all 451 eigenstates
in the wavevector range 398 &lt; k &lt; 402). The special property that
for dilation, the mean square matrix element vanishes as you approach the
diagonal has been called <b><i>quasi-orthogonality</i></b>. It is the key
to the method of Vergini &amp; Saraceno (see below). Using a technique
of Mario Feinberg, the mean square element can be estimated semiclassically,
using a long classical trajectory. We have found that the special cases
of dilation and translation have a 4th power law, and rotation a 2nd power
law, for the mean square element as a function of distance from the diagonal.
This result applies to a generic billiard - we see deviations from these
power laws (or possibly very slow convergence) in the stadium billiard,
we believe due to neutrally-stable orbits causing long-time correlations.</font>

`WALL FORMULA' FOR DISSIPATION RATE OF A DRIVEN CHAOTIC BILLIARD</font></b></h3>
We consider the response of a chaotic cavity in d dimensions to periodic
driving.&nbsp; We are motivated by older studies of one-body dissipation
in nuclei, and also by anticipated mesoscopic applications.&nbsp; For calculating
the rate of energy absorption due to time-dependent deformation of the
confining potential, we introduce an improved version of the wall formula.
Our formulation takes into account that a special class of deformations
causes no heating in the zero-frequency limit.&nbsp; We also derive a mesoscopic
version of the Drude formula, and explain that it can be regarded as a
special example of our calculations.&nbsp; Specifically we consider a quantum
dot driven by electro-motive force which is induced by a time-dependent
homogeneous magnetic field.

&amp; SARACENO METHOD FOR DIAGONALIZING QUANTUM BILLARDS</font></b></h3>
A little-known and little-appreciated solution to
the long-standing awkwardness and unreliability of calculating chaotic
billiard eigenstates was invented recently (described very briefly in E.
Vergini and M. Saraceno, <i>Phys. Rev. E</i> <b>51</b>, 2204 (1995) ).
This method finds the cluster of <i>all states</i> in a classically-small
<i>k</i>
(wavevector) range (roughly 0.2/<i>R</i>, where <i>R</i> is the maximum
billiard radius), so is about 1000 times faster than `sweeping' methods
(which search for minima of a singular value or determinant as a function
of <i>k</i> - the common Heller's tension method and Boundary Integral
Method fall into this category), at typical <i>k </i>of a few hundred.
Moreover, the relative efficiency <i>increases</i> linearly with
<i>k </i>!
<p>I am working to extend Vergini's analysis of the
errors in this method, which arise from 2 causes: <b>1</b>) the inability
of the <b>basis</b> to represent general solutions to the Helmholtz equation
at a single k value (without requiring exponentially large coefficients),
and <b>2</b>) the deviation of the <b>dilation</b> matrix <i>M</i> from
the identity (<i>M</i> is the matrix studied <a href="phys.html#dil">above</a>).
Vergini has made tremendous progress in creating a seemingly asymptotically-complete
basis set for the stadium billard - I am working on extending this to more
general shapes (using the three components: real plane waves, evanescent
plane waves, and Neumann-type Bessel functions), with <b>Natasha Lepore</b>.
The deviation of <i>M</i> from identity is responsible for the <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/images/vergini_tens_6th_pwr.ps">sixth-power
growth of tension errors</a>, also found by Vergini, however, how this
power-law arises is under investigation.

session (350kb .ps)</a> aimed towards the proposed <i>Center for Ultracold
Atoms</i> (Harvard / MIT / Wellesley).
<p>In brief, I implemented a non-uniform finite element
solution for the full vector bound modes of a submicron dielectric optical
waveguide, to assess its potential as an evanescent-field atom trap. For
simplicity a rectangular guide was chosen, and the optimal trap design
was found in the parameter space of height and width, under the constraint
that the guide remain optically `single-mode' (ie one vertically and one
horizontally polarized bound mode). By feeding red- and blue-detuned light
down the guide with these 2 orthogonal polarizations, a stable potential
minimum is felt by the atoms, due to the near-resonant dipole force. Trapped
in the xy plane, they are free to travel in the z axis, and the device
can operate in both incoherent and coherent regimes.

<p>I have also worked on a new refractive index structure
for high-power single-mode erbium-doped fiber laser designs which allow
large mode area, with Mara Prentiss. This requires creating refractive-index

- two conflicting requirements.

POINT CONTACT MAXIMUM CONDUCTANCE, CROSS SECTION AND SCATTERING IN THE
HALF-PLANE</h3>
I model conductance through a general 2DEG constriction
(`Quantum Point Contact'), for instance in the presence of a nearby curved
resonator "mirror" (a structure under study in the experiments of the Westervelt
group here at Harvard). The existence of such a resonator allows the conductance
to reach a single <i>conductance quantum </i>(e^2/h per spin) through an
arbitrarily small hole! If many resonances overlap, the conductance can
theoretically exceed this (unlikely to be experimentally observed, since
the resonances are extremely narrow). Based on the continual stream of
ideas from <b>Rick Heller</b>, and with early input on 2D scattering theory
from <b>Adam Lupu-Sax</b>, I developed an alternative to the `lead' and
`reservoir' picture (Landauer formula for the relation of conductance to
transmission matrix elements between `lead' states), which involves scattering
cross section in the infinite half-plane. Conductance is equal to the angular
integral of the transmission cross section, divided by the de Broglie wavelength.
The requirement of a <i>thermal occupation of incoming waves</i> for conductance
quantization emerges naturally.
<p>A new radial basis set of partial-wave type states
in the half-plane is appropriate to problems where usual `leads' cannot
be defined (<i>eg</i> there are nearby scattering objects in the reservoirs,
or the QPC is highly non-adiabatic). I develop this basis, and show it
behaves just like usual transverse lead states as far as Landauer is concerned.
It is also possible to express incident plane-waves in this basis, making
connection with the cross section viewpoint. Furthermore, it furnishes
scattering-theorists' analogies: a small hole in a wall is shown to be
dominated by p-wave scattering and transmission. The p-wave transmission
coefficient is found analytically using matching to the Laplace (<i>k</i>=0)
solution local to the hole.
<p>`Conductance' quantization of atom waves through
a QPC has been recently proposed as an experiment by <b>Joseph Thywissen</b>
of the Prentiss Group (now moving to Paris). I show that reciprocity of
conductance (left-to-right = right-to-left) need not hold in such an atomic
system, because there need not be a thermal occupation of incoming waves
(the angular distribution may not be uniform).
