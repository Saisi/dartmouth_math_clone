Real part of full field due to an
incident plane wave (in direction shown by arrow)
hitting an infinite array of dielectrics of index n=1.5, in TM polarization,
with a period of roughly 8 wavelengths. Three periods are shown.
<p>
The computation was done to 14 digit accuracy on a laptop
in a time of 2.6 secs to solve for the coefficients,
and 47 secs to evaluate the field on a grid of 30000 points.
The <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/qpsc_demo.m">code</a> to do this using the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/mpspack"><code>MPSpack</code></a>
toolbox for MATLAB is 12 lines long.
<p>
Notice the focusing by the obstacle, and the
strong wave traveling along the grating.

We present a new method for periodic scattering problems using
2nd kind boundary integral equations and
the free-space Green's function, adding extra degrees of freedom
on the unit cell walls, and imposing quasi-periodicity in an
expanded linear system.
This avoids the problems with the standard approach, namely:
the quasi-periodic Green's function is slow to evaluate,
it diverges at Wood's anomalies, and it does not handle large aspect
ratios well. Our new approach cures all three issues, and can easily
be `wrapped' around an existing code (e.g. fast-multipole acceleration)
for the isolated-obstacle scattering problem.

Here is the <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/papers/qpsc.pdf">preprint</a> for the 2D case,
submitted Aug 2010, which will
appear in <i>BIT Numerical Mathematics</i> for their 50th anniversary issue.

Here are some movies:

<li>
<a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/talks/w10_anglemovie_cont.mpg">contour</a> for the
Sommerfeld integrals, moving as a function of incident angle.
The contour deforms to stay away from poles
in the integrand, and corrects for this analytically.

<a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/talks/w10_anglemovie.mpg">scattered field</a>, moving
as a function of incident angle.
Note the `kinks' as Wood's anomalies are passed;
these are real and not numerical artifacts.

related band structure paper in J. Comput. Phys.
