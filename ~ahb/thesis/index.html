<p>This page is my attempt to pass on something useful from what I learned
during my not-so-recent thesis completion, in October 2000. I hope it may save
some of you from pain and late-night LaTeX formatting nightmares.
<p>Notice that the Harvard GSAS format is only necessary for the bound
(Archives) copy of the thesis, and its associated unbound (boxed) copy,
both of which are submitted to the Registar's Office. Copies for your research
group, copies for your departmental library (in my case Physics Research
Library), personal copies, etc, <b>need not follow this format</b>, and
will certainly look more professional if you play with the format (see
below).
<h4>
HARVARD GSAS FORMAT</h4>
In January 2000 the Harvard University GSAS format was updated. The new
`Form of the Doctoral Thesis' handbook is available online <a href="http://www.gsas.harvard.edu/academic/studentaffairs/thesis.html">here.</a>
As well as the two people it lists to contact at Pusey library (whose expertees
lie mainly with the physical requirements), I found the <b>Registrar's
Office</b> (<b>5-1519</b>, I spoke to <b>Lauren Lemire</b> but there may
be others there who can help) most useful. It seems some issues with the
new format are being ironed out and it is best to ask.
<p>One of the crucial things I learned from her was the <b>preferred font
size: 12pt Times New Roman</b>. So put away that ruler and stop counting
average characters per inch (CPI) - this is an outdated specification (thankfully).
Also the new format of the Abstract is not crucial: as long as you have
the new information (your name, advisor's name, thesis title) on the page
somewhere then it's fine. I have updated the .cls file to include a <b>new
Abstract format</b> that I designed. The page-numbering in the front matter
is also not crucial, she told me; as long as arabic-numbered pages start
at 1 on the first page of Chapter 1, then this is fine (for instance, my
style file below does not put iii on the first page of the Abstract, but
does put iv on the second, etc).
<h4>
LATEX2e STYLE CLASS</h4>
Here is <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/thesis/huthesis.cls">huthesis.cls</a> (version 1.4, Sep 2007),
which I modified from Adam Lupu-Sax's port from UCTHESIS (from students
at University of California). It has correct margin spacing, handles single-
and double-sided, has my updated Abstract format (including correct headering
of multi-page Abstracts), correct page numbering (roman in frontmatter,
arabic in main body - however not all frontmatter pages are of a format
where a number appears on that page), and has three different spacing options:
\ssp (1.0 single spaced), \hsp (1.37 "one and a half"-spaced), and \dsp
(1.8 "double"-spaced). Harvard GSAS requires "double"-spacing for the Abstract,
Acknowledments, main body of the text, etc. But true 2.0 double-spacing
is so horrendous (in my opinion) that you wouldn't want to use it. Besides,
1.8 allows you to cram in that all-important extra line or two per page.
You could easily change the spacing options by editing this .cls file.
This style file also uses the fancy-header package <b>fancyhdr.sty</b>
which I believe is standard with current LaTeX distributions.
<p>You will also need the font specification files: <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/thesis/hut10.clo">hut10.clo</a>,
<a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/thesis/hut11.clo">hut11.clo</a>,
<a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/thesis/hut12.clo">hut12.clo</a>,
depending on which font size you use (remember 10pt is <i>smaller</i> than
12pt). I found that for my own thesis copies, 11pt was more appropriate
than the almost childishly-large 12pt required for Harvard.
<p>Also you might want to read <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/thesis/ucthesis.readme">ucthesis.readme</a>
which is a description of the features of the original style file. I found
that 'draft' mode was not so good as simply using \ssp at the beginning
of the document.
<p>To get you going, you can latex my <b>thesis skeleton</b>, get that
working, then inject your content and play around. You will need:
<blockquote><a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/thesis/thesis.tex">thesis.tex</a>
(main file: chooses packages, gives order of chapters and appendices)
<br><a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/thesis/frontmatter.tex">frontmatter.tex</a>
(abstract, acknowledments, citations to published work, dedication, etc)
<br><a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/thesis/mathdefs.tex">mathdefs.tex</a>
(I include in case you find any of my equation abbreviations in there useful
- certainly the \be and \ee save your wrists. It also includes a semi-workable
version of the APS <b>mathletters macro</b> which allows you to number
blocks of equations 3a,3b, etc... however the referencing of these equation numbers still has
errors! Let me know if you solve this one.)
<br><a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/thesis/ch1.tex">ch1.tex</a>
(my actual chapter 1 - includes references to other chapters which will
not be resolved [appear as ??])
<br><a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/thesis/ap1.tex">ap1.tex</a>
(dummy appendix A)
<br><a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/thesis/fig1.eps">fig1.eps</a>
(example Encapsulated PostScript figure used in appendix A)
<br><a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/thesis/b.tex">b.tex</a>
(wrapper for bibliography)
<br><a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/thesis/bibs.bib">bibs.bib</a>
(actual bibliography - in BibTeX format)</blockquote>
<i>The whole package (huthesis.cls, hut*.clo, ucthesis.readme, and my skeleton)
can be downloaded here as a <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/thesis/huthesis_pack.tar.gz">gzipped
tar file</a>.</i>
<p>You will need to ensure that the huthesis.cls and hut*.clo files are
accessible in a directory which is included on your TEXINPUTS environment
variable, so latex can find them. Then simply execute the command '<b>latex
thesis</b>', and you will get a prompt asking which files you want to process.
Type eg 'frontmatter,ch1' to latex those two sections, or any combination
of chapters and appendices separated by commas. This feature really saves
some time while editing single chapters. Enter 'all' to latex the whole
thing. This should run without errors, and give the .dvi file. As usual
you will need to rerun it, and run 'bibtex thesis' at the appropriate times.
(For latex info see <a href="http://www.giss.nasa.gov/latex/">here</a>, 
<a href="http://wol.ra.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/latex_demo/Welcome.html">here</a>,
<a href="http://www.ma.man.ac.uk/~higham/latex.html">here</a>
and <a href="http://home.eunet.no/~shoiset/latex/digest.html#manualdelimetersize">here</a>,
etc. and the usual books.) I included (using epsfig) an example <b>figure</b>
placed using the float package.
<p>Also maybe relevant is a Harvard <a href="http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/toolkit/scidoc/Mythesis/Mythesis.html">thesis.cls
page</a>, which I did not find useful at all (it seems to have vanished anyway).
<h4>
YOUR OWN FORMAT</h4>
I suggest for you own copies of the thesis: changing to 11pt font, \ssp
or \hsp spacing, and double-sided pages. This looks a lot more like a professional
publication and less like a draft of a children's book. You may also want
to experiment with altering the definitions of figure caption environments
in huthesis.cls, to have smaller text in these captions (\smallssp etc).
Note that there is a complication with double-sided pages, namely that
the 'parity' (physics term for whether the page is odd [wide left margin]
or even [wide right margin]) is determined from the page number. Therefore
if your frontmatter has an odd number of pages, the parity will be incorrect
when the page counter is reset to 1 at the beginning of Chapter 1. To correct
this, you will need to add an extra blank page in the frontmatter, probably
after the dedication is best. My resulting thesis is downloadable as gzipped
postscript (2.6Mb) <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/thesis/thesis.ps.gz">here</a>.
