<p>Here's my tips for putting your Latex'ed thesis
<a href="../thesis_html/index.html">online</a>.
Now that <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> can search PDF files,
there is less urgency to do this,
but I like having it online, and I'm your sure
potential collaborators would like it too...
I'm assuming a Harvard-style document (<i>i.e.</i> using <i>huthesis.cls</i>;
see <a href="index.html">
my page on this</a>), but most of what I say applies to any
custom thesis style.

<p><font color="#BB00BB">Keep in mind that it is a least a day's work
(at least it was for me, with all the debugging below). More if you
want it perfect.</font>


<h3>HOW TO DO IT (rough guide):</h3>

<ul>

<li>Back up thesis. Make a new version (<i>eg thesis_html.tex</i> etc)
which is in regular \documentclass[11pt]{book} form.
Cut out table of contents.
Add 'Chapter 1: ', 'Appendix A: ', etc at start of
\chapter{} arguments for each chapter and appendix.
(Here you have to do the counting by hand: it's clumsy).

<li>Cut out all huthesis.cls special things: reorganise frontmatter
into a separate chapter. (reset the chapter counter after this so your
chapters don't get numbers offset). Put each frontmatter piece as a
regular section{} rather than the huthesis.cls environments.
Build title-page by hand within the \author{} and \date{} commands
(clumsy).

<li>Make sure compiles with regular latex. Do so 3 times for correct refs.

<li>Change the bibilography to be \input{thesis.bbl} if you used BibTeX,
rather
than the call to bibs.bib. This hack gives you a regular book-style
bibliography so latex2html can handle it.

<li>Make sure you have a recent version of <a
href="http://www-texdev.mpce.mq.edu.au/l2h/docs/manual/">latex2html</a>.
Version 2k.1 seems to come with recent linux dists.

<li>Check your version of netpbm library via <b>rpm -qa | grep netpbm</b>
(if you're on Linux).
If 9.11 or less, either update (see <a
href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/">sourceforge distribution</a>)
or make yourself a new patched verion of pstoimg script as
described in <a href="http://webhost.math.rochester.edu/webworkdocs/discuss/msgReader$390?mode=topic">Ross Moore's black border
fix</a>.

<li>Copy the icons directory in your latex2html distribution to
your public_html directory (they must be accessible from outside world!)

<li>Use following .latex2html_init in local directory:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# Force white background and black text
$BODYTEXT = "text=\"\#000000\" bgcolor=\"\#FFFFFF\"";
# This ensures that some figures do not end up with a grey background
$WHITE_BACKGROUND = 1;
# Tell LATEX:
$LATEX_COLOR = "\\pagecolor{white}";

$PSTOIMG = "$PERL /home/barnett/lib/pstoimg";

# use GIF rather than PNG:
$IMAGE_TYPE  = $IMAGE_TYPES[1];


$ICONSERVER = "http://monsoon.harvard.edu/~barnett/icons";

1;      # This must be the last line
</pre>
</blockquote>
Note that you only need the $PSTOIMG line if you made your own patched
version of pstoimg, in which case have it point to wherever you put your
version.
The $ICONSERVER line points to where you put your icons directory.

<li>Run latex2html on a paired-down document (eg all but 1 chapter
removed) first.

<li>My final top-level document:
<a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/thesis/thesis_html.tex">thesis_html.tex</a>
(cf original <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/thesis/thesis.tex">thesis.tex</a>.
My final frontmatter: <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/thesis/frontmatter_html.tex">frontmatter_html.tex</a>
(cf original <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/thesis/frontmatter.tex">frontmatter.tex</a>.


<li>My command line: <pre>
latex2html -white -antialias -image_type gif -html_version 3.2 thesis_html
</pre>
This creates (or modifies) the directory thesis_html

<li>If not all inline images or equations appear in final HTML form,
scan though <b>images.log</b> file generated in the output directory.
Most likely latex got stuck in a loop and died, failing to produce the
remaining .ps images. You may need to alter your math latex code
until it works. I needed to remove \mathletters calls altogether.
<font color="#BB0000">Anyone got any help on \mathletters
(less buggy version)?</font>


<li>Move the resulting directory into your public_html directory.
The resulting size was only a few Mb, much less than the
(uncompressed) PostScript version, about the same as in PDF.
The entrance URL is then thesis_html/index.html

</ul>
