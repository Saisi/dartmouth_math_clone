<h2>Random Plane Waves</h2>
<h4>Alex H. Barnett</h4>
</center>

<p>
What does a typical (generalized) eigenfunction
of the laplacian in the unbounded domain R<sup>2</sup>, 
<i>ie</i> 2D free space, look like?
Say we choose the eigenvalue 1, then the complex plane wave
<i>e<sup>i<b>n.x</b></sup></i>, with <b>n</b> is a unit direction vector,
is an eigenfunction, but is not typical.
A typical sample from the eigenspace with eigenvalue 1
can be constructed by a superposition of such waves
traveling in all directions, with random complex phases.
In other words, it is the 2D Fourier transform of Gaussian white noise
restricted to the unit circle <i>S<sup>1</sup></i>.
Berry first proposed this as a model for quantum eigenfunctions
of systems whose classical dynamics is chaotic, in the '70s.

<p>This was one of the topics addressed at the recent
AIM Workshop on <i><a 
href="http://www.aimath.org/ARCC/workshops/randomsets.html">Topological 
complexity of random 
sets</a></i> (Aug 2009).
Here is my <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/AIMworkshop_contrib.pdf">contribution</a> to the 
workshop, and some data generated there is below.

<p>
Here are some pictures of samples of random plane waves, showing the
real part, chosen with mean-square value 1, computed with the code
linked below. Click on each to magnify:

<p>One might study the local box-counting (Kolmogorov) <b>fractal 
dimension</b> of 
the extreme-value sets via the
slope of the log-log plot of the number of boxes vs box size. <a 
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/f2048_100_NvsE.eps">Here</a> is
such a plot (different curves are for the different extreme value 
cut-offs), compared to the <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/g2048_100_NvsE.eps">same for
a spatially-uncorrelated model</a>. They are similar but the stringiness
of the level-set shows up as a slight slope in the region before
the asymptotic slope of 2 is reached.

Here is Matlab function to produce the above pictures:
<a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/rpw2dsample.m"><code>rpw2dsample.m</code></a> which needs codes
<a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/circle_blobs.m"><code>circle_blobs.m</code></a> and <a 
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/src.m"><code>src.m</code></a>.
See the Matlab help for documentation and example usage.
The code is spectrally accurate (with default parameter <code>e=5</code>
it has absolute errors of order 3e-4), and uses the nonuniform FFT
by resampling onto a uniform square grid.
With <code>n=1024</code> it takes of order 5 sec on my laptop for
all computations, using about 400MB RAM.
Time scales like <code>n^2 log n</code> and memory use like
<code>n^2</code>; both these are optimal.

<p> For larger computations the windowed NUFFT becomes a RAM-hog and
crude slow-FT summation wins out if you have CPU cycles to burn.
Here's a code for that: <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/naiverpw.m"><code>naiverpw.m</code></a>.
The result is super-large plane-wave samples, such as the following
extreme-value set downsampled from 7000x7000 pixels, 2000 
wavelengths across (click to magnify):

<p>mean Radon projection of (bottom-left quarter of) f<sup>2</sup>

<p>Notice how the Radon projection seems to have isolated bright
spots (or bowties), as you'd expect for intense lines in coordinate 
space.
It is an open problem how to prove something statistical
which quantifies the `stringiness' visible to the eye in the above 
pictures and movies. One question is why the Radon, or Gaussian
beam, basis, leads to apparent sparsity of coefficients.

when the wavenumbers are allowed to vary in magnitude, the
stringiness disappears.

This seems not to be relevant since the functions do not live

How about random plane waves on a sphere? This really means a random
Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunction from within a degenerate eigenspace of
large eigenvalue, or a random sum of spherical harmonics of constant degree.
