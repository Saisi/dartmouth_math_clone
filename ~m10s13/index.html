<i>OpenIntro Statistics</i>, 2nd edition, by David Diez, Christopher Barr, and Mine &#x00C7;etinkaya-Rundel. <br />
The book is available for free online <a href="http://www.openintro.org/stat/">here</a>, or it can be purchased in paper form for under $10. </p>

<b>Suggested additional reading:</b> <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i> by Daniel Kahneman. This book consists, at least in part, of a collection of errors in statistical thinking that people make. 
<p>Additional readings will be made available on the Schedule.  We will discuss some of these as they arise naturally in the discussion of statistics.
<br />

<p><table bgcolor="#7397b0" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2" width="100%"><tbody><tr><th align="left"><a name="homework"></a>Homework</th></tr></tbody></table></p>


<p> Homework assignments will be due on Mondays. Assignments will typically consist of several problems from the textbook and will be made available here. Homeworks are to be handed in before class on the day they are due.   In general, late homework will not be accepted for a grade, and never without prior arrangement. 
<p> Please fill out a <a href="ferpa.pdf">FERPA form</a> if you would like to get your homework handed back in a box. (Outside of your classroom in Kemeny.  Otherwise, you have to come to your instructor's office and present an ID in order to get it back.) 

<p> Homework assignments will be graded much as the problems on your exams will be graded, that is the graders will be looking at the work which supports your answer even more than the answer itself. In particular, a correct answer with no justification will receive no credit, whereas mostly correct work and a tiny error may receive a substantial amount of credit. Solutions should be written in an organized and legible manner. The purpose here is to prepare you for how your exams will be graded. 

<p><table bgcolor="#7397b0" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2" width="100%"><tbody><tr><th align="left"><a name="homework"></a>Labs</th></tr></tbody></table></p>
Statistics is most useful when applied to large datasets, which is only practicle when using a computer.  In order to apply statistics it is thus necessary to have knowledge of a statisical software package.  
The labs will be used to give you hands on experience with one particular software package, the freely available, programming language R. The labs will also provide you with tools you will need to complete the project successfully.

<p> We will go through parts of <a href="http://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php">these labs</a> during the x-hours. You will then be asked to do answer some questions related to the lab.  If you are unable to finish the lab during the x-hour it will need to be finished on your own (or during Tutorial that evening) and will be due by the beginning of class the next day.

<p><table bgcolor="#7397b0" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2" width="100%"><tbody><tr><th align="left"><a name="homework"></a>Project</th></tr></tbody></table></p>

<p>There will be one project involving doing hypothesis testing about a question involving a large data set. You will find a large data set of your choosing, which should be freely available online, and you will ask a question about it.
<p> <a href = "m10project.pdf">Click here for details about the project.</a> A project proposal is due on April 26th, and the final paper is due on May 24th.</p>

to come for assistance with homeworks and labs. We have one teaching assistant, Jeffery Hein.</p>

We encourage any students with disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities such as chronic diseases and learning disabilities, to discuss appropriate accommodations with your instructor, which might help you with this class, either after class or during office hours. Dartmouth College has an active program to help students with disabilities, and we are happy to do whatever we can to help out, as appropriate.

<p> Any student with a documented disability requiring academic adjustments or accommodations is requested to speak with their instructor by the end of the second week of the term. All discussions will remain confidential, although the Academic Skills Center may be consulted to verify the documentation of the disability and advise on an appropriate response to the need. It is important, however, that you talk to us soon, so that we can make whatever arrangements might be needed in a timely fashion.

<p> Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with us before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.

<p>For your convenience, here is the <a style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);" href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/calendar/term/2013-03.html">term calendar</a> as set by the registrar, with deadlines for schedule adjustment and other significant dates.</p>


<p><table bgcolor="#7397b0" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2" width="100%"><tbody><tr><th align="left"><a name="homework"></a>Honor Principle</th></tr></tbody></table></p>
<p><b>On Exams</b>: No assistance may be given or received except that
you may ask the instructor for clarification of a problem. You may and should, however, use calculators. You are also allowed one 4"x6" index card of notes; you can write anything you want on the index card.</p>
<p><b>On Homework</b>: You are permitted and encouraged to collaborate
with other students on the
homework. However, after discussing the problems, you must write up the final
solutions in your own words. You may use calculators and approved
software. Additionally, you may consult your class notes
and text. It is a violation of the honor code for someone to provide
the answers for you.</p>

<p><table bgcolor="#7397b0" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2" width="100%"><tbody><tr><th align="left"><a name="homework"></a>Grading</th></tr></tbody></table></p>
<p>Grades will be assigned based on homework, labs, the project, and exams. Homework will count for 20% of the course grade, labs for 10%, the project 20%, the midterm 20%, and the final 30%. </p>
