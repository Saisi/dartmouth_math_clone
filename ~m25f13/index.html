Math 25</span> &nbsp;Number
theory is possibly the oldest branch of mathematics. As such it serves
as some of the inspiration for much of the mathematics we now consider
"modern", such as abstract algebra (math 31, 71, 81), real and complex
analysis&nbsp; (math 63 and 43), as well as touching most other
branches of mathematics. &nbsp;As a course with few prerequisites, the
goal of Math 25 is to give students practice in proving theorems and
writing those proofs well. &nbsp;This practice will serve you well when
you take more advanced courses. &nbsp;The small project is intended to
give you a chance to learn independently by reading more technical
literature and presenting it in your own words and on a poster.
&nbsp;You will be encouraged to present your work at the spring poster
session hosted by the Math Department.</big><br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Grading:</span> Grades (out of
500) are based on two midterms (100 each), the final exam (150), weekly
homework (100 total, 20 each), and a small project (50) with write-up
and poster.</big><br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attendance:</span>
This
quarter we meet T-Th 10-11:50 and Wed 3-4. &nbsp;We spend class time
on many examples and case studies not included in the text. We will frequently use
the
Wednesday time slot to participate in a research seminar in
mathematical biology (timed this way just for you). &nbsp;Students from
Math 23 (Differential equations) may also attend and participate in the
seminar, as well as students engaged in independent study in
mathematical biology. &nbsp;Attendance at the x-hour is required of
Math 27 students when we use it, and of Math 4 students on certain days (to
be announced). &nbsp;Do not schedule other activities during this time.</big><br>

Honor principle: </span>(This prose was modified from Shemankse's 2010 course page) </big><br>
<br>
<big>On Homework and the project: Students are encouraged to work
together to do homework problems. What is important is a student's
eventual understanding of homework problems, and not how that is
achieved. The honor principle applies to homework in the following way.
What a student turns in as a homework solution is to be his or her own
understanding of how to do the problem. Students must state what
sources they have consulted, with whom they have collaborated, and from
whom they have received help. Students are who rely on solutions to
problems that are posted on the web must reference them with the URL.
The solutions you submit must be written by you alone. Any copying
(electronic or otherwise) of another person's solutions, in whole or in
part, is a violation of the Honor Code.</big><br>
<br>
<big>Moreover, if in working with someone they have provided you with
an important idea or approach, they should be explicitly given credit
in your writeup. Hints I give in office hours need not be cited. Note:
It is not sufficient to annotate your paper with a phrase like ``I
worked with Joe on all the problems.'' Individual ideas are to be
credited at each instance; they represent intellectual property.</big><br>
<br>
<big>On Exams: Students may not receive assistance of any kind from any
source (living, published, electronic, etc), except the professor, and
may not give assistance to anyone. Matters of clarification are to be
left to the professor.</big><br>
<br>
<big>If you have any questions as to whether some action would be
acceptable under the Academic Honor Code, please speak to me, and I
will be glad to help clarify things. It is always easier to ask
beforehand. S.</big><br>




<br>
<big><b>Disabilities, religious observances, other accomodation as needed</b>: &nbsp;(This prose was modified from Shemankse's 2010 course page) </big><br>
<big>I encourage any students with disabilities, including "invisible"
disabilities such as chronic diseases and learning disabilities, to
discuss appropriate accommodations with me, which might help you with
this class, either after class or during office hours. Dartmouth
College has an active program to help students with disabilities, and I
am happy to do whatever I can to help out, as appropriate.<br>
<br>
Any student with a documented disability requiring academic adjustments
or accommodations is requested to speak with me by the end of the
second week of the term. All discussions will remain confidential,
although the Academic Skills Center may be consulted to verify the
documentation of the disability and advise on an appropriate response
to the need. It is important, however, that you talk to me soon, so
that I can make whatever arrangements might be needed in a timely
fashion.<br>
<br>
Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur
during this academic term. If you have a religious observance that
conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me
before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate
accommodations. &nbsp;The same goes for anything that might interfere
with coming to class (e.g. sports trips).
