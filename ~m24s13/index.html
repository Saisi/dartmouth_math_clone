<p><font size="+1"><b>General Comments on the Course: 
</b></font>
<p>Linear algebra is a branch of modern algebra in which the theory of vector spaces, linear transformations (functions between vector spaces), and matrices are studied. The emphasis is on abstraction and the main methods consist of definitions, theorems and their proofs, and examples. Since this is usually the first mathematics course in which proofs are central, it is important for students to understand the logical progression of a proof and to be able to prove simple results on their own. In addition to being a part of pure mathematics, linear algebra has applications in many areas, including but not limited to mathematics, physical and biological sciences, and economics.</p>

<ul>  
<li>On Homework: Students are encouraged to work together with one or two classmates and/or to seek help.   What is important in doing homework is the eventual comprehension of the solution of the problem. 
When a student writes up a homework problem it is to be his or her own understanding of how to solve the problem. The solutions that a student submits must be written by him or her alone. Any copying of another person's solutions will be regarded as a violation of the Honor Code.</i> <br></li>
