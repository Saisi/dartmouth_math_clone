         Class is over and grades are in (all P's for the grad students); everyone passed, and, more importantly, everyone
	ended up with a paper worth posting.  I have posted them below, alphabetically by author.  Enjoy.  And nice going, everyone!!

		  <td> <h3> <a name="abstract">Abstract</a></h3>
		  <td>
			<p style="text-align : justify">  When a token moves randomly from vertex
			to vertex via the edges of a graph, it is taking a random walk.  This simple
			process is as useful as it is elegant, with multiple analogies in electrical
			networks and applications to the theory of computing.  There have been
			remarkable new advances in this classical subject and we will spend
			much time with recent work and unsolved problems.  </p>

                        <p><em>Prerequisites:</em> Basic probability (e.g., Math 20 or 60), and the
                          mathematical sophistication of a beginning graduate student, an advanced
                          undergraduate mathematics major, or a theory-oriented CS major.
