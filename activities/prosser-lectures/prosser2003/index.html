	<p align="left">What caused hundreds of Japanese children 
          to fall into seizures while watching an episode of the cartoon show 
          Pokemon? Why do women roommates sometimes find that their menstrual 
          periods occur in sync? The tendency to synchronize is one of the most 
          mysterious and pervasive drives in all of nature. Every night along 
          the tidal rivers of Malaysia, thousands of fireflies flash in silent, 
          hypnotic unison; the moon spins in perfect resonance with its orbit 
          around the Earth; the intense coherence of a laser comes from trillions 
          of atoms pulsing together. All these astonishing feats of synchrony 
          occur spontaneously -- almost as if the universe had an overwhelming 
          desire for order.On the surface, these phenomena might seem unrelated. 
          After all, the forces that synchronize fireflies have nothing to do 
          with those in a laser. But at a deeper level, they are all connected 
          by the same mathematical theme: self-organization, the spontaneous emergence 
          of order out of chaos.</p>
