<p align="left"><font size="+1">Abstract: In the decades surrounding the French 
  Revolution, French citizens and royalty faced a multitude of risks, from sexually 
  transmitted disease to decapitation. But just how risk-adverse were the Robespierres 
  of that era? And how did the sans-culottes lose their culottes? An unusual data 
  source on the French Lottery provides a window on how financial risk was addressed 
  in that tumultuous time. The story sheds light upon how the emerging calculus 
  of probabilities affected the perception of risk, and how this understanding 
  interacted with political events. An unusually diverse cast of characters is 
  involved, including Casanova, d'Alembert, and Bonaparte, as well as some modern 
  statistical technique. </font></p>
