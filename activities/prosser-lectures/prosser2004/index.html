	<p align="left">Thanks to various processes of digitization,
	it is now possible to bring computational analysis to bear on
	works of art, be they literature, visual arts, or even
	dance. In this talk, we'll explore some of these analytic
	techniques and show how mathematicians and computer scientists
	have been able to use mathematical tools to quantify artistic
	style.</p>
