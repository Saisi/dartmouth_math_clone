<p><b>Textbook:</b> Linear Algebra, Third Edition, by Larry Smith (Springer), available at Wheelock Books.</p>

<p><b>Students with disabilities</b> enrolled in this course and who may need disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to see me privately as early as possible in the term. Students requiring disability-related accommodations must register with the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~accessibility/">Student Accessibility Service</a> office. Once SAS has authorized accommodations, students must show the originally signed SAS Accommodations/Consent Form and/or a letter on SAS letterhead to me. As a first step, if students have questions about whether they qualify to receive accommodations, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions about accommodations will remain confidential.</p>

<p>For your convenience, here is the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/calendars/term/2012-01.html">term calendar</a> as set by the registrar, with deadlines for schedule adjustment and other significant dates.</p>

<h2>About the Course</h2>

<p>Linear algebra is a fundamental area of mathematics, the study of vector spaces and linear transformations.  These simply-defined objects appear in many disparate fields both within and outside mathematics, and you have seen them already (not by name) in calculus.  We will study them primarily in the abstract, with the second goal of learning how to work abstractly and read and write proofs.  Math 22 and 24 share these goals, but in 24 we will work in more generality and go a little further than we would in 22.</p>


<h2>Lectures and Exams</h2>

<p>Lectures will be held Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, 10:00-11:05, and x-hours of all but the first week and week of the midterm, Thursdays at 12:00-12:50.  All are in Kemeny 108.</p>

<p>There will be three scheduled quizzes held during class, one midterm held out of class time, and the final exam.</p>

<h2>Homework and Tutorials</h2>

<p><b>Homework</b> will be largely from the book and will be a combination of computational and conceptual work.  One of the points of both 22 and 24 is to learn how to read and write proofs, so they will be a significant component of the written work.</p>

<p><b>Tutorials</b> are an additional resource for you to get help with the course.  Similarly to office hours, they are times set aside for you to come for assistance with material.  Our teaching assistant is Emma Chiapetta.</p>

<p>Through the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/tutors/index.html">Academic Skills Center</a> you may join a study group or obtain a private tutor.</p>


<h2>The Honor Principle</h2>

<p><b>On Exams and Quizzes</b>: No assistance may be given or received except that you may ask the instructor for clarification of a problem.  In particular, no calculators or computing devices may be used.</p>

<p><b>On Homework</b>: Collaboration and discussion is encouraged, and you may discuss problems with instructors, tutors, and fellow students, and use notes, books, calculators, and computing devices.  However, each student is to complete his or her assignments individually and independently.</p>


<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>The quizzes, homework, and exams will be weighted as follows.</p>
