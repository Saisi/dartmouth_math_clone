  <h2>Textbook</h2>

  <p>James Stewart, <span style="font-style: italic">Calculus</span>, 7th edition, Brooks-Cole. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?isbn=0538497815">ISBN 0538497815</a></p>

  <p>The course will cover chapters 7, 11, 12, 13, and 14.</p>

  <p>The textbook is available from <a href="http://www.wheelockbooks.com">Wheelock Books</a> (in limited quantity) and in various formats from online resellers.</p>

  <h2>Exams</h2>

  <p>There are three exams for Math 8: two midterms and a final.</p>
  <table class="info" width="100%">
    <tr>
      <th>Exam 1</th>

    </tr>
  </table>
  <p style="text-align: center"><strong>If you have a conflict with an exam,<br />inform your instructor as soon as possible!</strong></p>

  <h2>Homework</h2>

  <p>The main course homework is online through the free system WeBWorK. You will receive an email message with your login information at the beginning of the quarter. For additional information about WeBWorK, see the <a href="https://webwork.dartmouth.edu/webwork-local/docs/students_FAQ.html">WeBWorK FAQ</a>.</p>

  <p>WeBWorK requires precise syntax. You have unlimited tries on each problem, so if you are certain you have done the problem correctly, check your parentheses and other syntax, and keep numbers inside square roots and other operations instead of using rounded-off decimal answers. Here is a quick refrence guide for <a href="https://webwork.dartmouth.edu/webwork-local/docs/available_functions.html">mathematical notation in WeBWorK</a>.</p>

  <p>In addition to WeBWorK, you will regularly be assigned discussion problems. You will then be invited to discuss these problems with a small group of your peers for 15 minutes during an x-hour. You must have a tentative solution to each problem in order to participate in the discussion.</p>

  <h2>Grades</h2>

  <p>Your course grade will be the largest of the following two computations:</p>

  <table class="info" width="100%">
    <colgroup>
    <col width="30%" />
    <col width="35%" />
    <col width="35%" />
    </colgroup>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <th align="center">Option A</th>
      <th align="center">Option B</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>WeBWorK</th>
      <td align="center">15%</td>
      <td align="center">15%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Discussions</th>
      <td align="center">15%</td>
      <td align="center">15%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Exam 1</th>
      <td align="center">20%</td>
      <td align="center">15%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Exam 2</th>
      <td align="center">20%</td>
      <td align="center">15%</td>
    </tr>    
    <tr>
      <th>Final</th>
      <td align="center">30%</td>
      <td align="center">40%</td>
    </tr>      
  </table>

  <p>Option A will be selected if your performance on the final exam is worse than the average of your performance on the two midterm exams. In that case, your mishap on the final will be curbed by the fact that it counts for less relative to the two midterms.</p>

  <p>Option B will be selected if your performance on the final exam is better than the average of your performance on the two midterm exams. In that case your improvement for the final will be amplified by the fact that it counts for more relative to the two midterms.</p>

  <p>There will be no opportunities for extra credit. Unexcused late or missing homework and exams count zero.</p>

  <h2>Tutorials</h2>

  <p>Tutorials are an additional resource for you to get help with the course. Similarly to office hours, they are times set aside for you to come for assistance with material.</p>
  
  <p>Our three teaching assistants this quarter are Katherine Moore, Hallie Glickman-Hoch and Sean Griffin.
  Tutorials are held every Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday evening from 7:00 to 9:00 in Kemeny 007, except on exam days.</p>

  <h2>Honor Principle</h2>

  <p>In Math 8, the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~uja/honor/">Academic Honor Principle</a> is interpreted as follows.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>For Exams:</dt>
    <dd>No assistance may be given or received. No calculators or other computing devices may be used.</dd>
    <dt>For WeBWorK:</dt>
    <dd>Collaboration and discussion is encouraged, and you may discuss problems with instructors, tutors, and fellow students, and use notes, books, calculators, and computing devices. However, you must enter your answer on your own and you must make sure that you understand the solution that led you to this answer.</dd>
    <dt>For Discussions:</dt>
    <dd>Collaboration and discussion is encouraged, and you may discuss problems with instructors, tutors, and fellow students, and use notes, books, calculators, and computing devices. However, you must compose your answer on your own using your own words.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>Students with questions about the application of the honor principle in a specific case should seek advice from their instructor.</p>

  <h2>Disabilities</h2>

  <p>Students with disabilities of any nature who are enrolled in this course are encouraged to discuss these matters with their instructor privately as early as possible. All such discussions will remain strictly confidential.</p>

  <p>Students requiring disability-related accommodations should contact the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~accessibility/">Student Accessibility Service</a> (SAS) office. The SAS office will then contact your instructor to make any special arrangements you require.</p>

  <h2>Tutors and Study Groups</h2>
  
  <p>In addition to office hours and tutorials, the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/">Academic Skills Center</a> offers private tutors and study groups through the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/tutors/index.html">Tutor Clearinghouse</a>.</p>
