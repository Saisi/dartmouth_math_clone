<p align="center"><b><font size="5">MA29: Introduction to Recursion Theory<br>
  </font></b><b><font size="5">Spring 2002 </font></b></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Course Description</b>: This course is an introduction to recursion theory, 
  also known as computability theory, a dynamic area of contemporary research 
  with consequences for the foundations of mathematics, and for theoretical computer 
  science.<br>
  <br>
  Recursion theory is concerned with the nature and structure of computable functions, 
  i.e. those functions whose output can be determined by a finitary program. (A 
  program taking finitely more machine space than we currently command is computable, 
  while a program that requires infinite capacity is not). In class, we will formalize 
  several notions of computability, and consider their relationship to each other. 
  We will discuss Church's Thesis, which equates these formalizations with intuitive 
  notions of computability. Then we will examine functions which are, and are 
  not, computable. Some functions are not computable by any means whatsoever; 
  this is linked to incompleteness phenomena via the Halting Problem.<br>
  <br>
  We will then study selected topics from among: relative computability, degrees 
  of unsolvability, and recursive sets, as time permits.This schedule corresponds 
  to covering chapters 1-7 of the text, with selections from the remaining chapters, 
  as time and class interest mandate.</p>
