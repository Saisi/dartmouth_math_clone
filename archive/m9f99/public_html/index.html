<h2>Math 9 (Calculus) - Fall 1999</h2>
<hr>
<b>Final Exam:</b> Sunday, December 5, 1999 from 4:00-6:00 p.m. in Bradley 101
<p>
Officially, tutorials end when classes end, so the last tutorial is Tuesday, November 30.  However,
out of the goodness of their hearts, Barry and Earl have agreed to have a review session from 3:00
to 6:00 p.m. on Saturday the 4th in Bradley 101.

<p>
<b>Maple</b>:  We will be using the software package <i>Maple</i> from
time to time.  If you are not familiar with Maple, <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/software">here is some
information</a> to get you started.  Click on the appropriate Maple
information page.
<p>
<b>Tutorials</b>: The tutors for Math 9 this term are Barry Balof (<a href="mailto:Barry.A.Balof@dartmouth.edu">Barry.A.Balof@dartmouth.edu</a>)
and Earl Crawford (<a
href="mailto:Earl.M.Crawford@dartmouth.edu">Earl.M.Crawford@dartmouth.edu</a>).
There will be tutorials every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday evening
from 7:00 to 9:30 in Bradley 104.  If no students are present by 9:00,
the tutors may leave.
<p>
<b>Grade</b>: Your grade will be determined as follows:
<PRE>
Category                 Weight         
----------------------------------     
homework and quizzes      15%            
2 mid-term exams          25% each      
final exam                35%                                                  </PRE>   
<p>
<b>Exams</b>: There will be two midterm exams and a final.  The first
mid-term is October 18. The date and time of the
2nd midterm and the final have yet to be
determined.  
<p>
<b>Makeup policy</b>: Homework will be assigned (almost) every class
period, and will be due at the next class meeting.  <i>No late
homework will be accepted for any reason</i>, but your three lowest
homework scores will be dropped before computing your grade.  Thus you
may miss up to three homework assignments without penalty.
<p>
Makeup tests will only be given in case of legitimate emergencies.  
<p>
<b>Honor policy</b>:
Collaboration is encouraged during the process of
thinking about homework problems, but is not acceptable while writing
up your final solutions.  That is, working together on homework is
fine, but copying is not.  
<p>
No collaboration of any form is acceptable during exams.
<p>
<b>Students with disabilities</b>:  We encourage students with
disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases
and learning disabilities, to discuss with their instructor any
appropriate accommodations that might be helpful.
