<h3>
Exams</h3>

<p><br>There will be 1 midterm exam and a cumulative final exam. The exams
will be take-home
<br>exams. You may not consult with anyone but me on either part of an
exam. You will be able
<br>to use your book and notes on the exams unless it explicitly says otherwise.
Tentative dates
<br>for the midterm exams are as follows.

<p>We will work out a schedule for the exams during the first week of class.
The final exam
<br>period goes from December 2 through December, so If you must make travel
plans before
<br>the exam date is set, do not make plans to leave Hanover before December
7.&nbsp; Exams will not
<br>be given early to accommodate travel plans.

<h3>
Homework Policy</h3>
There will be homework assignments due each day. You may (you are encouraged
to) work together on the homework assignments. However, the work you turn
in should be your own.&nbsp; This means that after whatever
<br>discussions you have about the problems, you should write up your own
solutions in your own words. If you work with someone else from the class,
please list their names at the top of your assignment.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h3>
Grades</h3>
The exams, homework, and final exam all count equally toward your grade.

<h3>
Disabilities</h3>
I encourage students with disabilities (of any kind; including ``invisible''
disabilities like chronic diseases,
<br>learning disabilities, or psychiatric disabilities) to discuss with
me after class or during my office hours
<br>appropriate accomodations that might be helpful.&nbsp; Students with
disabilities who will be taking this course
<br>and may need disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged
to make an appointment to see
<br>their instructor as soon as possible.&nbsp; Also, they should stop
by the Academic Skills Center in Collis Center to register for support
services.
