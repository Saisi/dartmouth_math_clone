<hr size="2" width="100%">
<div align="left">We want to cover as much of chapters 1 through 6 (and
possibly 8) of the
text as we can in 9 1/3 weeks. &nbsp;We'll begin with a study of
complex
numbers themselves and their basic properties. &nbsp; Then we'll
initiate a study of the calculus
of functions of a single complex variable, and then investigate
a few of the so-called elementary analytic functions which we're all
familar
with from our science courses.<br>
<br>
In the second part of the course, we'll look at the properties of
analytic
functions which are connected to line integrals. &nbsp;We'll try to
develop
enough theory to prove that an analyic function (that is, a
differentiable
function on an open set of the complex plane) is not only infinitly
differentiable,
but is actually given by a convergent power series. &nbsp;To do this,
we'll
need to develop some notions in topology and analysis. &nbsp;In
particular,
we'll need to review and learn more about power series
themselves.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
After completing the second part of the course, we want to develop some
applications
to evaluating improper (real) integrals. &nbsp;This will require the
residue
theory of Chapter 6. &nbsp;We'll cover as much of Chapters 6 and 8 as
we
can, with some additional topics if time permits.<br>
