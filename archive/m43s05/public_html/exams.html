anyone report any typos or should clarifications be necessary, they
will be posted <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m43s05/exam-clarifications.pdf">here</a>. You have to
turn it in to my office between 10:30am and 11:30am on Saturday
morning, June 4th.&nbsp; I will not impose any time restrictions, but<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> I hope that nobody
will spend more than 4 hours on it.</span>&nbsp; (I will write it as if
you were taking a three hour "in class" exam.)&nbsp; The exam will be
closed book and closed notes.&nbsp; (You can think of it as a
"take-home in class exam".)&nbsp; I will have office hours on Thursday,
but <span style="font-weight: bold;">once you download the exam, you
can only ask for clarification of the meaning of a question on the exam</span>.
&nbsp; It is an honor code violation to do otherwise.&nbsp; The exam
will cover everything we've talked about this term.&nbsp; As always in
mathematics courses, the emphasis will be material covered later in the
course and in particular on material not covered on previous exams.</span><br>

second exam will be returned on Monday, May 23rd.&nbsp; </span>I wrote
a letter grade on each exam which reflects an approximation of your
grade in the course to date.&nbsp; It reflects your scores on the first
two exams and a score out of 100 on the homework scores <span
 style="font-style: italic;">through assignment 14</span>.&nbsp; I
strongly recommend that you study my <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m43s05/exam2-solns.pdf">solutions
to the second exam</a>.&nbsp; You can
also see a hist-o-gram of the s<a href="exam2-dist.pdf">cores on the
second exam</a> and the converted <a href="hw-dist.pdf">homework scores</a>&nbsp;

view some solutions I wrote up.&nbsp; Please notice that it does not
take all that much effort to give complete resaons.&nbsp; Notice also
that the solutions consist of complete sentences and paragraphs where
appropriate.&nbsp; Some statistics and a hist-o-gram for the first exam

 style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A
comment about grades</span>.&nbsp;
In an advanced course like Math 43, the median grade is usually either
a B+ or an A-.&nbsp; Exactly where the median falls will vary from
class to class depending on the absolute performance of the
students.&nbsp; I put grades on the exams to give students a general
idea of where they stand.&nbsp; A such grade should only be considered
a rough estimate.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A comment about marking of
exams.&nbsp;</span> I am always willing to discuss the grading of
exams.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">As a matter of
good sense and courtesy, I expect you to have looked at the solutions
provided above before you come to see me</span>.&nbsp; But. if you
don't understand why points were taken off, it is important that you
ask so that you can avoid losing points in the future.&nbsp; It is even
possible that the points may have been deducted in error.&nbsp; It is
more likely that I couldn't read or understand your reasoning -- or
that you omitted your reasoning altogether.&nbsp; I hold the take home
work to a higher standard than the in class work.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-style: italic;">But in either case, there is little excuse
for incomplete sentences and/or work that is difficult to follow.</span><br>
