<hr>

<p>There are two kinds of problems listed.  The non-mandatory "warm-up" is problems you can try first if you're uncomfortable with the material or just want more practice; their answers are in the back of the book (as are all the odd-numbered problems' answers), and they will be assumed material on exams.  Then there are the problems for handing in, which will be graded for credit.</p>

<p>Feel free to discuss the problems with each other and with me, but your write-up must be your own.  Please do not hand in warm-up problems, but you are welcome to discuss them with me.</p>
