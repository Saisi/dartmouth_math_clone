<br>






















Homework will be assigned daily and collected on Wednesdays. &nbsp;<br>






















<br>






















You should attempt and do your best to complete the homework that goes with a given lecture before the next lecture.<br>






















<br>




















If you need additional practice, there are hints and/or answers to the
odd numbered problems in the back of the book. &nbsp;(I may assign odd
numbered problems anyway, if I think they are important.)<br>






















<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">HOMEWORK 1: Due Wednesday, September 29th.<br>






















<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Wednesday Sept. 22nd:</span><br>






















<small><small><big><big><br>






















Read: Chapter 1 and the first two pages of Chapter 2.<br>






















Do: Chapter 1: 2, 3, 12<br>






















Bring your completed survey to class on Friday.<br>



















<br>



















<span style="font-style: italic;">Friday, Sept. 24th:<br>



















<br>



















</span>Look at the sample starred problem, which is a solution to
problem 14 in Chapter 2. &nbsp;Decide whether you would give me credit
or no credit for my proof. &nbsp;We'll discuss this in class on Monday.<br>



















Read the rest of chapter 2.<br>



















Do: Chapter 2: 8, 20,&nbsp;26* (first starred problem!), 28, 36<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">HOMEWORK 2: Due Wednesday, October 6th.<br>


















<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Monday, Sept. 27th:<br>


















<br>


















</span>Read: Chapter 3. &nbsp;There is one problem (19) about centers
and centralizers, which we will not discuss in class, so you should
read pages 63-64 carefully. &nbsp;You don't need to read about subgroup
tests, but you might want to glance at the theorems so that you know
they exist.<br>


















Do: Chapter 3: 2, 4, 10, 19 (this is in the back of the book, but your solution
should contain extra detail so that I can tell you've thought about it
and understand it), 40<br>


















<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><small><small><big><big>
<br>




















<span style="font-style: italic;">Wednesday, Sept. 29th:<br>

















<br>

















</span>Read: Chapter 4. &nbsp;For now, just pay attention to the
statements of the theorems. &nbsp;We examined these theorems for the
case of Z_n in class, and next time, we'll talk about how to rewrite
our observations so that they look more like the theorems in the book.<br>

















Do: Chapter 4: 4, 10, 12, 16, 40 (note the group is Z, the set of integers, and not Z_n)<br>
















<br>
















<span style="font-style: italic;">Friday, Oct. 1st:<br>
















<br>
















</span>Read: Chapter 4.<br>
















Do: Chapter 4: 42*, 62<br>















</big></big></small></small>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Monday, October 4th:</span><br>















<br>















Read: Chapter 5 (We'll do cycle notation on Wednesday, so you can wait until Wednesday to read that if you want).<br>















Do: Chapter 5: 10, 17, 31, 34, 36. &nbsp;For odd numbered problems,
your answer should contain more detail than the answer in the back of
the book.<br>














<br>














<span style="font-style: italic;">Wednesday, October 6th:<br>














<br>














</span>Read: The rest of chapter 5 (p. 108-9 are optional).<br>

new starred problem, there is extra credit (see the worksheet).<br>

appearance on the midterm, and you will (as usual) be allowed to ask me
about these problems in office hours, even after the midterm starts.</span><br>
