<h2>WeBWorK and Math 2</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
  <p></p>
  <h3> I. What is WeBWorK ? </h3>
  <em>WeBWorK</em> is a system that allows students to do their
homework
in an interactive web-based environment. <br>
  <br>
Using <em>WeBWorK</em>, students may try to answer homework problems
more than once. After each try, a message appears telling the student
whether the answer is correct or not. This provides immediate
feedback to the students, allows them to discover what they did wrong,
and hopefully allows them to understand the topic of the question
better. <br>
  <br>
Each <em>WeBWorK</em> problem set is individualized. Each student has
a different version of a problem generated from a fixed template; for
example the numerical values in the formulas may be slightly
different).
  <p></p>
  <h3> II. How anybody can try out WeBWorK</h3>
  <p>Anyone with an internet connection can try out WeBWorK by
following
the directions in Part III below and using the <strong>Guest Login</strong>
button at the bottom of the login page.</p>
  <p></p>
  <h3> III. How to use WeBWorK to do your homework</h3>
  <p> Using <em>WeBWorK</em> is quite simple.<br>
Below are the basic steps on how to get started.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> Most pages of <em>WeBWorK</em> also contain
directions. Therefore, if you are ever unsure of what you should do,
try reading the directions and descriptions on the page at which you
are looking.<br>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>You can use any computer with a browser like Mozilla, Firefox,
Netscape, Safari, or MSIE. A note of caution is the IE on the Mac has
some issues with secure pages, so should be avoided for use with
WeBWorK. </li>
    <li>Open your browser and go to the main <em>WeBWorK</em> page,
address<!--a href="http://webwork.math.rochester.edu/"--> <a
 href="https://webwork.dartmouth.edu/webwork2">https://webwork.dartmouth.edu/webwork2</a>.
    </li>
    <li>On that page you will see names of current <em>WeBWorK</em>
courses. Find the name of your course and click on it. </li>
    <li>This will get you to the main page of your course. This page
includes necessary information about logging in.<br>
To log in, enter your login name and password, and click on the
'Continue' button.<br>
Your <strong>login name</strong> is the usually just your last name,
followed possibly by a digit for people in the class with the same last
name (e.g. smith, smith2, ...)). Possible exceptions include compound
last name like "den Hartog" or "De La Huerta" which would be rendered
Hartog and Huerta respectively. <br>
Your initial <strong>password</strong> is (unless you gave me
something else) your six-character student ID ``number''. </li>
    <li>If your login is incorrect, you will be told so, and you can
return to the login page and try again. </li>
    <li>If you are registered for the course, you should receive an
email from your instructor confirming your login and password prior to
the first day of classes. <br>
If your login is correct you will see a page where you can do
following:
      <ul type="">
        <li><strong>Change your password and email address</strong><br>
You should probably change your password since it initially set to
your student ID number which is relatively sensitive data. You should <b>not</b>
make it your BlitzMail password unless you always
use a
secure connection (https) and don't typically login on public
computers to do your homework. If you forget your password, it can be
reset, but perhaps not for 24 hours.<br>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Look at and do the problems in a homework set.</strong><br>
To do the first day's assignment, for example, click on the line in the
box that starts with 'setf05day1'. <br>
Each line listing the homework sets will indicate whether the set is
open or closed. If the set is open, that means that when you solve a
problem, it will be counted towards your grade. If the set is closed,
you can still solve problems, but your results will not be recorded. <br>
After the indication of whether the set is open or closed, there is
additional information about the due date (if the set is open), or
whether the answers are available (if the set is closed).
<!-- 
When the answers are available, you have the option of
  looking at correct answers when viewing a problem.
-->
        </li>
        <li><strong>Get a printout of the problem set.</strong><br>
Most likely you will want to print a hardcopy of your problem set so
that you can think about the problems and work out the solutions before
you sit down at the computer to enter your answers. To print out
setf05day1, for example, select the button next to its listing and
click on the <b>download hardcopy button</b>. This will take you to a
new page where you can tweak things and then press the <b>Generate
hardcopy</b> button. You will need a pdf reader (e.g. Acrobat Reader)
to view the file, but most of you should have that already.
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Look at a summary of your WeBWorK homework scores.</strong><br>
If you click on the button 'Grades', you will see your current scores
for all available problem sets. Generally there is no additional
information. </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>If you are printing out a problem set or looking at a summary
of your homework scores, you are done. If you are viewing a problem set
via your web browser, you will see a page with the problems in the set
you chose. To view and/or answer a problem. Notice that there are
various modes of viewing the problem: 'plainText', 'formattedText' and
'images', and so on. It is best to view the problem using 'images'
mode. Enter your answers and click on the 'Preview Answer' or 'Submit
Answer' button.
      <p>The <b>Preview Answer</b> is extremely useful to verify the
expression
you have entered is what you really intended. The <b>sample</b> set
is one in which you can practice entering expressions.<br>
If you are working on a problem set that is already closed, you will
have the option to see the correct answer or a solution if one is
available (currently only a few problems have solutions available). To
see the correct answer and/or solution, just check the box(es) and
click on the 'Submit Answer' button (you do not have to enter an answer
to see the correct answer or solution). Once you have submitted an
answer, you will be told whether your answer is correct or not. If not,
you can try again. After you've tried a problem, you can either go to
the next problem, the previous problem, or see the list of the problems
again. </p>
    </li>
    <li>If you want to check the status of your problems (e.g. to
double check that your answers have been recorded), use the "Prob.
List" button at the top of the page to see the problem list page. </li>
    <li> When you are finished, log out using the "Logout" button on
the left side of the page. </li>
    <li>That's all, folks! </li>
  </ol>
  <h3> IV. Important facts to know </h3>
  <p> </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What to do if you have problems with WeBWorK:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li>If you have a problem logging in, contact your instructor. </li>
        <li>If you have a problem printing out a set, ask a consultant
at a computer lab. If you don't get sufficient help, contact your
instructor or TA. </li>
        <li>If you have questions on specific homework problems or if
you have comments about <em>WeBWorK</em> that you think can help us
make <em>WeBWorK</em> better, click on the 'Feedback' button on any of
the pages of <em>WeBWorK</em>. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If you are logged on to <em>WeBWorK</em> for longer that 30
minutes without any activity, you will be asked to log in again. This
is a security measure. You can resume your work after you logged back
in. All your results from the last login will be saved. </li>
  </ul>
