Textbook</h3>

<blockquote><i>Introduction to Probability</i>
<br>(Second Revised Edition)
<br>by Charles M. Grinstead and J. Laurie Snell</blockquote>
This book makes frequent references to programs that are available on the
web. I'll be using the Maple
<br>versions, but they are also available for Mathematica and TrueBASIC.
You can find all of them at <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/book.html">http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/book.html</a>

<h3>
Exams</h3>
There will be 1 midterm exams and a cumulative final exam.&nbsp;&nbsp;
You may not consult with
<br>anyone but me on either part of an exam. You will not be able to use
your book, notes or
<br>calculator on the exams unless it explicitly says so on the exam .
Tentative dates for the
<br>midterm exams are as follows.

<p>The Registrar's Office schedules the final exam, which will occur during
the period
<br>December&nbsp; 6 --10. If you must make travel plans before the schedule
for final exams appears,
<br>do not make plans to leave Hanover before December 11.&nbsp; Exams
will not be given early to
<br>accommodate travel plans.

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h3>
Homework Policy</h3>
There will be homework assignments due each week.&nbsp; There may also
be a few
<br>longer homework assignments, distributed periodically during the term,
which
<br>you will have one or two weeks to complete.&nbsp; Homework will be
graded out of
<br>10 points, and you will receive an automtic five points for making
an attempt at
<br>all the problems.&nbsp; Late homework is eligible only for the automatic
5 points.&nbsp; If
<br>you have a valid reason for turning in homework late (such as illness
or a family
<br>emergency) please talk to me.&nbsp; Your lowest two homework grades
will be dropped
<br>before computing your end-of-term average.
<p>You may (you are encouraged to) work&nbsp; together on the homework
assignments.
<br>However, the work you turn in should be your own. This means that after
whatever
<br>discussions you have about the problems, you should write up your own
solutions in
<br>your own words. If you work with someone else from the class, please
list their
<br>names at the top of your assignment.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h3>
Grades</h3>
The midterm will count for 35%, the final will count for 40%, and the
<br>homework will count for 25% of your final grade.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h3>
The Honor Principle</h3>
Every student who matriculates at Dartmouth agrees to abide by the academic
<br>honor principle.&nbsp; You have an obligation to act with integrity
in your own
<br>academic work, and to take action if you observe honor code violations
by
<br>others.&nbsp; Academic integrity is essential to the scholarly enterprise
and we take
<br>it seriously.
<p>In Math 20, you are encouraged to work together on homework problems,
<br>and to use professors, other students, other textbooks, and generally
any
<br>resource you can find that will help you understand and work the problems.
<br>You must write up the homework solutions by&nbsp; yourself in your
own words.
<br>In brief, collaborate but don't copy.
<p>You must do all work on exams independently, without giving or receiving
<br>assistance of any kind.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h3>
Special Concerns</h3>
Please talk to me as soon as possible, or whenever something comes up,
about
<br>any special concerns you have about the class.&nbsp; If you have a
disability and may
<br>require disability-related accommodations, talk to me as soon as possible;
this
<br>includes invisible disabilities like chronic diseases, learning disabilities,
and
<br>psychiatric disabilities.&nbsp; If you have athletic or other extracurricular
commitments
<br>and hope to accommodate them (for example, by taking midterms at alternative
<br>times), talk to me.&nbsp; If you are ill and fall behind on work, talk
to me.&nbsp; If you are in
<br>any way concerned about the course or your performance in it, talk
to me.
<br>If you can't do the homework, talk to me. Make an appointment, either
after class,
<br>by phone or via blitzmail, if you can't make regular office hours.
