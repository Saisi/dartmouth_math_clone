<H2>Reading</H2>

<P>
We will meet during our X-Hour on November 2!

<BR>
This week, we're going to start working on Chapter 15 (really!),
so we'll be learning about vector fields and line integrals.
Try to have 15.1 and 15.3 read by Monday, and read through
15.4 for Friday.
<BR>
If you feel up to it, reading 15.5 is a great idea.
</P>
