<H2>Reading</H2>

<P>
Class is cancelled for Wednesday, October 27 and October 29.

This week, we're going to start working on Chapter 15,
so we'll be learning about vector fields and line integrals.
Try to have 15.1 and 15.3 read by Monday, and read through
15.4 for Friday.

If you feel up to it, reading 15.5 is a great idea.

In actuality, we only got up to the point of being able to 
start Chapter 15.  So this all got shifted to next week.

</P>
