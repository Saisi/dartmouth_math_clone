There will be 2 midterm exams and a cumulative final exam.
The exams will have two parts: an hour long in-class part
and a take-home part.  You may not consult with anyone but
me on either part of an exam. 
You will not be able to use your book, notes or
calculator on the exams unless it explicitly says so 
<B> on the exam </B>. Tentative dates for the midterm
exams are as follows.
There will be two Mid-term examinations and a final examination. The Mid-term
exams are scheduled as follows:

<A NAME="hw"></A>Homework Policy
</H3>

There will be homework assignments due each day.
You may (you are encouraged to) work 
together on the homework assignments.  However, the work
you turn in should be your own.  This means that after 
whatever discussions you have about the problems, you
should write up your own solutions in your own words. If 
you work with someone else from the class, please list 
their names at the top of your assignment.


<HR>
<H3>
<A NAME="grades"></A>Grades</H3>

The exams, homework, and final exam all count equally toward
your grade.

I encourage students with disabilities (of any kind; including
``invisible'' disabilities like chronic diseases, learning 
disabilities, or psychiatric disabilities) to discuss with me 
after class or during my office hours appropriate accomodations
that might be helpful.

<P>
Students with disabilities who will be taking this course and may need
disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an
appointment to see their instructor as soon as possible. Also, they
should stop by the
