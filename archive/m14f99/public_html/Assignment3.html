<H2>Reading</H2>

<P>
We should get through 11.1, 11.2, 11.4 by 
Monday.  Look through 11.3, even though we won't
cover it before the exam.  One of the problems
I assigned for 11.4 uses a definition from
11.3.

We'll meet during the X-Hour on Tuesday, October 12.
Depending on how things are going, we'll review either
on Tuesday or Wednesday.  The first Mid-Term exam is
on Friday!

If you turn in homework on Tuesday, you'll get it back 
on Wednesday.  If you turn it in on Wednesday, you 
should come to office hours on Thrusday to retrieve it.
</P>
