Approximately 1 inch margins with 12 point font is good.  (I'm not going tomeasure, but I will have trouble reading a smaller font.)  Make sure your name appears on each page.

Asthere is no class on this day, the assignment is due in my office, 104 Choate House, by 4 PM.  <p>If you think you may want to submit later papers electronically, please submit this assignment <b> both </b>electronically and in hard copy.  My computer is fairly old at this point, and can't always read others' files.  Itis not safe to submit an assignment in electronic format only until we've verified that it will work.<p>Assignment:  Write a short essay, about one page, comparing and/or contrasting mathematical proof with proof ineveryday life.<p><!-- separator --><table bgcolor=#7397b0 border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left><A NAME="one"></a>Paper One</th></table><p><!-- statement -->Your first term paper is to be an essay about a philosphical topic connected with the concept of infinity.  You maypick a topic from the list below or choose one of your own.  If you choose yourown topic be sure to consult with me to make sure it is appropriate. Recommended length, 5-8 pages. <p><table bgcolor=#9db1c0 border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left>Topics</th></table><p>1.  State the positions of Achilles and the Tortoise in Carroll's article.  Choose one ofthe two responses in our reader (or another one of the responses from the October 1995 issueof <i>Mind</i>) and reconstruct the argument.  Some questions you might address:  How doesthe article respond; whose side (if any) is it taking; what does it point out as important tounderstanding what is going on in the Carroll article?  Do you agree?  What do you think welearned about arguments from Carroll?  (Do not choose this topic unless you feel you havesomething to say beyond simply repeating the arguments of the articles you discuss.)<p>2.  Given that no one really agrees with Zeno's conclusion, how would you argue with him?  What kind of evidence would you use --- mathematical, physical, intuitive, logical?  Sketchout an approach and say why you think your evidence is legitimate or convincing.  (I amthinking of Achilles and the tortoise, but you can respond to any one of Zeno's paradoxes fromthe Salmon article.)<p>3.  What exactly is fishy (if anything) about proof by mathematical induction?  Would itwork if you were trying to show, e.g., that all swans are white?  (The first swan I see iswhite; whenever I see a white swan, the one sitting next to it is also white...)  Why orwhy not?  If not, why doesn't this affect (mathematical) proofs by mathematical induction? <p>4.  Discuss my "proof" by mathematical induction that no amount of coffee is enough towake me up in the morning.  Is this a paradox?  If so, how would you classify it (usingQuine's categories), and why?  Can you explain the paradox?  Can you come to any conclusionabout when proof by mathematical induction is appropriate and when it is not?  <p>The next topics require reading ahead:<p>5.  Pick a big problem (global warming? well, maybe that's too big) and use Descartes'smethod on it.  See how far you get, and say at what point you get stuck.  In what ways isthe method limited?<p>6.  The title of Descartes's paper refers to "seeking truth in the sciences."  How would amodern scientist describe his or her method of seeking truth?  Is it different fromDescartes's method?  If so, what are their relative strengths and weaknesses in light of theassurances we want from a method of seeking scientific truth?  Is there another area (humannature, religion, morality) in which you think we should use a different method for seekingtruth?  Why, and what properties should it have?<p><table bgcolor=#9db1c0 border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left>Grading</th></table><p>The grade for your first paper will be based on how well it meets these criteria:<p>(1.)  Paper has something to say.<p>You don't have to have an ambitious goal like solving Zeno's paradox once and for all, but you shouldhave something in particular to communicate.  A good test is to see whether you can write a sentence ortwo summarizing what your paper has to say.  It should look something like, "My paper argues that Zeno'sparadox still has the status of an antinomy," or "My paper explains how Achilles can answer the tortoiseusing modern physics," rather than, "`My paper is about mathematical induction."<p>(2.)  Examples and arguments support the points being made.<p>A particular note here:  Claims about the nature of reality or the validity of empiricism or ...imported from your outside knowledge of philosphy need to be argued and supported to convince the reader."Obviously, we don't need to discuss the existence of things we cannot perceive with ourphysical senses," doesn't do the job.  Another note:  Be careful, especially in yourintroduction and conclusion, to avoid the temptation to make sweeping claims (especially ifyou're not sure you can support them) in order to make your paper seem significant.<p>(3.)  Language is used precisely and correctly.<p>This is extremely important when discussing philosophy, as shown by the care with which Moore explainsAristotle's use of the word "untraversable."  Be especially careful with words that have specialimportance for our discussions.  As an example, you can't "prove infinity" any more thanyou can "prove New Hampshire;" as another, Zeno's paradox (a paradox being, as Quinedefined it, an apparently absurd conclusion with an argument to sustain it) "exists,"because Zeno stated that argument and conclusion and we can read what he said, regardless ofwhat you conclude about its paradoxical nature.<p>(4.)  Explanations are clear, and are understandable with no special background beyond thiscourse.<p>(5.) Paper is well-organized, with a clear theme and a logical flow of ideas throughout.<p>(6.)  Writing style is good, both clear and graceful.<p>Watch especially for using words, phrases, and sentence structures that are unnecessarily complex andpompous.<p>(7.)  Technical details of spelling, grammar, citations, etc. are correct.<p>In connection with both this point and the previous one, I recommend <i>The Elements of Style</i> byStrunk and White.<p><!-- separator --><table bgcolor=#7397b0 border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left><A NAME="two"></a>Paper Two</th></table><p><!-- statement -->In class last week, we worked together to solve some math problems using the method of infinitesimals.<p>For this paper, you are to present and explain a solution to one of these problems using infinitesimals.  You may usethe problem you were assigned, and which you and your team solved, or you may use any of the other problems on thelist.<p>In order to explain you may want to use:  A discussion of the method of infinitesimals.  Pictures or diagrams.  Adescription of a physical situation corresponding to the problem.  A graph or collection of graphs.  Examplesof special cases  (e.g., particular values of the variables), and discussionof the important features of those cases.<p> Your paper may have any format you want.  You may write a straightforward math paper, a dialogue, an essay, or even ascience fiction story, as long as the focus of your paper is solving a math problem.<p><table bgcolor=#9db1c0 border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left>Grading</th></table><p>The grade for your second paper will be based on how well it meets these criteria:<p>(1.)  Problem is solved correctly, using the method of infinitesimals.<p>(2.)  Explanations are clear and understandaable by a college student who has never studied calculus.<p>(3.)  Other material (examples, graphs, anecdotes, etc.) helps in understanding the problem and its solution.<p>(4.) Paper is well-organized, with a clear theme and a logical flow of ideas throughout.<p>(5.)  Writing style is good, both clear and graceful.<p>(6.)  Technical details of spelling, grammar, citations, etc. are correct.<p>(7.)  Paper is made as interesting as possible for the reader (without distracting from the central purpose ofexplaining the solution to a math problem.)<p><!-- separator --><table bgcolor=#7397b0 border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left><A NAME="three"></a>Paper Three</th></table><p><!-- statement -->Your third paper is to be a research paper on a topic either connected with material we have covered in the course orconnected in some other way with the topic of infinity.  Recommended length, 10-15 pages.<p>  If you are unsure of the suitability of your proposed topic, please talk to me about it.<p>The first assignment for this paper is not a draft of the paper, but a proposal.  In your paper proposal, you shouldnot only describe your proposed topic, but also say as much as you can about the projected content of your paper. For example, you can discuss the approach you plan to take, and you can say what particular aspects of your topic youwill discuss.  Your proposal should also include a list of several sources you plan to consult.  It should describeeach source briefly and say what you expect to get from each source.<p>In other words, you can expect to do a good deal of preliminary research before writing your paper proposal. Proposals, whether scholarly paper proposals like this one, scientific research grant proposals, or business projectplans, are often extremely important pieces of writing.  They should meet the same standards of clear and correctcommunication as any other piece of scholarly work.<p>Your project proposal will count toward your paper grade, but only on a credit or no credit basis.  That is, you willget full credit for an acceptable (and timely) proposal, and if your proposal is not acceptable you will get a chanceto rewrite it.<p><table bgcolor=#9db1c0 border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left>Grading</th></table><p>The grade for your third paper will be based on how well it meets these criteria:<p>(1.)  Paper has a clear focus and substantive content.<p>(2.)  Paper includes a synthesis of material drawn from a number of different, appropriate, and reputable sources.<p>(3.)  Synthesis and analysis is well thought out and supported.<p>(4.)  Paper is well-organized, with a clear theme and a logical flow of ideas throughout.<p>(5.)  Writing style is good, both clear and graceful.<p>(6.)  Technical details of spelling, grammar, citations, etc. are correct.<p>(7.)  Paper is understandable and interesting for the general reader.<p><!-- separator --><table bgcolor=#7397b0 border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left><A NAME="four"></a>Paper Four</th></table><p><!-- statement -->Your fourth paper is to be a scholarly paper on a topic that touches on both mathematical and philosophical concerns.  It may be primarily a research paper, like your third paper.  In this case, your paper should be more than simply a presentation of material; you should add something of your own perspective or analysis.  On the other hand, your paper may be primarily a philosophical essay, like your first paper.  In this case, it should be explicitly set in the context of the existing literature; you should contribute to or engage with, rather than work independently of, current scholarship.

<p>

Your paper could also, like your second paper, present the solution to a mathematical problem.  In this case, unlike your second paper, this paper should have a theme beyond solving the problem; the problem solving should be in the service of a larger goal.
