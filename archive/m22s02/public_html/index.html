If you must make travel plans beforethe schedule for final exams appears, do not make plans to leave Hanoverbefore June 4.&nbsp; Exams <b>cannot</b> be given early to accommodatetravel plans.<h3><hr WIDTH="100%">Homework Policy</h3>There will be homework assigned each week, which will be collected on Fridaysin class. I will also assign one or more additional long-term homeworkassignments that will be worth two or three times as much as an ordinaryassignment.&nbsp; I'll be happy to talk about homework problems&nbsp; andgive you hints during my office hours. You may (you are encouraged to)work&nbsp; together on the homework assignments.&nbsp; However, the workyou turn in should be your own. This means that after whatever discussionsyou have about the problems, you should write up your solutions on yourownand in your own words.<h3><hr WIDTH="100%">Grades</h3>The midterm, homework grade, and final exam will all count equally towardyour final grade.<h3><hr WIDTH="100%">The Honor Principle</h3>Every student who matriculates at Dartmouth agrees to abide by the academichonor principle.&nbsp; You have an obligation to act with integrity inyour own academic work, and to take action if you observe honor code violationsby others.&nbsp; Academic integrity is essential to the scholarly enterpriseand we take it seriously.<p>In Math 3, you are encouraged to work together on homework problems,and to use professors, other students, other textbooks, and generally anyresource you can find that will help you understand and work the problems.You must write up the homework solutions by yourself in your own words.In brief, collaborate but don't copy.<p>You must do all work on exams independently, without giving or receivingassistance of any kind.<h3><hr WIDTH="100%">Special Concerns</h3>Please talk to us as soon as possible, or whenever something comes up,about any special concerns you have about the class.&nbsp; If you havea disability and may require disability-related accommodations, talk tous as soon as possible; this includes invisible disabilities like chronicdiseases, learning disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities.&nbsp; Ifyou have athletic or other extracurricular commitments and hope to accommodatethem (for example, by taking midterms at alternative times), talk to us.&nbsp;If you are ill and fall behind on work, talk to us.&nbsp; If you are inany way concerned about the course or your performance in it, talk to us.If you can't do the homework, go to the tutorials, or talk to us. Makean appointment, either after class, by phone or via blitzmail, if you can'tmake regular office hours.<p><hr WIDTH="100%"><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</body></html>
