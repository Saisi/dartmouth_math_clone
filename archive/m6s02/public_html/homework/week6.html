Prisoner's Dilemma MiniProject:  Due Wednesday, 5/8
<p>

Visit the website from <a href="http://wings.buffalo.edu/soc-sci/pol-sci/courses/psc102/webpage/pdgame/pdmain.htm"> SUNY Buffalo </a> and read the tutorial on the Prisoners Dilemma.  Complete the quiz (you'll have to print a copy and fill in the multiple choice answers).

<P>
Visit <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~helfrich/prisoner/">    Serge Helfrich's website </a> (the one with the applet from class).  Explore the applet by experimenting with various p and b values, and report on your findings.  (What happens when both are low, both are high, one is high and one is low, etc., as well as a couple of interesting patterns).   Find examples of the stable states in this population (For example, all red and all blue might be possible states, there might be a mixture of the two, and there may be some states which longterm will alternate between yellow and green).
