Suppose that you are given three doors to choose from as in the MontyHall Problem.  Now, however, Monty will choose a door AT RANDOM and showyou what's behind it.  If he chooses the door that you chose, and it hasthe car, you win (the game is over).  If he chooses the door that you'vechosen and it has a goat, you lose (the game, again, is over).  If hechooses a door that you didn't choose and it has the car, you loseautomatically.  If he chooses a door that you didn't choose and it has agoat, then he presents you with the option of switching or staying. Should you switch?  What is your overall probability of winning thisgame.  (Hint:  Use a tree diagram)<p>2.  Suppose that Monty Hall presents you with four doors instead of 3(three goats and one car).   After you select a door, he'll open one ofthe unopened doors and show you a goat, then allow you to switch if youwant.  He'll then open one of the remaining unopened doors and show youanother goat, and then allow you the choice of the two remaining doors. Determine the optimal strategy by calculating the probabilitiesassociated with each.  Again, a tree diagram may be helpful.<p>3.  Suppose that Monty Hall presents you with four doors, but now thereare two cars and two goats.  You choose a door, then he opens one of theunchosen doors and shows you a goat.  He gives you the option ofswitching doors.  Should you?  Find the probability that you win in eachcase.  <p>Complete thse three exercises.  In addition, write a letter intended forParade Magazine columnist Marilyn vos Savant, defending her position onthe original problem that your probability of winning increases to 2/3when you switch.  The letter should include an explanation of the problemand should try to overcome the average reader's intuition that the chancesare 50-50.  <p><li>  Assigned Friday, 4/12:<P>Read Section 6.7.<p>Complete the following problems:<P>6.7 8, 10, 13, 17, 18<p>KEEP AN EYE ON THIS SPACE FOR CHANGES MADE DURING THE WEEK.  <! </TR></TABLE></td><!--table data end; end  of body of table--></TR></TABLE><A HREF="../../../../index.html"><font color=green>Dartmouth MathHome</A><BR><A HREF="http://www.dartmouth.edu/"><font color=green>Dartmouth CollegeHome</A><BR>   </TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
