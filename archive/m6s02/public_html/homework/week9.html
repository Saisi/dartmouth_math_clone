<p>
<li>Assigned Monday, 5/20:

<P>


Read Chapter 9 from For All Practical Purposes (class handout)
<p>

Complete the following problems:

<P>

Exercises 1ab,3,4abcd
<P>
d)If 45 voters who now prefer A over B over C (after the switch made in part c) know everyone's preferences, could they vote strategically to ensure a victory by A when using the voting method in part b?  (Due Friday)



<P>
<li> <B>  Tuesday 5/14, x-hour:  Noon-12:50  </B>

<p>

Section 13.4:  Digraphs
<p>
Exercises 13.4:  8, 10, 16, 18 (Due Friday)

<P>
<B> Miniproject 4 </B>

<P>

This fourth mini-project will be OPTIONAL and the grade for it will replace your lowest mini-project grade to date (which, for some of you, is a zero).  I don't want to flood people with work at the end of the term, but if you feel your grades could use a little boosting, then you may do this in an effort to boost your grade.  
<p>
This is the project:  Describe a scenario, real or fictional (preferably something from history, but if you're not historically inclined, then you may be creative in making up your own) where the plurality vote did not select the 'best' candidate for an elected position.  This may also include a sporting poll which did not select the best team at the end of the year for a given sport.  Decribe the events surrounding the candidates and the voters perception of them.  Describe a voting scheme that would have been more fair than the one used, and how that scheme should have been implemented.
<P>
Your paper should be 3-5 pages in length.  The miniprojects, should you choose to do them, are due no later than 8 AM next Friday, when you're showing up for your final exam.  
<P>

KEEP AN EYE ON THIS SPACE FOR CHANGES MADE DURING THE WEEK.
