<B>Text:</B>  <I>Elementary Number Theory and Its Applications,</I> Third Edition, by Kenneth H. Rosen<BR><BR>

<B>The Course:</B>  In this course, we will study interesting properties of integers and relationships between integers.  Also, we will discuss various applications of number theory, including those in computer science and cryptography.  Finally, we will study the history of number theory and some of the people who have made significant contributions to this field. <BR><BR>

<B>Grades:</B>  Grades for the course will be determined as follows:<BR>
<CENTER>Homework - 30%</CENTER>
<CENTER>Quizzes - 50%</CENTER>
<CENTER>Final Exam - 20%</CENTER><BR><BR>

<B>Homework:</B>  Homework will be assigned daily via the course website and will be due in class on the following Friday.  That is, each Friday, you will turn in the homework assigned the previous Friday, Monday, and Wednesday.  No late homework will be accepted.  I will drop your lowest homework score.  <BR><BR>

<B>Quizzes:</B>  Quizzes will be given during x-hour every Tuesday.  Each quiz will cover material from readings, lectures, and homeworks.  The first quiz will be given on Tuesday, September 29.  The last quiz, given on Tuesday, December 1, will be a make-up quiz.  This is the only make-up quiz that will be offered.  <BR><BR>

<B>Final Exam:  </B>The final exam will be cumulative.  The Registrar's Office schedules the final exam, which will occur during the period December 5-9.  If you must make travel plans before the schedule for final exams appears, <B>do not</B> make plans to leave Hanover before December 9.  Exams <B>will not</B> be given early to accommodate travel plans.<BR><BR>

<B>Honor Prinicple:</B>  On quizzes and exams, no help is to be given or received.  On homework, students are encouraged to collaborate, but NO COPYING.  In other words, you should feel free to talk to other students while you are in the process of thinking about a problem.  However, when it comes time to write up your solutions, you should do this by yourself without outside assistance.<BR><BR>

<B>Disabilities:</B>  Students with disabilities who will be taking this course and may need disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an appointment to see their instructor as soon as possible.  Also, they should stop by the <A HREF="http://www.dartmouth.edu/admin/acskills/">Academic Skills Center</A> in Collis Center to register for support services.<BR><BR>

<B>Special Dates:</B>  There will be no class held on Friday, October 9.  Homework will still be due that day.  Class will meet at 8:00 a.m. on Friday, October 30.  There will be no class held on Wednesday, November 25.  The last day of class is Wednesday, December 1.<BR><BR>
