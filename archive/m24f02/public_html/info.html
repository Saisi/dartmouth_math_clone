What is linear algebra?</P><P>Linear algebra is the study of vector spaces and linear transfomations. A vector space is a structure that abstracts and generalizes familiar objects from geometry and algebra. A linear transformation is a function between two vector spaces that preserves the structure. </P><P>Linear algebra is one of the most powerful mathematical tools used widely throught science and mathematics.  This is one of my favorite subjects and I hope that you will like it too!  I hope the following quote will inspire you to participate in this course.</P><blockquote><FONT COLOR=blue SIZE=5>"Mathematics is not for spectators; in order to gain in understanding, confidence, and enthusiasm one has to participate."</FONT>M.A. Armstrong </blockquote><P></P><P><HR SIZE=0></P><TABLE  BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=4 CELLSPACING=2 WIDTH=100%><TH ALIGN=left><A NAME="textbook"></A><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=red>Textbooks<FONT></TH></TABLE><P><B>Required</B><BR><UL><LI><I>Linear Algebra</I> by Friedberg, Insel, and Spence</UL><P>Of course, I invite you to visit the mathematics library (located in the second floor of Bradley Hall) and become acquainted with as many linear algebra books as you wish.  </P><P><HR SIZE=0></P><P><TABLE  BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=4 CELLSPACING=2 WIDTH=100%><TH ALIGN=left><A NAME="lectures"></A><LARGE><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=red>Scheduled Lectures</FONT></LARGE></TH></TABLE><P><UL><LI>MWF 1:45-2:50,  Bradley 104<LI>(xhour)  Thursday, 1:00-1:50 Bradley 104<BR><B>Note:</B> We will frequently meet during the x-hour to go over problem sets or catch up if we fall behind. </UL><P><HR SIZE=0></P><TABLE  BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=4 CELLSPACING=2 WIDTH=100%><TH ALIGN=left><A NAME="instructors"></A><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=red>Instructor</FONT></TH></TABLE><P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=6 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=250><TR ><TD ALIGN=LEFT>Professor   <AHREF="../../../~orellana/index.html"><B> Rosa Orellana</B></A></TD></TR><TR ><TD ALIGN=left>Office: 305 Bradley Hall<BR><B>Office Hours</B></A><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=4 CELLSPACING=1 WIDTH=300><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=red><TR ><TD ALIGN=center>Wed.</TD><TD ALIGN=center>9:45-10:45</TD></TR><TR ><TD ALIGN=center>Tues.</TD><TD ALIGN=center>2-3</TD></TR><TR ><TD ALIGN=center>Thurs. </TD><TD ALIGN=center>2-3</TD></TR><TR ><TD ALIGN=center>By Appointment</TD><TD ALIGN=center></TD></TR></TABLE></FONT></TD></TR><TR ><TD ALIGN=left><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=red>Phone: 646 - 2430</FONT><BR>or <A HREF="mailto:rosa.c.orellana@dartmouth.edu">BlitzMail:Rosa.C.Orellana@Dartmouth.EDU</A> (preferred)</TD></TR></TABLE>I encourage you to come to my office to discuss homework problems (yes, you can come before the homework is due), things that you don't understand in the course, opportunities for an REU (Research Experience for undergraduates) or if you are wondering what course to take next and need a little guidance. <P><P><HR SIZE=0></P><TABLE  BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=4 CELLSPACING=2  WIDTH=100%><TH ALIGN=left><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=red><A NAME="exams"></A>Exams</TH></FONT></TABLE><P>There will be two (probably part in-class and part take-home) exams and a finalexamination.
