        <p align="left">The oldest and the most famous statistical problem is
        the problem of how height of sons is correlated with the height of
        fathers. That problem was posed by Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911) and
        gave rise to the most important concept of statistics, regression.
        Galton discovered that taller fathers have shorter sons, and that is why
        the according statistical relationship was called 'regression'. Hundreds
        (if not thousands) of studies have been made on this subject. We will
        make a few more!</p>
        <p>The role of this team project is to apply the knowledge gained in the
        course to a real life problems: what is the distribution of height and
        weight across the gender, what are their main characteristics, how can
        we project weight given height and vise versa, are weight and height
        correlated in relatives (siblings, children, parents), does height
        converge, etc. I expect there will be four-five project topics related
        to statistical problems of weight and height among family members. Also,
        we will apply statistical hypothesis testing to verify if clothing
        industry follows the distribution of heights of women and men (do cloth
        sizes in stores correspond to actual proportions of people height?).
        What clothing companies know statistics better? You can even write a
        letter to companies telling them about your findings!</p>
        <p>We start with collecting data. So you will be asked to measure
        yourself and call up your relatives (siblings and parents, adults only).
        Basically we will record height, weight, and relationship. However, we
        will discuss in class what other measures can be taken.</p>
        <p>Each team will consist of four-five students, and the presentation
        will be held in class toward the end of the course. Each member of the
        team will receive the same amount of points. Maximum number of points
        the team can make is 15. The work on the project can be started as soon
        as we collect data. Thus, we will have one data set and each team will
        concentrate on a specific statistical problem related to that data set.</p>
