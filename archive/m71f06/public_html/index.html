<p>Please hand in your test at my office or leave in my mailbox.
</p>

<p> On problem 4 on the test, you are permitted to assume that
not only is <i>n</i> composite, but that it is divisible by
at least two different primes.  You will get 5 points extra
credit if you solve it as originally stated.

			<p style="text-align : justify">
The theme of the course is abstract algebra.  Most people think of
algebra as that part of math where you solve equations or manipulate
expressions which have letters in them.  This actually is not all
that closely related to abstract algebra, though there is a
connection.  Abstract algebra deals
with the structures of familiar objects, such as the integers,
the complex numbers, matrices, etc.  The idea is that when these
more concrete sets are studied in the abstract, certain of their
properties are forced upon them because of other properties already
assumed.  Thus, one can then deduce these other properties for
any system that has the basic assumed properties.  Depending on
how many of these basic axioms are assumed, we have groups, rings, and
fields.  These will be our object of study.

			</p>

<p>
<b>A very brief syllabus</b> (chapters from Dummit and Foote, Abstract Algebra):<br>
In week 1, we will study Chapter 0 (equivalence relations, integers).<br>
In the following 4 weeks, we will basically do a chapter per week,
with a few sections skipped.<br>
a small amount of time on fields.

<p> Homework due Monday, Sept. 25:<br>
Section 0.1, #1-5  (Try to do 2 and 3 in a "coordinate-free" way.
You are allowed to assume that matrix multiplication is associative
and that it satisfies the distributive law with matrix addition.) <br>
Section 0.2, #2, 5 <br>
Section 0.3, #5-7
</p>


<p> Homework due Monday, Oct. 2:<br>
Section 1.1, #1b, 1d, 2b, 2d, 9, 18, 19, 22, 25.<br>
Extra problem: Show that if <i>G</i> is a group and <i>x</i> is an
element of <i>G</i> of finite order <i>n</i>, then for all integers
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, we have
<i>x<sup>a</sup> = x<sup>b</sup></i> if and only if <i>a</i> &equiv <i>b</i> (mod <i>n</i>).<br>
<br>
Section 1.2, #1, 3; Section 1.3, #1, 3, 15.<br>
Instead of the hint for number 15, which I didn't understand, prove that
if <i>A, B</i> are disjoint subsets of {1,2,...,n} and if &sigma and &tau
are in <i>S<sub>n</sub></i> with &sigma moving only members of <i>A</i>
and &tau moving only members of <i>B</i>, then &sigma&tau=&tau&sigma
and |&sigma&tau| = lcm[|&sigma|,|&tau|].
</p>

<p>
Homework due October 9:<br>
Section 1.4, #4, 5, 8<br>
Section 1.5, #1<br>
Section 1.6, #3-8, 17-20<br>

Show that if <i>H</i> is a subgroup of the finite group <i>G</i>
that is not <i>G</i> itself, then |<i>H</i>| &le |<i>G</i>|/2.<br>
(Hint: Let <i>x</i> be an element of <i>G</i> that is not in
<i>H</i>, and show that no element <i>hx</i> can be in <i>H</i>
as <i>h</i> runs over the elements of |<i>H</i>|.)
</p>
<p> 
Homework due Wednesday, Oct. 18:<br>
Section 3.1, #1, 3 -8, 14.  (The roots of unity in the complex
numbers are those complex numbers <i>z</i> for which <i>z<sup>n</sup></i>=1
for some positive integer <i>n</i>.  They form a group under multiplication.)<br>
Sec. 2.2, #3, 9.<br>
Sec. 3.2, #5, 6. 
</p>
		  <p>
		  Homework due Monday, Oct. 23:<br>
		  Sec. 3.3, #1, 3, 7, 8.<br>
		  Sec. 3.5, #2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 13.<br>
		  </p>

<p>
Homework due Monday, October 30:<br>
Sec. 4.1, #1, 2, 3.<br>
Sec. 4.2, #2, 8, 9.<br>
Concerning 4.2.2, the "left regular representation of a group
<i>G</i> of order <i>n</i> into <i>S<sub>n</sub></i>" is the
same thing we did when we proved Cayley's theorem.  Namely,
each element <i>g</i> of <i>G</i> acts on <i>G</i> by left multiplication
and so can be associated with a particular permutation on
<i>n</i> letters.
</p>

		  <p>
		  Homework assignment due Monday, Nov. 13:<br>
		  Section 4.5, #1-3, 18-23.<br>

		  own additive inverse.]
		  </p>
