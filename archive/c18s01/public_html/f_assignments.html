These are intended to expose you to diverse ways of
approaching the topics involved. There will be four assignments during the
course and a take-home final; each of which will count for about one-fifth
of the grade. Your level and quality of involvement in class discussions
will also be considered in the grading process. There is no need to feel
intimidated by the topics; not everyone in the class, including your
professors, are experts on every topic considered.<P>
