<p> Homework due Wednesday, Sept. 27:<br>
General instructions for ALL homework assignments: Show your work and explain
your steps.  Just the answer is not sufficient.<br>
Section 1.1, #2, 6, 13 <br>
Section 1.2, #1, 3, 5, 7<br>
Section 1.3, #8 (assume <i>m, n</i> are positive), 14<br>
There was a bonus problem to figure the number of terms when
<i>(x<sub></i>1<i></sub>+x<sub></i>2<i></sub>+...+x<sub>k</sub>)<sup>n</sup></i>
is expanded using the multinomial theorem.  This can be thought
of as the number of size <i>n</i> multisets taken from <i>k</i>
distinct elements, and so is equal to <i>n+k-</i>1 choose <i>n</i>.

			<p style="text-align : justify"> Students are encouraged
			to work together to do homework problems. What is
			important is a student's eventual understanding of
			homework problems, and not how that is achieved. The honor
			principle applies to homework in the following way. <span
			style="color:#CC0000; font-weight:bold">What a student
			turns in as a homework solution is to be his or her own
			understanding of how to do the problem. Students must
			state what sources they have consulted, with whom they
			have collaborated, and from whom they have received
			help.</span> Students are discouraged from using solutions
			to problems that may be posted on the web for previous
			offerings of the course, and as just stated, must
			reference them if they use them. The solutions you submit
			must be written by you alone.  Any copying (electronic or
			otherwise) of anotehr person's code or solutions, in whole
			or in part, is a violation of the Honor Code.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align : justify">The honor principle
			applies to exams as follows:<span style="color: #CC0000">
			<b> Students may not give or receive assistance of any
			kind on an exam from any person except for the professor
			or someone explicitly designated by the professor to
			answer questions about the exam. Students may not use
			library or internet sources on take-home exam problems,
			but they may use their textbook and personal
			notes.</b></span></p>
			
			<p style="text-align : justify">If you have any questions as to whether some action
			would be acceptable under the Academic Honor Code, please
			speak to me or another member of the course staff, and we
			will be glad to help clarify things.  It is always easier
			to ask beforehand than to have trouble later!</p>
