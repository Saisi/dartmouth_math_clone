<p align="left"><b><font size="+2">Math 36 - test 2 review</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">Here are the topics that will be covered by test 
  2:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="+1">interval graphs - characterization theorems (involving such 
    definitions as chordal, transitively orientable, asteriodal triples, maximal 
    cliques), drawing graphs in interval representation.</font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Definition of boxicity (involving definitions of food webs, 
    competition graphs).</font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Other graphs defined similarily to competition graphs, such 
    as common enemy graphs, and domination graphs. (Don't worry about definitions 
    of unions and interesections like the mixed pair graphs or niche graphs).</font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Trophic Status - know the definition of both the Harary 
    measure and the revised measure (using longest path) that we worked with. 
    Be able to find trophic status of vertices in a digraph. Have an idea of the 
    axioms used.</font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Probability: know what a markov chain is, and when it is 
    applicable. Know definitions like ergodic chain (state), absorbing chain (state), 
    regular chain, transition matrix, transition digraph, canonical form of absording 
    chain matrix, fundamental matrix, N, matrix B (for these, know both how to 
    find them, and what they mean).</font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Look at the problems given during the term.</font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">Any questions, email me. </font></li>
</ul>
