  <li><font size="+1">Suppose that we make one of the equations in the competitive 
    hunters model a logistic growth model (ie, one of the hunters has a natural 
    limitation to its population size). So the equations are the following : <br>
    dx/dt = a(M-x)-bxy and dy/dt = py-cxy<br>
    Find the equilibrium points and stability lines (or curves). Explore the direction 
    of trajectories around the equilibium points (you do not need to use Taylor 
    Series, just see what you can determine with signs of the derivatives). Will 
    the system be stable? Does it depend on starting levels of population? Interpret 
    your results as best you can. (Note that there are at least two alternatives 
    depending on whether M&gt;p/c or not. Look at these two cases). </font> </li>
