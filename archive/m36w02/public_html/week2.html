    1/3 for wzyx; 1/3 for yxwz). Suppose that you are an agenda setter and you 
    do not like x. Give an agenda so that x does not win by sophisticated voting 
    method. Give an agenda so that x does not win by sincere voting method. Can 
    you give an agenda so that x does not win by both sophisticated and sincere? 
    If yes, give it, and if no, prove that you cannot.</font></li>
