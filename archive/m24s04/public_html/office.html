<big> Office Hours </big></center>


<big><P>I will have office hours Sunday and Thursday nights from 8:00 to 10:00
PM, and Monday, Wednesday and Fridays an hour before and after class.
Of course, if not of these times work with your schedule, <a
href="mailto:nathan.c.ryan@dartmouth.edu">blitz</a> me to make an appointment.
<P>
My office is 1-R in the basement of Bradley.  To get to it, you go
down the stair case near our classroom and through the door at the
bottom of the stairs.  You head straight and then before the ramp
heads down (near the bulletin board) you take a left.  Just before
you leave the building through the double doors you go left and up the
stair case.  My office is the last door on the left.  It has my name
on it and it says 1-R above the door.
