    <CENTER><H1>  Project #2 </H1></CENTER><p>Due Date: Wednesday 
Feb. 18th [NOTE: The first part of the project is due Feb. 11th, and 
presentations will be done in an X-hour Thursday Feb. 19
and in class Friday Feb 20.]<br>Type of Project:  Group [Groups may be 
of any size. All groups of 
3 or fewer students will be expected to have done the work of a 3 person 
project, those of more students will be graded with higher expectations]
<br>Focus of Project: Design and implement an experiment to test a 
hypothesis.</p><H2> NOTE: </H2><H3>You may wish to wait until Monday's 
lecture until concretizing your plans since that lecture will include some 
new tools that may allow you to run a more interesting or powerful 
experiment than you might otherwise be able to.</H3><p>
Description:<br>You will pick a topic of interest to you in which there 
is a hypothesis you wish to test. Your group will clearly explain the 
implementation as well as all other pertinent facts about the experiment 
in a paper prior to the experiment.  After running the experiment an 
analysis of results will be turned in and a short presentation made to the 
class.</p><p>Some questions we are concerned with are: <br>1) Does 
your project show proper attention to control show that your data is meaningful?<br>2) Did you pick an intelligent choice for alpha given the <u> GOAL </u> of your project.<br>3) Is your test statistic linked to your parameter in an appropriate way?<br>4. Does your project use the correct language and calculations for hypothesis testing?</p><p>The assignment has three parts:<br>a)<em>Pre-implementation write-up</em> You should discuss your goal, protocol, choice of significance level, estimation of power, contingency plans as precisely as possible.  A sample is provided <a href="WaterHyp2.pdf"> here </a>. This is due Feb. 11th.<br>b)After implementing your experiment, you should turn in an <em>analysis of results</em>, along with a discussion of whatever other factors someone reading your results should know. If you have a proposal for action based upon your experiment, include it as well. This is due Feb. 18th.<br>c)<em>Present your results</em> in class on Thursday Feb. 19th  or 
on Friday  Feb. 20th
