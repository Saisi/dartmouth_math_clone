 <h2>Math 5: Double Quiz   
</h2>
This  quiz will cover the basic of Chapters 7 and 8. 
 Please look over all of  chapters 7 and 8. With that said,  
the quiz itself  will contain only 2  slightly modified problems from 
chapter 7 "boxes" 1-32 (on pages181-192) 
<b> AND</b>  2  slightly modified problems from
Chapter 8 "boxes" 1-14 (pages 209-215). Though  this quiz covers fewer 
than 
20 pages of material, I encourage you to look over this material soon.   
Next Thursday we will have an problem session at 
our X-hour time in order to carefully answer any questions and go 
through some  examples.
