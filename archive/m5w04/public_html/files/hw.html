<b> Week 1:</b>
<p>
Do Chapter 1 of our text.  On Friday January 9th  you will be quizzed on 
4 randomly selected, slightly modified problems from this chapter.    
Your  first project will be to implement a pretest  of a survey. The 
details  concerning this project will be posted soon.  To prepare 
yourself, please 
read topics 1-5 concerning  "<a 
href="http://www.amstat.org/sections/srms/whatsurvey.html"> What is a 
Survey?
</a>".
   
<p> 

On Monday we will explore  <a
href="http://www.accessexcellence.org/WN/NM/madcow96.html"> Mad Cow 
Disease
</a>.  In particular,  we will be looking at the media's <a
href="http://www.mindfully.org/Farm/2003/farm2003.htm"> reaction </a> 
to the disease and discussing the following question:
<p>
1.  What is the chance of getting mad cow disease? 
<p> 
A BRIEF description of your solution to question  1 is due by
4:30  tomorrow and is  to be turned
into Professor Rudel's mail box on the third floor of Bradley Hall.
All group members names should be listed on you assignment.

<p>

On Wednesday  will continue <a
our exploration 
of Mad Cow Disease and our 
big  <a
href="Pros/Equal.pdf">observation</a>
 by 
exploring 
the following questions <a
href="news.html"> QUESTIONS</a>, with the following <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m5w04/files/sol.html"> solutions</a>.  

<p>

Once gain, a BRIEF description of your solutions to the questions is due by
4:30  tomorrow and is  to be turned
into Professor Rudel's mail box on the third floor of Bradley Hall.
All group members names should be listed on you assignment.
<p>
Recall, there is a quiz on Friday. You <b> may </b>  bring and use  a calculator. 
 Professor Leibon 
will have office hours on Thursday from 
11:00-12:00 in 308 Bradley, and he will be at the X-hour (from 
12:00-12:50)  
to  answer questions.
<p>
<b> WE WILL NOT MEET ON SATURDAY!  We will makeup this lecture in  an 
X-hour (TBA).</b>



<hr>
<b> Week 2:</b>
<p>
Do pages 40-57 of Chapter 2 of our text.  On Friday January 16th  you will 
be quizzed on
4 randomly selected, slightly modified problems from this chapter.
Your  first <a
href="proj1.html"> project </a> will be to implement a pretest  of 
a survey.  Please
read topic 9 concerning  "<a
href="http://www.amstat.org/sections/srms/whatsurvey.html"> What is a
Survey? </a>".

<p>
On Monday: Survey Introduction.  We will imagine the following scenario:
<p>
Suppose the BAA (the Beef Association of America) has   
 <a
href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/living/DailyNews/madcow_poll010124.html"> 
concluded </a> that there is unfounded fear of beef in America after the 
BSE case discovered in Washington.  You have been hired by the BAA to 
write  an article aimed at reassuring Americans  that beef is safe. 

<p>
1. How might you use our  <a
href="news.html"> comparisons</a> between 
driving risks and Lottery chances to help 
you argue your case?
<p>
2. To answer question  requires that you have good intuitions  for 
how  Americans view these topics.  Develop a short survey to test whether 
your intuitions are correct.
<P>
3. What other methods might you use to test these intuitions?


<p>


On Wednesday we began discussing random samples and margin of error.
Note: professor Leibon
will be at the X-hour (from 
12:00-12:50 this Th
to  answer questions.
On Friday you will administer your pretest survey (from  your first <a
href="proj1.html"> project</a>). 
<p>
On Friday we will perform our pretests (as best we can).  If we have 
enough time we will administer the quiz.  If not, then  we will 
postpone  the quiz  till Wednesday.   




<hr>
<b> Week 3:</b>
<p>
Monday is a Dartmouth holiday. Here are some additional office hours to be 
held on Tuesday January 20th.  Recall, your 
first project is due on 
Wednesday January 21st.
<p>
Office Hours:
<p>
Rudel from  2:30-3:30 in Bradley 1-F,
<p>
Leibon from 3:30-5:30 in Bradley 308,
<p>
and by appointment.
<p>
On Wednesday we will administer our  quiz (the quiz  that was postponed 
from  last  Friday).  Your next Quiz will cover pages 57 through 
76 of the text and be administered  on Monday January 27th. We 
will begin discussing what it  <a
href="Pros/Sam.pdf"> means</a> to randomly sample something
We will be looking at the Iowa story: 
"<a
href="http://www.themilwaukeechannel.com/politics/2750996/detail.html"> King</a> 
of the mountain", "a <a
href="http://www.themilwaukeechannel.com/politics/2769013/detail.html"> 
casual</a> slide", "a <a
href="http://www.townhall.com/election2004/">cliff</a>?",
<a
href="http://www.gwu.edu/~action/2004/chrniowa.html"> "Why</a>?", and "What
<a
href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1059923/posts"> Now</a>"?

<p>
Friday: Today we will examine how
to model such a random sampling process.
First we examine an empirical test case by  <a
href="Dean.htm"> faking</a> the Iowa results, and then trying to abstract 
and capture this model via the binomial distribution.
(Warning: You may need to use Explorer in order to view the "faking" 
link.)

<hr>
<b> Week 4:</b>
<p>

Do Chapter 3 of our text.  On Monday  February 2nd  
you will
be quizzed on
4 randomly selected, slightly modified problems from this chapter.  
<p>
Tomorrow is the NH primary. Here is an organization of the recent <a
href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/"> poll</a> data, while here 
are the latest 
<a
href="http://tradesports.com/"> odds</a>.
On Monday we will be "flipping" a "coin" and 
asking the 
following fundamental 
questions:
<p>
1.  Suppose our "coin" is fair. What do we <a
href="Graph251.html"> expect</a> to happen when we 
"flip"  it?
<p>
2. Suppose we "flip" our "coin" 25 times.  How might you decide whether or 
not our "coin" is biased?
<p>
3.  Suppose the "coin" is fair.  What is the <a
href="Flip251.html"> chance</a> that  you declare 
the  "coin" biased?

<p>
Wednesday: The primary results, how did the <a
href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Presidential_04/new_hampshire_polls.html"> 
polls</a>  do?  Today we <a
href="Pros/Hyp.pdf"> abstract</a> our hypothesis test.  


<p>
Thursday: Excel Slam 1 (12:30). You need to organize data somehow. If you 
already 
know how to use a spread sheet program great! For those who don't, we will 
be running some optional sessions  to  <a
href="http://www.ncsu.edu/labwrite/res/gt/gt-menu.html"> learn</a> how to 
use Excel.
This Thursday will be a brief introduction, and at this session a  sign up 
sheet will be  available  for students who want to attend next Thursday's 
Excel Slam 2, which will be held at the 
Starr Instructional Center. (At 12:30ish the 
first assignment will handed  back and   I'll  stick around
to answer questions.
<p>
Friday:  z values and the normal distribution. At least  half this 
class 
will devoted  to a going through the "harder" material in chapters 2 and 
3.   Do  chapter 3 before Friday  and come to class  prepared with 
questions.
How do you estimate things that happen <a
href="http://tradesports.com/">once </a>?



<hr>
<b> Week 5:</b>
<p>

Do Chapter 4 of our text.  
On Monday  February 9th
you will
be quizzed on
4 randomly selected, slightly modified problems from this chapter, and from
pages 92-126 of the text.

<p>
Recall, we will have a quiz today on page 59-91 of the text.
<b> Professor  Leibon will have extra office hours from 
9:00-10:00 Monday morning to answers question about this material.</b>
The book has some <a
href="typos.html"> typos</a>. <b> Note: You can get  extra 
credit towards your 
quiz grade for finding typos</b>, so keep a sharp eye out and e-mail professor 
Leibon  the 
typos 
that you  find!  Check the <a
href="typos.html"> list</a> first, you will only receive extra credit for  
typos that have not yet made 
the official list.  
<p>
The remainder of this week will  will be  <a
href="Pros/Hyp2.pdf">  hypothesis test</a>  practice days, in preparation 
for  you <a
href="proj2.html"> group project</a>.
<p>
In particular, we will run our    Hanover tap water 
hypothesis
test that we designed together.  Here is our <a
href="WaterHyp2.pdf"> proposal</a> together with the Excel <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m5w04/files/WH.xls"> Computations</a> and the  <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m5w04/files/DataCharts.xls"> Data Charts</a> discussed in the proposal. 
Having gone through this should help you with your <a
href="proj2.html"> group project</a>, and in particular with the section 
due next Wednesday. For some further help, 
here is Roselinde's excellent
example of a  project 1,  so that you can see an example of the type of 
thing we are looking for: her <a
href="Test2.htm">write up</a> and her <a href="Proj1X.htm"> Graphs and 
Data</a>. (I apologize for the type setting
problems that occurred when converting this document to a web page.  If
you'd prefer here is the original source code of the  <a 
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m5w04/files/Proj1.doc">write up</a> and the <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m5w04/files/Proj1.xls">   Graphs and 
Data</a>.)
<p>



<hr>
<b> Week 6:</b>
<p>
Project Week! 
Here is a <a
href="WaterHyp2.pdf">sample</a> of what is due Wednesday, and here is a 
sample <a 
href="WHPP.htm">  presentation</a> (your presentation is not due till 
a week from Thursday).  This presentation is a presentation of 
our Hanover tap water hypothesis test (the test we administered in class 
last 
Friday). Sometime in the next week you will be administering your own 
hypothesis test as part of you group project.  Since this is likely to 
be time consuming, there will be <b> no</b> quiz next week. However, you 
should  read through chapters 5 and 6 in order to expand the list of 
candidate  test  statistics available to you for  your hypothesis test 
(as lectured  on Monday).
<p>

On Wednesday we begin studying <a
href="Pros/Bush.pdf"> probability</a>, a topic that is likely to be the 
heart of your final individual project.  Our first discussion is very 
reminiscent of the original text book on probability by <a
href="Pros/huygens.pdf"> Huygens</a>.  We will be looking at Huygens from 
the point of view of various <a
href="https://www.tradesports.com/jsp/datafeed/liveprices/LivePrices.jsp?1076509935916"> 
bets</a> and <a
href="http://www.betfair.com/"> wagers</a>.


<hr>
<b> Week 7:</b>
<p>
Your primary work this week will  be completing and presenting your 
group projects.  In class we will be taking our first serious stab at 
probability. On Monday,  we will  explore the <b> Fundamental Mysteries of 
Probability</b> and  
<p>
<center> 
<p>
 <a
href="Pros/Price.pdf"> Fair Price.</a>
<p>
</center> 
<p>
On Wednesday. we will use the notion of Fair price to introduce 
the notion of 
<p>
<center>
<p>
 <a
href="Pros/Prob.pdf"> Probability.  </a>
<p></center></p> 
Thursday's  X-hour and Friday's class will consist of  project 
presentations, and 
attendance is <b> required</b>.
<p>
By Friday morning, please email  professor Leibon an 
 electric copy of your Power
Point
presentation, your proposal, and your
data analysis (so that they can be posted on the web).
Here is when you will  <a

Due to a rather large number of requests to meet in order to discuss final 
projects, we will NOT be holding an X-hour today.  With that said, I will 
be free from 
10:00-3:45 Thursday March 4 
for appointments in order to discuss your final projects.   I will also be 
in my office (308 Bradley)  from 12:00-2:00 if you simply want to drop by 
in order to discuss you final project (I will only be able to handle one 
student at a time, so be prepared to wait a few minutes).   I will also be 
free from 
9:00-5:00  on March 9th and on 10th
 (next Tuesday and Wednesday) in order to help people with their projects 
(by appointment).  You may begin reserving half hour time slots now if you 
wish.

<b> Week 10:</b>
Monday (March 8): The Psychology of the Random: Random Music and Poetry.
We will examine the  <a
href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/personal/matt.davis/Cmabrigde/"> 
redundancy  </a> of English, and how to  <a
href="http://www.scphillips.com/morse/">
quantify  </a> this redundancy.In particular, we will think about some of 
the ideas  of   <a
href="http://math.ucsd.edu/~crypto/java/ENTROPY/">
Claude Shannon</a>.  This redundancy allows  
for all sorts of nice things, like  <a
href="http://www.nightgarden.com/shannon.htm">
style</a> AND <a
href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/01/20040120-7.html"> 
poetry</a>.  Such freedom tells us that randomness can 
play a 
<b> big roll</b>, and we will explore this with some <a

music</a>.
