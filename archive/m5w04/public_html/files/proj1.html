    <CENTER><H1>  Project #1 </H1></CENTER><p>Due Date: Wednesday Jan. 21th [NOTE: you must have your survey available for pretest Friday Jan. 16th]<br>Type of Project:  Individual<br>Focus of Project: Design, Test, and Analyze a survey.</p><p>Description:<br>You will pick a topic relevant to the vast majority of college students.There is no need to make the topic specifically geared to college students,but it must be one that a majority of college students have an opinion on.A pre-test survey must be ready by Friday 16th, and your final results willbe due Jan. 21th.</p><p>The principal questions we are concerned with are: <br>1) Do your questions gauge the opinion  you wish to guage?<br>2) What types of internal bias are there in your survey, and what is theirmagnitude?<br>3) How reliable are your results?  What steps could be taken to make yourresults more reliable?<br>4. Would one expect certain bias due to demographic?  Does such bias show up in the results to your survey?</p><p>The assignment has three parts:<br>a) An introduction explaining what topic you are doing your survey on, why you are doing your survey [that is, how would you hypothetically use the information from the survey], and why you choose it. <br>b) The pre-test of the survey [done in class] <br>c) An analysis of the results.  What problems arose in the pre-test?  How would you deal with these problems?  What type of further pretesting would you after this initial one?  What problems would you expect to encounter when you made a "real" survey that may not have shown up in the pre-test, and what adjustments might be needed accordingly?</p></body>
