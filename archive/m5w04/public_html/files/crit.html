 <h2>Math 5: Critique 
</h2>
Imagine our chance presentations (as witnessed in class Feb. 19-23)  were 
a  part of a conference on 
"interesting topics." The conference proceedings (the chance project 
write-ups) will be published, together with a collection of letters to the 
editor. You are asked to submit such a letter. In this letter, you should 
take <b>ONE</b> of the topics discussed at the "conference" and produce 
either a 
constructive criticism or elaborate on an idea about how to improve the 
study that was discussed. You may want to tackle questions like: Was the 
data collected legitimately? Did they collect the right data to test what 
they were interested in studying? Was the statistical test that they 
applied appropriate for this data? Would you accept their conclusions, 
even if they were contrary to your previous beliefs? Please carefully 
justify your point of view.
<p>
This letter to the editor should be about two pages long (single spaced 
or 4 pages double spaced) and is due by 
class time on  Friday February 27.
