    <b> Course description:</b> 
  </center>

<p align="left"> In this course, we will use current events, guest 
lectures, and 
  personal experiences, to examine fundamental statistical and 
probabilistic concepts 
  as they appear in daily life. By the end of the course, you will be able 
to 
  critically analyze the statistics you come across in your day-to-day 
life. Throughout 
  the course, you will produce and analyze statistical information of your 
own. 
  You will also evaluate other students' analyses. 

<p align="left">We may view statistics as the organization and analysis of 
data. 
  The following quantity would be an example of a statistic: the 
percentage of 
  people in the US who own a pinball machine. There are several useful 
statistical 
  ideas which we will explore in this course, including the average, the 
standard 
  error, and the correlation coefficient. Sometimes a statistic is best 
understood 
  with a picture as opposed to a number, and we will study such visual 
aids including: 
  the histogram, the scatter plot, and the regression line. 
<p> Probability may be viewed as an attempt to understand randomness. For 
example, 
  one might use probability to make sense of the following question: If 
you chose 
  a person in the US at random, what is the chance that they own a pinball 
machine? 
  We will explore several probabilistic concepts, including that of model, 
expected 
  value, variance, confidence intervals, along with certain explicit 
models including 
  the binomial model, normal distributions, and the models which arise in 
various 
  gambling situations. 
<p> Many of the issues explored in Chance lie at the intersection of 
statistics 
  and probability. For example, you might interview 1,000 US citizens and 
ask 
  them "Do you own a pinball machine?" and then collect the following 
statistic: 
  the percentage of these 1,000 people who own a pinball machine. Suppose 
8% of 
  those interviewed answered yes. With what right do you have to claim 
that 8% 
  of the US population owns a pinball machine? To answer this, one has to 
understand 
  how to give a statistic meaning with probability, which can be quite a 
tricky 
  business. Information will be presented to you in this form throughout 
your 
  life, and it is likely that you will make decisions based on such 
information. 
  The primary goal of this course to help you better understand such 
information, 
  allowing you to make more educated decisions in situations where 
statistics 
  arise. 

<p><b>Assignments and Grading:</b> Your grade for the course is based on 
individual  and group projects, a critique of other students' work, 
class   participation, and weekly quizzes. 
60% of your grade 
for the course will be based on three projects. 
The two of these projects are 
individual projects, the first worth  10% of 
your grade and a final project worth 25% of your grade. 
The there will also be  
a group project, conducted by several students 
  working together,  worth 25% 
of your grade. 
<! and has four  parts: a proposal, a written report, a pretest, and a  
presentation  made by the group to the rest of the class.> 
The remainder of your grade will be based on your critique of another 
groups' presentations (15%), your participation in the course (10%), 
and weekly quizzes (15%).  All assignments due dates and 
announcements will be posted in the 
<A HREF="hw.html">Class Log</A>.
 




<p><b>Text:</b> <u>   A Self-teaching Guide, Statistics </u>, by Donald 
J. Koosis, 
  available in the Dartmouth Bookstore. 
<p><b>Computing:</b> We will be computing and organizing data with the 
help of 
  the <i>Excel</i> and<i> Maple</i> programs, both of which are available 
on Public. 
  Everyone should make sure that they have access to a computer running 
both these 
  programs. 
<p><b>Chance Web Site:</b> A lot of interesting information can be found 
at the 
  the Chance web site, <a 
href="http://dartmouth.edu/~chance/">http://dartmouth.edu/~chance/</a>.
<p><b>Honor Policy:</b> Collaboration is encouraged during all phases of 
this 
  class, excluding the writing up of your individual projects and 
critique. That 
  said, you <b>must</b> indicate all collaboration on an assignment when 
it is 
  handed in, and give credit to the people involved. 
<p><b>Students with Disabilities:</b> We encourage students with 
disabilities, 
  including invisible disabilities, like chronic diseases and learning 
disabilities, 
  to discuss with us any appropriate accommodations that might be helpful. 
You 
  should do this by the end of the second week of the term, to ensure that 
we 
  will have time to devise a workable solution. You should also contact 
the Academic 
  Skills Center in 301Collis. All discussions will be confidential between 
the 
  student and the two instructors, although we may need to consult the 
Academic 
  Skills Center to verify registration for their services, and to discuss 
appropriate 
  implementation. Please do not wait to come talk to us; we want to 
provide an 
  optimal learning environment; to do this, we need information from you.
