<p>

During this course you will <b> need </b> to be able to utilize 
some sort of data analysis program. Microsoft's Excel program is a common 
choice and one that  the instructors can give support to.  It is available 
on public by going to 
"Licensed Software", then "KeyServer Controlled Software", the "Full 
Support", then "Excel 4.0". This folder contains both the programs and 
sundry useful material.  If you are having trouble loading 
this program, using public, or using Excel there are  various   
forms of  <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~helpdesk/"> help  </a>   
available to you.
For 
more sophisticated 
computational needs we will utilize the Maple computer program. 
Maple is also available on public. 
Here is some help regarding down loading Maple 7 to a 
<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/software/maple7-mac.html"> Mac </a>
and here is some help for loading it onto a 
<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/software/maple-pc.html"> PC </a> 
(these links are down, I will find out why).
<p>
You will also need to be able to use various databases to retrieve 
information and statistics.  The college pays BIG BUCKS so that you have 
access to many 
<a

> digital  </a> data collection.   If you are having problems accessing 
these collections then 
<a 
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/infosys/dciswww/dcishelp.shtml#Opening_a_Database"
> help  </a> is available  (these links are changed I will find out why).
