The final exam will be scheduled by the Registrar. If you have   a conflict with a midterm exam, please talk to your professor <i>as soon as   possible</i> about scheduling an alternate time. With less than a week's notice,   scheduling an alternate time may not be possible. Final exams are given<b> only</b>   during the scheduled times.</p><p><b>Tutorials:</b> 6-8 PM Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Monday nights when   there is a class in the x-hours on Tuesday, in Bradley 102.</p><p><b>Homework:</b> Homework and reading will be assigned each class period and   will be due by 5 PM the day of the next class meeting. (This will vary with   the use of x-hours.) The assignment will also be posted on our <a href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m3w03/m3hmwk.html">homework   page</a>. You should submit homework to the homework boxes on the first floor   of Bradley Hall. Late homework will be accepted for partial credit but may not   be graded. If you have a valid reason for turning in homework late (such as   an illness or a family emergency), please talk to your professor.</p><p><b>Grading: </b>The course grade is based on homework (20%), midterms (25%   each), and the final exam (30%). </p><p><b>Honor Principle:</b> Every student who matriculates at Dartmouth agrees   to abide by the academic honor principle. You have an obligation to act with   integrity in your own academic work, and to take action if you observe honor   code violations by others. Academic integrity is essential to the scientific   enterprise and we take it seriously.<br>  <br>  In Math 3 you are encouraged to work together on homework problems, and to use   professors, tutors, other students, other textbooks, and generally any resource   you can find that will help you understand and work the problems. You must write   up the homework solutions by yourself in your own words.<br>  <br>  You must do all work on exams independently, without giving or receiving assistance   of any kind.</p><p><b>Disabilities:</b> If you have a disability of any sort that may affect your   participation in the course or require accommodations, please speak to the professor   at the beginning of the term. These conversations will be completely  confidential, with the single exception that the professor may contact the Student   Disabilities Coordinator at  the Academic Skills Center to discuss appropriate accommodations. Students with   disabilities that may need  classroom accommodations should also talk to the Student Disabilities Coordinator   directly.</p><p><b>Special Concerns:</b> Please talk to your professor as soon as possible,   or whenever something comes up, about any special concerns you have about the   class. If you have athletic or other extracurricular commitments and hope to   accommodate them (for example, by taking midterms at alternative times), talk   to the professor. If you are in any way concerned about the course or your performance   in it, talk to the professor. If you can't do the homework, talk to the professor.   Also talk to the tutor about any of your concerns. Make an appointment if you   cannot come to our regular hours. We are here and we want to see you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Last updated 1/7/2003.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
