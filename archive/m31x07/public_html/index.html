<h2><font color=blue> Homework </font></h2>
Homework will be assigned weekly and will be due Monday at the beginning of class. Late homework will NOT be accepted, except in extreme circumstances.<br><br>

You <font color=blue> must </font> individually write up your own solutions, but I <font size=6 color=blue> highly encourage </font> you to work together in groups on the homework!  Please note that this applies only to the homework: exams must be done independently.

<br><br>

Click <a href="assignments.html">here</a> for a list of the current assignments.

On Homework: You <font color=blue> must </font> individually write up your own solutions, but I <font size=6 color=blue> highly encourage </font> you to work together in groups on the homework!<br><br>
