<p>The Registrar's Office schedules the final exam, which will occur during
the period March 9 -- 13. If you must make travel plans before the schedule
for final exams appears, do not make plans to leave Hanover before March
13.&nbsp; Exams will <b>not</b> be given early to accommodate travel plans.
<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Homework Policy</h3>
Homework should be dropped off and picked up in the boxes just outside
the front of Bradley 101, our classroom.
<p>There will be homework assignments assigned each class day, and due
before the following class.&nbsp; Late homework will not be accepted.&nbsp;
If you have a valid reason for turning in homework late (such as illness
or a family emergency) please talk to us.
<p>You may (you are encouraged to) work&nbsp; together on the homework
assignments.&nbsp; However, the work you turn in should be your own. This
means that after whatever discussions you have about the problems, you
should write up your solutions on your own
<br>and in your own words.
<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Grades</h3>
The midterms will count for 25% each, the final will count for 30%, and
the homework will count for 20% of your final grade.
<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">The Honor Principle</h3>
Every student who matriculates at Dartmouth agrees to abide by the academic
honor principle.&nbsp; You have an obligation to act with integrity in
your own academic work, and to take action if you observe honor code violations
by others.&nbsp; Academic integrity is essential to the scholarly enterprise
and we take it seriously.
<p>In Math 3, you are encouraged to work together on homework problems,
and to use professors, other students, other textbooks, and generally any
resource you can find that will help you understand and work the problems.
You must write up the homework solutions by yourself in your own words.
In brief, collaborate but don't copy.
<p>You must do all work on exams independently, without giving or receiving
assistance of any kind.
<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Special Concerns</h3>
Please talk to us as soon as possible, or whenever something comes up,
about any special concerns you have about the class.&nbsp; If you have
a disability and may require disability-related accommodations, talk to
us as soon as possible; this includes invisible disabilities like chronic
diseases, learning disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities.&nbsp; If
you have athletic or other extracurricular commitments and hope to accommodate
them (for example, by taking midterms at alternative times), talk to us.&nbsp;
If you are ill and fall behind on work, talk to us.&nbsp; If you are in
any way concerned about the course or your performance in it, talk to us.
If you can't do the homework, go to the tutorials, or talk to us. Make
an appointment, either after class, by phone or via blitzmail, if you can't
make regular office hours.
