A main goal of this course is to introduce you to abstract mathematics. You will learn
about the "art of mathematical proof" through linear algebra.  Your assignments and exams will be evaluated on your ability to write proofs as well as in your knowledge of linear algebra. </P>
<P>
Linear algebra is one of the most powerful mathematical tools used widely throught science and mathematics. In this course you will learn about vector spaces and linear transformations between them.  This is one of my favorite subjects and I hope that you will like it too!  I hope the following quote will inspire you to participate in this course.

I encourage you to come to my office to discuss homework problems (yes, you can come before the homework is due), things that you don't understand in the course, opportunities for an REU (Research Experience for undergraduates) or if you are wondering what course to take next and need a little guidance.

There will be two (probably part in-class and part take-home) exams and a final
examination. They will probably be held during the weeks of Oct. 23 and November 20.
The exact dates will be announced during class at least one week before the exam.
<P>
<P>
The Registrar's Office schedules the final exam, which will occur
during the period December 6-10. If you must make travel plans before
the schedule for final exams appears, <B>do not
</B>make plans to leave Hanover before December 10. Exams <B>will not
</B>be given early to accommodate travel plans under any circumstances.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Written homework will be assigned daily and will be collected
weekly, due <B>at the beginning</B> of Wednesday's class.  Homework assigned on M,W,F 
of one week is due on Wednesday of the following week.
<P>
While homework is collected weekly, it is assigned daily so that
you can work on it daily since many of the problems you consider will
require reflection.  Moreover, lectures assume that you have at least
begun to assimilate the ideas presented in the problems.  In other
words, waiting until the last moment to do your homework will be
detrimental to your understanding and measured progress; but of
course, the decision is yours. 
<P>
You can use books from the library as a resource in doing your homework. 
If you do this, please write in your homework the citations of the books you 
have used. 
<P>
<LI>All homework assignments will be posted on the course assignment's
<A HREF = "hw.html"><B>web page</B></A>.  

<LI>Late homework will not be accepted under any circumstance.  
Since this seems harsh, I will allow you to drop 2 homeworks with lowest scores.

<LI>Unexcused late and missing papers count zero.

<LI>Homework is to be written <B>neatly</B> using one side of 8 1/2 x
11 inch paper.  Do <B>not</B> use paper from a spiral notebook unless
you can tear off the ragged edge.  All papers are to be stapled.

<LI>
Use <B>English</B>.  If you can't read your solutions aloud as
fluently as if you were reading your textbook, try using nouns and
verbs in your write ups!
</UL>
<P>
If you  do not follow this guidelines, your homework will be returned to 
you ungraded.

The course grade will be based upon the scores on the homework, two
exams, participation (this means attending class and office hours as well as 
asking and responding to questions), the <A HREF="project.html">project</A> and the final exam.

<B>On Exams:</B> No help given or received from anyone. You may not use books or notes during in-class exams. For take-home exams you can use your class notes only. 

<P><B>On Homework:</B> Collaboration is permitted and encouraged, but <B>NO COPYING
</B>. In other words, you should feel free to talk to other students while
you are in the process of thinking about a problem. However, when it comes
time to write up your solutions, you should do this by yourself without
outside assistance.

Students with disabilities who will be taking this course and may need

appointment to see their instructor as soon as possible, certainly
within the first two weeks of the course. Also, they should stop by
the <A HREF="http://www.dartmouth.edu/admin/acskills/">
