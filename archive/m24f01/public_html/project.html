</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond,Times New Roman">
<BLOCKQUOTE>Linear algebra is a very powerful subject 
because of its wide range of applications to other branches of
science. For instance, computer science (image processing), 
statistics, physics, engineering, economics as well as
social and natural sciences. In addition linear algebra is used in 
geometry, differential equations and analysis.  The
purpose of this project is for you to learn about applications of 
Linear Algebra. </BLOCKQUOTE> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>One of the goals of the course is to introduce you 
to "abstract mathematics". Therefore you will see an
emphasis on proofs and abstract concepts. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><DIR>

<P>Because of the level of abstraction in this course, 
I am afraid that it will escape your notice that Linear Algebra is 
not only beautiful but also extremely useful. Unfortunately, the quarter is too short for 
I to cover the applications as well. </P> 
<P>Your project is to find an application of Linear Algebra to other fields of
science, including other areas of mathematics. The mathematics library is located
 in the second floor of Bradley Hall.</P> 
<P>This is intended as a group project. Your group should consist of <B>no
more than 3</B> people.</P> <P>Here are some preliminary deadlines 
(subject to change if the instructor thinks is necessary):</P>

<FONT FACE="Garamond,Times New Roman">10/15/2001</B> --- One page project proposal is due.  
(I suggest that you talk to me before then, so that you don't spend too much time on something 
that I might not approve.)</P> </FONT>
