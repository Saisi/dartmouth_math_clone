Homeworks will be due in each Wednesday at the start of class (or to my office beforehand). They
will include material covered by the end of class of the Friday prior to the due date . The homework is your best chance to practice the techniques learned during the course and as such is vital if you are to understand everything as fully as possible. <br>


<font color=red><b> Please note that late homework will not be accepted. </b> </font><br>

<br>

<b> Homeworks must be: </b> <br>
<li>Written up neatly and carefully on 8.5 x 11 paper. <br> 
<li>Ordered so that the grader can easily find all solutions. <br>
<li>Stapled if there is more than one sheet. <br>
<li>Clearly marked with your name. <br>

<br>

It is advised that you try some relevant WebWork problems beforehand and then work in groups when solving the homework
problems. However, you should write up the final versions individually
to ensure that you understand the concepts involved. 
<br>

<p><hr><p>

<b>Grading:</b> Your homeworks will be graded by an assigned course grader.  The total each week will be 25 points. Each week 3 or 4 questions will be randomly selected for careful attention, the others be graded on choice of technique and correct completion. <br>
