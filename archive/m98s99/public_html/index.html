<CENTER>Class Discussion - 20%</CENTER>

<B>Term Project:  </B>The term project will consist of equally weighted written and oral components.  Topics may include a specific mathematical result, person, group of people, or time period that is of some interst to you.  The written component will be a 10-20 page paper, due by noon on Monday, June 7.  The oral component will be a 45-60 minute presentation given during class.
