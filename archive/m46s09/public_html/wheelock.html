Wheelock Books is located across the street from Collis at 2 West
Wheelock
St. in the building on stilts.
<br>
It is <b>locally-owned</b>, unlike Dartmouth Bookstore, amazon, ebay, 
etc.
<p>
The first week of class `bookrush' hours  
are:
<br>Saturday (3/28): 12 pm - 5 pm
<br>Sunday (3/29): 12 pm - 8 pm
<br>Monday to Thursday (3/30 - 4/2): 8 am - 9 pm
<br>Friday (4/3): 8 am - 6 pm
<br>Saturday & Sunday (4/4 - 4/5): 12 pm - 5pm
<p>
Beginning on Monday, April 6th, we resume our normal business hours of
weekdays 9 am to 5 pm.
<p>
Should you have any students in your class who are
unable to climb stairs, we have a doorbell at ground level which they can
ring for assistance.
<p>
In addition, they still offer (I believe) these services to make 
book-buying 
more convenient
for students during book rush:
<p>
Personal Shopper Service:
Students can stop by the store entrance, tell my personal shopper staff
their courses, and return an hour later to find their textbooks waiting
for them.
<p>

A student can check our prices online, email us an order, and pick up
their books the next day.
