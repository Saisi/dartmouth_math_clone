<ul>
<li>p.8, #4: energy yield e should be E
<li>p.38, 3rd eqn: u(x) should read u(t)
<li>p.40, 3rd bullet: t^\alpha \sin(\beta \ln t) rather than
t^\alpha \sin \ln(\beta t). Similarly for cos type.
<li>p.40, #1c: y should be u
<li>p.64-65: `-' symbols are for a bullet list, not minus signs (misleading).
<li>p.65 line 3: \lambda>0 rather than \lambda<0 with a dot
<li>p.68, #6: double-dot should be on x not on m
<li>p.79, end 1st para: `See Fig. 1.23' is not relevant.
<li>p.79, #1a: doesn't work out that 2nd critical point involves integers
so is a mess
<li>p.79, last line: x' should read y'
<li>p.96, end 1st para: f(eps)<< g(eps) rather than f(eps)
<li>p.98, line 4,8: E(t,eps) = O(eps^3) not O(eps^2)
<li>p.100, #1: answer (ybar')^2 should be ybar'|ybar'| for resistive sign
<li>p.103, #14: there's no exact solution (...is there?)
<li>p.109, last line: t's should be x's
<li>p.123, #10: u(b) should be u(1); f(t) should be f(x)
<li>p.128, last 2 eqns: missing factors, should read
\dot{a} = -2ka^3b, and \dot{a}=k_1 a b + k_2 c
<li>p.137, 3rd from bottom line of equations: no plus-or-minus symbol needed
<li>p.138, Ex 2.13: y(0)=1 (rather than 0) should be the first BC
<li>p.139, middle of page: Schrodinger is one word
<li>p.143, 3rd eqn from bottom: `I(lambda) =<'  shouldn't be there
<li>p.143, Eq (2.102): e^{lambda t} should be e^{-lambda t}.
<li>p.143, after (2.102): reference to Figure 2.8 but there is no such figure.
<li>p.215, #7c: Eqn (3.16) should be (4.5).
<li>p.227, 6 lines above (4.16): missing left bracket in (K-lambda.I)
<li>p.227, 5th line: \lambda=0 not \lambda\equiv 0
<li>p.243, #2: cases are not very interesting since never hit an eigenvalue.
I suggest c) $A\mbf{x}-5\mbf{x} = (1, -1/2, 0)^\tbox{T}$ and d)
 $A\mbf{x}-5\mbf{x} = (1, 4, 0)^\tbox{T}$.
<li>p.244, #7d: Currently is same situation as a. I suggest cos(3x) for the
RHS instead, which makes it soluble.
<li>p.244, #4a: u(y) not u(u)
<li>p.245, #14: Operator has zero eigenvalue (infinite multiplicity)
so question should read, determine if it has nonzero eigenvalues, maybe?
<li>p.245, #15: should have k(x,y) rather than k(x,u) under the
integral.
<li>p.246, #22: remove "y(x)="
<li>p.249, #9: lower limit is -\infty? Otherwise solution is u = ce^{2t}
with c=0.
<li>p.343 Eqn (6.3): c is missing
<li>p.363 Thm 6.15: Missing initial "If ..." (unless a claim on existence
is to be made).
<li>p.365 #1: transformation should be w = e^{u/k} instead.
<li>p.373 #11: this problem is duplicate of #13 p.367.
<li>p.382 #3: Need q(x)>0 in order to get positivity in part b.
(p(x)>0 is instead given). Also, Lu = - div(p grad u) + qu, has + sign 
on q.
<li>p.390, middle of 2nd block of eqns: missing factor of i\xi once
integration by parts been done.
<li>p.393, text below 3rd eqn down: a(\xi) should be c(\xi)
<li>p.394, Table 6.2: Delta distribution appears three times,
sinc function missing
a bracket, \delta(t-a) should read \delta(x-a), and F(\xi)G(\xi) should
read \hat{u}(\xi)\hat{v}(\xi).
<li>p.398 #15: an arbitrary constant can be added to the solution.
<li>p.423, above Ex 7.1: definitions of `dispersive' and `hyperbolic'
should be swapped.
