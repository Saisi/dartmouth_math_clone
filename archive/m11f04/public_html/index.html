This course provides an introduction to multivariable mathematics and calculus of vector-valued functions. Topics include coordinates and vectors in R<sup>2</sup> and R<sup>3</sup>, differentiation and integration of parametrically defined functions with interpretations of velocity, acceleration, arclength and curvature. Other topics include iterated, double, triple and surface integrals including change of coordinates. The remainder of the course is devoted to vector fields, line integrals, Green's theorem, curl and divergence, and Stokes' theorem.
Prerequisite: This course is for First-Year Students who have received two terms of AP credit based upon the BC exam. Dist: QDS.

<B>Textbook:</B> <I>Calculus 5e</I>, by James Stewart. The text is available at Wheelock Books.

<B>Graders, Tutors:</B> <BR>
Graduate Student Teaching Assistants (TAs): Marty Malandro, Giulio Genovese, Geoff Goehle.<BR>
Graders: To be identified later.

<P>
<B>Homework:</B> Each week exercises will be assigned that are intended to give you facility with the concepts being developed in class. Most of the homework will be done on-line on the World Wide Web using WeBWorK, a computer program that tells you if an answer you enter is correct, or not. There will be WeBWorK assignments for each class.  These assignments will usually be due two classes after they are assigned. You should check the exact due dates after logging in to webwork.  Late homework, not excused in advance, is not accepted.

<P>In addition to WeBWorK, homework problems in the book will be listed on the syllabus for some classes. We hope to have undergraduate graders who will read them over and indicate if your solution is correct. These problems will not count in your grade, but neglecting them will not help you on the exams.

<P>
<B>Webwork information:</B> If you preregistered for the course, you should have a WeBWorK account by the first day of classes. If you do not have an account by then, tell your instructor so that one can be created; send him e-mail stating your student ID number.  Your initial password is the student ID number. Change it soon, but be sure to remember the new password.

<P>
<B>Tutorials:</B> Tutorials will be run by the TAs every Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday evening from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m. in 102 Bradley. You should be sure to drop in to get your homework questions answered. 

<P>
<B>Examinations:</B> There will be two hour-exams and a final as follows:

<DIR>
Hour-Exam 1: Wednesday, October 20, 3:30-4:45, about half multiple-choice.<BR>
Hour-Exam 2: Wednesday, November 10, 3:30-4:45, about half multiple-choice.<BR>
<Center>[For the hour-exams, Lahr's section will be in 102 Bradley, Chernov's section in 101 Bradley.]</Center><BR>
Final Exam: Tuesday, December 7, 11:30-1:30, multiple choice. [Location to be announced by the Registrar.]
</DIR>

<P>	
<B>Grading:</B> Final letter grades will be determined from the points you earn, as follows: 

<DIR>
Two hour-exams: 100 points each<BR>
Final Exam: 150 points<BR>
WeBWorK homework: 50 points<BR>
<U>Total</U>: 400 points
</DIR>

<P>
<B>Academic Honor Principle:</B> <BR>
On exams: No help is to be given or received. <BR>
On homework: No copying. You may seek help as much as you need. The tutorials are designed for that purpose. You may work with other students except on exams, but must always write up whatever you are working on on your own. Copying from someone else's work, including the sharing of electronic or other files, is not permitted and is a violation of the honor principle.

<P>
<B>Disabilities:</B> We encourage students with documented disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities such as chronic diseases, learning disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities, to discuss possible accommodations with one of your instructors. Students might want to consult as well the Student Disabilities Coordinator, Nancy Pompian, at extension 6-2014, in the Academic Skills Center. In addition to providing information and services, the Center is in charge of registering disabilities and approving accommodations.
