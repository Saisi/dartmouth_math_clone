<H2>Math 5: Aural postings</H2>

<p>
Please post real-world examples of mathematical,
musical, or sonic phenomena we discuss in class, either in the form
of discussion,
articles, links, spectrograms, pictures, 
or best of all <b>sound files</b> (either from recordings, found,
or produced by yourself).
If you post a sound file, please describe what it is, why we should
care, what phenomena it relates to.
You do not have to post every single week, but should aim for 5-7 interesting
posts in total. The more you do (and more thoughtful and interesting!),
the more credit.
We will discuss them at the start of each <b>Monday</b> lecture.
Happy aural hunting!
</p>

<p>
Enter your post in the window below. You <b>must</b> provide your name.
If you don't provide your name and submit the comment,
the comment will <b>disappear</b> from the text field
and you will have to <b>type it again</b>. To avoid frustration
I suggest you compose your comment on a text editor then paste in
when you're ready.
Scroll down to read <A HREF= "index.html#comments_start_here">previous posts</A>.


<p>
For uploading <b>sound files</b> there is a <b>2MB limit</b>, ie
about 2 minutes of MP3 or OGG format, but only 12 seconds of WAV.
Therefore I recommend you use MP3 or OGG (convert using audacity).
In all cases keep them short!
Your uploaded files will remain on the Math Dept server.
Unfortunately you <b>cannot remove</b> a comment or file yourself;
email me if you must have something removed.
We all take it for granted you won't post dumb/offensive material.
</p>

<p>
You may embed HTML in your post such as &lt;BR&gt;, &lt;P&gt;,
<BR>
&lt;B&gt;...&lt;/B&gt;, etc for formatting purposes.
I encourage you to include <b>links</b>
like this: &lt;a href="http://interesting.site.org/"&gt;check it out!&lt;/a&gt;
<BR>
You may also cut from a document and paste into the comments area.

<TD ALIGN=left>After being awakened by my alarm, I started to wonder what exactly was waking me up. My alarm clock has a very harsh tone. I recorded it with audacity and analyzed the frequencies. Just as I expected, there were many higher frequencies. The main frequencies that I found were 836, 3193, 4907, 7104, 9086, and 1112. There is a very loose 3:4:5 ratio found in the last three frequencies, that would imply a fundamental of 2287.6, however the actual heard frequency was approximately half of that.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>A friend passed on this website to me after seeing my pvc pipe flutes.  Check out http://www.oddmusic.com/gallery/, it has all sorts of odd instruments.  Some of the entries include the sea organ, singing river stones (listen to the sound clip!), and my favorite the vienna vegetable orchestra.  You can see pictures of pipes made out of carrots, cucumbers, and peppers.  Apparently the troupe of 10 performs and then turns their crafted instruments into a big soup for the audience.  Check out their sound clip too, it's pretty funky stuff.</TD>

This is a link to an episode of Myth Busters in which they test to see if it is actually possible to break a wine glass using the human voice.  They find the resonant frequency of the glass and experiment with using it to excite the glass enough to break it.  I thought it was really interesting to see the application of resonance, and they discuss a lot of the things we have been going over in lecture.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This sound is the recordings that come from holding a microphone at the openings of each resonating sphere of the Koenig sound analyzer.  The spheres were all excited by the a noise track and in this clip you can hear how each sphere picks out its resonant frequency and creates a recognizable tone with noise</TD>

My buddy showed me this site and it's pretty cool. You need headphones and a quiet room but it plays with the time your ears receive a sound. It gives the illusion that you are in a barbershop. </TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>This is a clip of my Chamber Singers rehearsal, recorded last week in Rollins Chapel.  For this piece, there was a soloist and a chorus, so I thought it would be interesting to analyze a small section of the piece to see whether the soloists' notes come through more clearly in the spectrum than do those of the chorus.  Sure enough, the soloist is singing a high F, and the spectrum shows a peak at 697 Hz, and then another one at the next partial: about 1380 Hz.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>In lieu of an aural posting, I am doing a visual posting - a diagram of a sound phenomena I experienced on Friday afternoon that was so compelling, I could almost see exactly how the sound was moving!

I was walking towards the Green Friday afternoon from the east side of campus.  As I passed between Thornton and Dartmouth Halls, I heard some jazzy folk music coming towards me.  At first I couldn't discern where it was coming from, and then I suddenly had a powerful sense that the sound was coming from my right (see diagram).  I remember wondering, for a brief instant, where the band could possibly be set up, since there's no good spot to do so on the north side of the Green.

Suddenly, I remembered our in-class discussions about reflected sound.  I realized instantly where the music was coming from, because I was now accounting for the equal angles between the reflected sound pulse and me, and between the original sound pulse and the source - Collis porch!  Sure enough, when I finished passing between the two buildings, I heard the sound coming loud and clear from my left, across the Green.

This set-up made for a great sound-mirror!</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>[sorry, thought JB was posting this on Friday]

For our project, JB and myself are going to analyze the acoustics of 4 different buildings/spaces on campus - Leverone Fieldhouse, Thompson Arena, the 1902 room in Baker Library, and the Lobby area of Fairchild - we will be playing a reproducable, identical sound source (probably the alarm button on a megaphone, or a loud cell phone chime) in each space and recording the echo, etc - and analyzing the results - maybe calculate some resonance times? Sky's the limit in math 5. Hopefully those buildings will work, we may need to find some smaller ones. Word!</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Instead of analyzing the acoustics of rooms around campus, I have decided to look more into the history of music theory.  I will primarily focus on the developments in music theory by the Greeks.  I hope to be able to find the history of many of the topics we have studied in class, as well as maybe some other interesting topics relating to math and music.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Term Project

For our term project, we intend to examine the acoustics of several places on campus comprised of different materials, sizes, and shapes.  Using a megaphone which will emit a repeatable, specific sound, we will visit Leverone Field House (steel and windows), Baker Berry's 1902 room (wood), Fairchild Tower (brick and concrete), and Remsen Hockey Rink (ice and steel) to build an analysis of these spaces and the echoes we produce.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>For my project I'm going to do an investigation into a device called a talk box. You're probably familiar with the talk box if you're a Peter Frampton fan as he used it extensively on his live album Frampton Comes Alive. Its basically a an air tight tube which the guitarist puts in his mouth at one end, the tubed taped to a microphone. At the other end, is a pedal box with an input from the guitar signal. It basically uses what we've been talking about with formants and applies it to a guitar signal. The result is sort of a robot sounding synthesis of voice and guitar, its pretty cool. I'm going to look into both the history of this device, and the math and science behind it. </TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>Project Idea:  I originally thought it would be interesting to analyze the accoustics of the Great Hall in Thayer Engineering School.  However, I went and looked at it and realize that it would be insanely difficult since it has so much structure and so many doors and hallways that lead into it.  So, I started researching online to find an interesting instrument to analyze and write a report about its history.  I stumbled across the "Sea Organ" which was originally created in Croatia.  It is basically a set of stairs that is designed so that when the waves crash onto them it plays music.  I've decided to analyze this structure and the history of how the Sea Organ was built.  And, if possible (although I have no idea how difficult the structure is), build a replica of the "Sea Organ".  Attached is a sample of the sounds of the Sea Organ.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This has been taken from the track 'Windowlicker' from the group Aphex Twins. Using Praat, you will see a picture of a spiral. Supposedly, there is a face embedded in the track at 5:27minutes lasting for 10seconds but due to the limitations of Praat - can't see in color, etc... I can't find it. But here is an example of you can convert pictures into sound.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>I hit an upside down stainless steel bowl and it produced a very interesting effect. Zooming in on the graph shows how the sound created pulses as it bounced off the walls of the bowl.  

To measure decay, I examined only the peaks of these minute pulses and found it to be about .036 seconds

The strongest frequencies were all over the place with 552, 764, 1076, and 1480 Hz.  </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is the sound of my metal lamp cover.  The partials were 529 hz, 991 hz, 1989 hz, and 3913 was also strong.  Some of the higher partials were stronger but decayed faster than the main partials and this effect can be heard in the sound clip. I have estimated the decay time to be about .025 seconds.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is the sound of a pan hitting the kitchen floor. The decay time is about 1.1 seconds, the amount of time it takes for the intensity to drop 8.69 dB and for amplitude to drop 0.37.  There are frequency partials at 598, 819, 1343, etc., which indicate the frequency of different nodes since they are not harmonically related. </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is a recording of a spoon striking a wok top.  The decay rate was very rapid (.05 seconds) but a low bass note hung around for a while afterwards, not always picked up by my computer recording.  But if I held the wok to my ear I could hear the bass note really clearly, similar to a tuning fork.  The partials were 126, 344, and 700 (strongly) as well as 1108, 1344, and 1544 (not so strongly). </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is a recording of me hitting a metal cereal bowl with a plastic spoon towards the side of the bowl. If you analyze it with Audacity you can see that it has numerous partials at non-harmonic intervals, thus indicating the presence of multiple modes. According to pratt, the strongest mode is the one at 669 Hz, though there are others which are higher on the Audacity spectrum including 1569 and 1816 Hz. Other partials include 1141, 2424, and 2576 Hz. The overal decay time seems to be about 0.26 seconds.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>I produced this sound by holding my finger on a piano string (C4, equal-tempered frequency of 261.63 Hz) and playing the note normally. Rather than holding my finger at a specific node, which would have produced a harmonic, I isolated the percussive aspect of the piano hammer hitting the string. The decay time for the sound is approximately .034 seconds. There are many partials, but the strongest partials are at 38, 114, 248, 280, 560, 760, 1315, and 2100 Hz. It is important to note that there is no partial present at or around 261.63, the fundamental frequency of the string I used. </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>I got this sound by hitting a metal box. The main partials were at about 600, 1050, 1550, 2270, 2700, 3000, 3200, and 3460 Hz. It was hard to get an accurate decay time because the envelope was not clear.  I would gues it was about .05 sec. Almost all the partials decayed at the same rate except for two. One was the 3460 partial.  The other was about 750 Hz which was not that intense but for some reason lasted the longest by far.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>I tapped my tin whistle with a pencil.  The main partials were at 1784, 3077, 4029, 4820 and 8707 Hz.  One thing that makes determining the decay time difficult is that, upon closer inspection, I found evidence of a flutter echo.  Sound pulses were probably emitted within the tube as well, and the microphone recorded some of the echoes.  However, if I look just at the first sound, the initial amplitude is 0.26; the signal reaches 0.0962 - 37% of 0.26 - at about 0.017 seconds.  This decay time is rather short, and the Q-factor would be short as well.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>I placed my microphone inside my empty nalgene bottle and then hit it 3 times with a pencil in two different locations (side of the bottle, bottom of the bottle).
Suprisingly, both locations have the same component frequencies, but have different strengths depending on the two locations.  The frequencies are: 2325, 2555, 3844, 4011, and 4931.  When I hit it on the side, the higher frequencies were more predominent (mainly 3844 and 4011), whereas when I struck the bottom the lower frequency peaks were higher (2325, 2555).
The decay time is approximately .05 seconds.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>I used a cooking pan and struck the bottom several times with a spoon.  I first hit the middle of the bottom, then various places around the edges of the pan, and then in the middle again.  I wanted to see what different partials would appear if I hit different places on the pan, to see maybe if the modes' shapes could be guessed at.  When I struck in the middle, the partials 467, 930, 1764, 3339, and 4852 Hz. were present.  467 was the weakest of these and 3339 was the strongest.  The hits around the edge of the pan all showed the same partials, including all of the partials from the center hit.  In addition to the already listed partials, there was 2875, 4234, and a very faint 5778 Hz.  The appearance of new partials shows that different modes were excited along the edge of the bottom than in the middle.  You can hear this in the different tones of the two different locations.  I found the decay time for the hits to be 0.0635 seconds.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>This clip is from the beginning of the song "Love like Winter" and it came up on my iPod over the weekend.  I thought it would be fun to try to analyze the steps and to figure out what type of setup created the echo.  Analyzing the sample in Audacity, the echo appears to be a flutter echo, which means the person was walking between two flat and relatively close together surfaces.  It sounds to me that the steps are created by walking down a long hallway or corridor.  Using the formula derived in class and measuring the period in audacity to be around .003 seconds, the walls are approximately .51 meters apart.  In feet, this is only 1.7 feet which would be an extremely narrow hallway.  However, my thought is that our calculation didn't work exactly right because the person was probably walking down the center of the hallway and our calculation was for someone standing up against on of the walls.  If we double it, the hallway is approximately 4 feet which is slightly more reasonable (still narrow, though!)  </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is my alarm clock going off.  I wanted to find out whether the partials would not line up (like a telephone).  However, the signal is indeed periodic, with partials appearing about every 4000 Hz.  I'm guessing that it is high-pitched in order to make sure I wake up every morning!</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>When making a violin, (I used to be a violin maker) one carves the top and back of the instrument and slowly reduces their thicknesses.  As these plates get thinner one holds them at different points and taps on them at other points to hear how clearly they ring and at what pitches.  Determining the pitch can drive one crazy.  Here I recorded the tap tones of the top of a violin I am in the process of building.  The first set of taps is the top vibrating in mode 5, the second set mode 2 and the third set mode 1 (I think Alex is going to talk about modal vibrations at some point).  Looking at the spectrum plots of these tones gives a pretty good understanding of why it's so hard to hear the fundamental pitch -- there are lots of different frequencies (not in Fourier series) competing for ones attention....</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>I play a harmonic on my bass by touching the string just above the 5th fret on the A string and plucking the string. This creates a node at the 5th fret, causing the string to become a standing wave with a wavelength half as long as its entire length and with a frequency of 880 Hz. The next harmonic is played just above the 7th fret on the D string, creating a node at this location and generating a standing wave that also has a frequency of 880 Hz. I then tighten the D string, causing the frequency, and thus the pitch, of the second harmonic I played to increase. As this frequency increases while the first harmonic remains the same, we can hear beats generated that increase in frequency as the two pitches become more different. Then, I re-tune the two strings, causing the beat frequency to decrease as I loosen the D string and bring the two pitches back together. I then strike the two harmonics and loosen the D string further, again the beat frequency increases as the two notes move farther apart in frequency and decreases as they move closer together. This is the standard way of tuning a stringed instrument by ear. When the beats slow down and then disappear you know that the two strings are in tune with one another.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>I chose one of my least favorite noises, the teapot whistle.  I thought maybe I could come to like the noise more if I appreciated it on a musical, instead of purely obnoxious, level.  Analyzing the sound with audacity, I found it is composed of primarialy D9 and D8 pitches.  This is showing the 1:2 ratio of an octave.  The notes have values of 4672 Hz and 9371, very close to a perfect octave.  So my obnoxious teapot is singing a D octave.  </TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>This sound clip starts out with a sample of my bass guitar playing an A2 (110 hz).  A second later, a computer generated sine wave at 110 hz is played along side the guitar sample.  The resulting effect is a superposistion in waves, and since one can hear an oscillating hum this means there is a slight difference in the two frequencies which is forming a beat frequency to occur.  Also, by looking at the superposistion we can tell that the waves did not have the same frequency because they both constructively and destructively interfered.  This therefore shows the A string on my bass guitar is not perfectly tuned.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is the opening of the cello-piano movement of Messiaen's Quartet for the End of Time. For the first note, B4, the first five peaks were, as expected, B4, B5, F#6, B6, and D#7. When the piano enters, the spectrum analysis naturally becomes more complicated, but it is interesting to observe the difference in timbre between the piano's sound and the cello's sound. One important thing to note about the cello's sound is that there is a considerable amount of vibrato; that is, the note seems to oscillate slightly around the pitch, a fact which is shown in the plot spectrum as smaller peaks centered around the main peaks for each note/harmonic. </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>In class, Professor Barnett jingled keys in front of the speaker and it sounded similar to bells. I think one of my favorite sounds is bells. For my first aural posting, I jingled my car keys near the speaker of my computer. I then amplified the audio track with audacity.

After learning about the frequency of sound waves and what it means to amplify a sound, I find it interesting to analyze this audio track. When I amplify it, something inside the computer vertically stretches the sound waves by the percent I indicate. It is fascintating to think sounds reduce to functions that can be manipulated by percentages to create new sounds. The frequency of this audio track is mostly between 4000 Hz and 10000 Hz. </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is a recording of the low E string on my guitar.  Although I tuned the instrument before recording, the Audacity 'spectrum' feature is telling me I really played an F#.  Quite possible.  Regardless of the pitch, this is a good example of a function which decreases in amplitude, has a relatively visable period (especially just after the initial plucking of the string), and has a pitch which remains pretty constant.  </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is me singing a pitch on the syllable "Do," which I am using to illustrate the relationship between frequency and pitch.  I determined pitch by two different methods: one by listening, and one by working with the graph of the note on audacity.

After singing the note, I compared it to a note on my tin whistle, and determined by listening that the note I had sung was G4.

I then zoomed in on the graph and determined that the length of the signal's period was in the range of .0025 to .0026 seconds.  Thus, by 1/.00255, the frequency was 392.16 Hz.  I plugged this number into our logarithmic equation, and determined that this pitch was almost exactly two semitones below A4 (-1.99), which is - as expected - G4.

Another interesting thing I noticed about the graph, pertaining to this week's material, is that - especially near the beginning, when the tone is clearest - it looks almost exactly like the graph on today's Fourier Series worksheet: the graph of g(x) = sin(200 pi t) + sin (400 pi t).

Both the graph and the clear timbre of the tone suggest that the signal's harmonic content includes one b1, and one b2.  By the relation w = 2 pi f, I would thus suggest that the function of this tone is g(x) = sin(784.33 pi t) + sin (1568.64 pi t).</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is an audio clip I found of 3 thunder claps in a row.  The immediate thing I noticed and found interesting about this sound clip is that it shows a periodicity of about 3 seconds.  I found it pretty amazing for nature to be so periodic when storms seem by definition so chaotic.  
The other effect I noticed in the clip is the obvious fact of the amplitude change.  Since it gets much louder when the thunder clap occurs the amplitude would increase dramatically when that happens.  The amplitude decreases rapidly after the initial "boom" of the thunder but is still fluctuating with the crackling between the claps.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Here is a train whistle I recorded near White River Junction, VT, a few days ago (I was indoors so you can hear some background noise, and rumble). There's a lot going on here: there are 3 musical notes, and the chord seems to start out at C4-E4-A4, but the A4 drifts up to Bb4 by the end (moving from a minor to dominant-seventh feel, if you know harmony). I wonder why? Something to do with steam pressure changing? Each note has a harmonic series. We'll learn more about all these notes and concepts soon!
