<li>Homework will be assigned weekly and will be due <b>at the beginning</b>

  during the x-hour for discussion.</li><br />


<li>All homework assignments will be posted on the course assignment's 
<a href="assignments.php.html" class="palebg">web page</a>.</li><br />

<li>Late homework is rarely accepted, and never without prior
  arrangement with the instructor.  Starting assignments early will
  assure you have at least some work to submit for grading. </li><br />

<li>Homework is to be written <b>neatly</b> using one side of 8 1/2 x 11 inch
paper. <b>Do not</b> use paper from a spiral notebook unless you can tear off
the ragged edge. All papers are to be stapled.</li><br />

<li><b>Use English.</b>  If you can't read your solutions aloud as fluently as
  if you were reading your textbook, try using nouns and verbs in your
  write ups! Give references for theorems or propositions you use from
  the text and class.</li><br />

<li>Consult the honor principle (below) as it applies to this course. </li>

</table>
<p>

<!-- Honor Principle details -->

<p>
<b>On Homework:</b> Students are encouraged to work
 together to do homework problems. What is important is a student's
 eventual understanding of homework problems, and not how that is
 achieved. The honor principle applies to homework in the following
 way. <b>What a student turns in as a homework solution is to be his or
 her own understanding of how to do the problem. Students must state
 what sources they have consulted, with whom they have collaborated,
 and from whom they have received help.</b> Students are discouraged from
 using solutions to problems that may be posted on the web, and as
 just stated, must reference them if they use them. The solutions you
 submit must be written by you alone. Any copying (electronic or
 otherwise) of another person's solutions, in whole or in
 part, is a violation of the Honor Code.</p>

<p>Moreover, if in working with someone they have provided you with an
important idea or approach, they should be explicitly given credit in
your writeup. Hints I give in office hours need not be cited. Note: It
is not sufficient to annotate your paper with a phrase like ``I worked
with Joe on all the problems.'' Individual ideas are to be credited at
each instance; they represent intellectual property.</p>

<p>

<b>On Exams:</b> <b>Students may not receive assistance of
any kind from any source (living, published, electronic, etc), except
the professor, and may not give assistance to anyone.  Matters of
clarification are to be left to the professor.</b>
</p>

<p>If you have any questions as to whether some action would be
acceptable under the Academic Honor Code, please speak to me, and I
will be glad to help clarify things. It is always easier to ask
beforehand.
</p>

<p>


Tutorial assistance for this course, that is, help with your homework,
will be available in 102 Bradley, Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays
evenings 7 - 10pm.  Tutorials will begin on Thursday, September 26.
<P>

Also note that the Tutor Clearinghouse will have private one-on-one
tutors available for Math 8.  The tutors are recruited on the basis
that they have done well in the subject, and are trained by the
Academic Skills Center.  If a student receives financial aid, the
College will pay for three hours of tutoring per week.  If you would
like to have a tutor, please go to 301 Collis and fill out an
application as early in the term as possible.

<p>

<!-- Disabilities statement -->

<p> I encourage any students with
disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities such as chronic
diseases and learning disabilities, to discuss appropriate
accommodations with me, which might help you with this class, either
after class or during office hours. Dartmouth College has an active
program to help students with disabilities, and I am happy to do
whatever I can to help out, as appropriate.  
</p>

<p>Any student with a documented disability requiring academic
adjustments or accommodations is requested to speak with me by the end
of the second week of the term. All discussions will remain
confidential, although the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/" class="palebg">
Academic Skills Center
</a>  may be consulted to
verify the documentation of the disability and advise on an
appropriate response to the need. It is important, however, that you
talk to me soon, so that I can make whatever arrangements might be
needed in a timely fashion.
</p>

<p>Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that
occur during this academic term.  If you have a religious observance
that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with
me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss
appropriate accommodations.
</p>
