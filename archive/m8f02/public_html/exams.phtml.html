<!--H2><A HREF="exams.phtml.html#calculator_policy">Calculator Policy</A></H2-->
<A NAME="calculator_policy"></A>
<H3> Calculator Policy on Exams</H2>
First, it should be understood that exams are designed so that
calculators are of little use.  In fact, they may be counter
productive:  if an answer is sqrt(2), and you list 1.414, you are
wrong.  If you find yourself inseparable from your calculator, you may bring
it, but subject to the following conditions:
<P>
You may only use the very basic functions of your calculator.  The
following are explicitly <B>prohibited</B>:
<UL>
<LI>Using any graphing capabilities of your calculator (no plotting of
graphs, direction fields, etc)
<LI>Using any symbolic manipulation capabilities (symbolic
integration, differentiation, mulitplication of polynomials or complex
numbers)
<LI>Using your calculator to store formulas or other crib notes
</UL>

<B>Deviation from this policy will
be considered a violation of the honor code.</B>
