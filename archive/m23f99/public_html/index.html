<h2>Math 23 (Differential Equations) - Fall 1999</h2>
<hr>
<b>Final Exam:</b> Saturday, December 4, 1999 from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. in Bradley 102 (which is right 
down the hall from our usual classroom)
<p>
<b>Office Hours between now and the final:</b> (NOTE:  all of the following is potentially
subject to change.  In the event that I have to alter my office hours, I will do my best to post
the updates here.) I should be in my office from noon to 3 on Wednesday, from 8 a.m. to noon on
Thursday, and from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Friday.  On Wednesday and Thursday, I'll handle people on a
first-come first-served basis.  On Friday, I will give priority to math 9 students during
even-numbered hours (8-9, 10-11, etc.) and math 23 students during odd-numbered hours (9-10, 11-12, 
etc.).  Drop by anytime, but be aware that math 9 students have the right to boot you out during
even hours.
<p>
Update:  I will be gone from 10-11 on Thursday.  So that leaves 8-10 and 11-12.

<P>
It looks like I will not have time to post answers to the practice exam.  Note that many of them
can be checked using Maple, or by direct substitution.  I have arranged a little area where you
can post your solution and/or questions and talk amongst yourselves.  Click <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m23f99/comments/comments/">here</a>.  I may or may not have any time late tonight to answer
questions, but maybe some of your classmates will help out.

<b>Official office hours</b>: MWF 1:00-2:30
<p>
<b>Other office hours</b>: Email me to set up an appointment (this
will usually work) or just drop by the office (this plan is a bit riskier).

Problems</I> (Sixth Edition), by Boyce and DiPrima
<p>
<b>Maple</b>:  We will be using the software package <i>Maple</i> from
time to time.  If you are not familiar with Maple, <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/software">here is some information</a> to get you started.  
<p>
<b>Grade</b>: Your grade will be determined as follows:
<pre>
Category                 Weight          
----------------------------------       
homework and quizzes      15%            
2 mid-term exams          25% each       
final exam                35%            
</pre>
<p>
<b>Exams</b>:  The date, time, and format of all 3 exams are yet to be
determined.  Expect the first mid-term sometime around October 15, and
the second sometime around November 12.
<p>
<b>Makeup policy</b>: Homework will be assigned (almost) every class
period, and will be due at the next class meeting.  <i>No late
homework will be accepted for any reason</i>, but your three lowest
homework scores will be dropped before computing your grade.  Thus you
may miss up to three homework assignments without penalty.
<p>
Makeup tests will only be given in case of legitimate emergencies.  
<p>
<b>Honor policy</b>: The official university honor policy will be
followed.  In addition consider the following points:
<ul>
<li>Collaboration is encouraged during the process of
thinking about homework problems, but is not acceptable while writing
up your final solutions.  That is, working together on homework is
fine, but copying is not.  
<li>No collaboration of any form is acceptable during exams.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Students with disabilities</b>:  I encourage students with
disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases
and learning disabilities, to discuss with me any appropriate accommodations
that might be helpful.
