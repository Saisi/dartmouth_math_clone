equations. (Sections 2.5 and 2.6)  

<P>

<UL><LI>Suppose you like to drink your coffee at 95 degrees, so you set
  a 150 degree cup of coffee outside (where it's 45 degrees).  2
  minutes later, the coffee is down to 115.  How long until it's at
  your desired temperature of 95?

<LI>Suppose a 500 gallon tank initially contains 100 gallons of pure
  water.  At time <I>t</I>=0, salt water (consisting of one-half pound of
  salt per gallon) begins to enter the tank at a rate of 3 gallons per
  minute.  The well-stirred mixture is drained at a rate of 2 gallons
  per minute.  Find an expression for the amount of salt in the tank
  at any time <IMG

<B>2.5 number 8:</B> A young person with no initial capital invests <I>k</I> dollars per
year at an annual interest rate <I>r</I>.  Assume that investments are made continuously
and that interest is compounded continuously.

<UL><LI>Determine the sum <I>S</I>(<I>t</I>) accumulated at any time <I>t</I>.

<LI>If <I>r</I>=7.5%, determine <I>k</I> so that one million dollars will be available for
retirement in 40 years.

<LI>If <I>k</I>=2000 dollars per year, determine the interest rate <I>r</I> that must be
obtained to have one million dollars available in 40 years.

<P>
<B>2.5 number 21:</B> Suppose that a body with temperature 85 degrees is discovered
at midnight, and that the ambient temperature is a constant 70 degrees.  The body
is removed quickly (assume instantly) to the morgue, where the ambient temperature
is 40 degrees.  After one hour, the body temperature is found to be 60 degrees.
Estimate the time of death.

<P>
<B>2.5 number 27:</B> Suppose a room containing 1200 cubic ft of air is originally
free of carbon monoxide.  Beginning at time <I>t</I>=0, cigarette smoke containing 4%
carbon monoxide (CO) is introduced into the room at a rate of 0.1 cubic ft per
minute, and the well-circulated mixture is allowed to leave the room at the same
rate.

<UL><LI>Find an expression for the concentraion <I>x</I>(<I>t</I>) of carbon monoxide in the room
at any time <I>t</I> &gt; 0.

<LI>Extended exposure to a CO concentration as low as 0.00012 is harmful.  Find
the time required until this level is reached.

(You may need to read go back to your calc book to review some definitions for
these next two)

<B>2.6 number 3:</B> Consider the DE 
<!-- MATH
 $y'=y(y-1)(y-2)$
 -->
<I>y</I>'=<I>y</I>(<I>y</I>-1)(<I>y</I>-2).  Find all equilibrium
solutions, and classify each one as asmptotically stable or unstable.

<P>
<B>2.6 number 10:</B> Consider the DE <I>y</I>'=<I>y</I>(1-<I>y</I><SUP>2</SUP>).  Find all equilibrium
solutions, and classify each one as asmptotically stable, unstable, or semistable.

<P>
<B>2.6 number 18:</B> Suppose that the population <I>y</I> of fish in a certain area of
the ocean can be modelled by the DE 
<!-- MATH
 $y' = r(1-\frac{y}{K})y - Ey$
 -->

 ALT="$y' = r(1-\frac{y}{K})y - Ey$">,
where <I>K</I> and
<I>r</I> are positive constants and <I>E</I> is a positive constant (with units 1/time) that
measures
the effort being made to catch these fish by local fishermen.

<UL><LI>Show that if <I>E</I> &lt; <I>r</I>, there are two equilibrium solutions, <I>y</I><SUB>1</SUB> = 0 and 
<!-- MATH
 $y_2

 -->
<I>y</I><SUB>2</SUB>

<LI>Show that <I>y</I>=<I>y</I><SUB>1</SUB> is unstable and that <I>y</I>=<I>y</I><SUB>2</SUB> is stable.

<LI>A sustainable yield <I>Y</I> of the fishery is a rate at which fish can be caught
indefinitely.  It is the product of the effort <I>E</I> and the stable population <I>y</I><SUB>2</SUB>.
Find <I>Y</I> as a function of the effort <I>E</I>.  This graph is known as the yield-effort
curve.
