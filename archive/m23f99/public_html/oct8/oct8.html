<B>Covered today:</B> Homogeneous 2nd order constant coefficient DEs for which the
characteristic
equation has complex conjugate solutions.  We now know (but still haven't proven) the
solution to any homogeneous 2nd order constant coefficient DE.  We'll prove that we
actually have the general solution next week.

<P>
<B>For next time:</B> 3.4 - 7,11,17,22 and 3.8 - 5,9 (for these last two, simply set up
and solve the DE - don't worry about the quasi-frequency and the quasi-period and
whatnot (yet)).  Also, do the following problem:  assume you have a
spring-mass system which is critically damped.  Suppose the mass starts at
equilibrium and you give it an initial velocity (in either direction).
Prove that the mass will never return to its equilibrium.

<P>
<B>Transparencies from class:</B> (these were taken almost verbatim from the more
complete discussion in section 3.8 of your book)

<P>
Consider a spring (which we'll assume to be weightless) whose
natural length is <I>l</I>.  Suppose that we hang a mass <I>m</I> at the
end of the spring, and this elongates the spring by <I>L</I> units.
There are now two forces acting on the mass:  its weight, which
is acting downward, and a spring force <I>F</I><SUB><I>s</I></SUB> which is acting
upward.  Hooke's law states that (for reasonably small values
of <I>L</I>, which we'll assume we have at all times) the spring force
is proportional to the elongation of the spring.  The constant of
proportionality <I>k</I> is called the <I>spring constant</I>.

<P>
Assuming downward is the positive direction, explain why <I>mg</I>-<I>kL</I>=0.

<P>
We will now consider what happens to the position of this mass
at the end of this spring if it is initially displaced, given an
initial velocity, and/or acted on by an outside force.   Let <I>u</I>(<I>t</I>)
denote the position of the mass at time <I>t</I>, with <I>u</I>=0 corresponding
to the equilibrium position of the mass (i.e. when <I>u</I>=0 the spring is
<I>L</I>+<I>l</I> units long), and with <I>u</I>(<I>t</I>) being measured positive downward.

<P>
There are four forces acting on the mass at any time <I>t</I>.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>the weight of the mass;
<DT>2.
<DD>the spring force <I>F</I><SUB><I>s</I></SUB>(<I>t</I>), which is proportional to the total
elongation <I>L</I>+<I>u</I>(<I>t</I>) of the spring (with constant of proportionality
equal to
the spring constant <I>k</I>) and always acts to restore the spring to
its equilibrium position.  Show that 
<!-- MATH
 $F_s(t)=-k(L+u(t))$
 -->
<I>F</I><SUB><I>s</I></SUB>(<I>t</I>)=-<I>k</I>(<I>L</I>+<I>u</I>(<I>t</I>)).  Why is the
sign in front always the same despite the fact that this force is
acting in different directions at different times?
<DT>3.
<DD>the resistive force (or damping force) <I>F</I><SUB><I>d</I></SUB>(<I>t</I>), which is
proportional to the speed of the mass.  Show that 
<!-- MATH
 $F_d(t)=-\gamma u'(t)$
 -->

is a positive constant called the <I>damping constant</I>.
Again, you should convince yourself that this one formula is valid
at all times whether the mass is moving upward or downward.
<DT>4.
<DD>an applied external force <I>F</I><SUB><I>e</I></SUB>(<I>t</I>).  
</DL>

<P>
Prove that, if there is no external force, this system is described by
a homogeneous 2nd-order linear constant-coefficient DE (with nonnegative
coefficients).

<P>
Suppose a mass weighing 5 pounds is hooked to a spring and stretches it 2 inches.
Assuming no air resistance, if this mass is pushed up 1 foot and then released, find the
function <I>u</I> describing the position of the mass at time <IMG
