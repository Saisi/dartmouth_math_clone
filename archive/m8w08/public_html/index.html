<ul><li>The final exam is Tuesday, March 11 from 3-6 pm in Filene Auditorium, Moore Hall.</li></ul>

<ul><li>The final exam will cover the material from midterms 1 and 2 as well as sections 15.3-15.7, except for portions explicitly excluded on the syllabus (and there will be no graphs on the exam, nor do you need to know Taylor's Inequality).  As of now, you need to know your trigonometric identities (including half- and double-angle formulas) and the basic MacLaurin series from midterm 2.  You also need to have the Second Derivatives Test memorized.  The exam is approximately half material from the first and second midterms and half material you have not yet been tested on.  As always, <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/courses/by-course/index.phtml?s=CIN">previous course webpages</a> are accessible from the math department web site.  Note not many have final exams available; here are <a href="../../m8w04/public_html/exams.html">three</a> <a href="../../m8f04/public_html/files/syl.html">that</a> <a href="../../m8s05/public_html/exams.htm">do.</a></li></ul>

<ul>
<li>There is a <a

<ul><li>If you wish to see old Math 8 exams, you may visit old Math 8 webpages from the math department's list of <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/courses/by-course/index.phtml?s=CIN">course web pages indexed by course number</a>.  You should be warned that the material of Math 8 (and the order in which it is covered) changes from term to term and different instructors have different expectations of their students.</li></ul>

<ul>  
<li>Homework sets will be assigned for each class and will normally be in two parts (see the <a href="M8w08SyllabusHmwk.html">course assignment webpage</a>). The part to be submitted is due before the beginning of the next class period. The second part is not to be turned in, but some complete solutions are available via the web (see below).</li></ul>

<ul><li>The graded portion of each homework assignments will be submitted via the web using <a href="webwork.html">WeBWorK</a>. If you do not receive an e-mail assigning you a login name and password for WeBWorK, then you should contact your instructor via e-mail as soon as possible: <a href="mailto:rebecca.weber@dartmouth.edu">rebecca.weber@dartmouth.edu</a> or <a href="mailto:meera.mainkar@dartmouth.edu">meera.mainkar@dartmouth.edu</a>.</li>  

<li>Please note that WeBWorK will <i>not</i> accept assignments past the closing date. Typically, assignments for Monday lectures will close Wednesday afternoon, assignments for Wednesday lectures will close Friday afternoon and assignments for the Friday lectures will close Monday afternoon. There will be appropriate adjustments for holidays.</li></ul>

<ul><li>The second part of the assignment will consist mostly of odd numbered problems from the text. You can login to <a href="http://hotmath.com">http://hotmath.com</a> (using the password supplied in lecture) to see complete solutions of many of these problems.  Note that hotmath currently only has 5th edition answers available.  Many of these correspond to sixth edition problems; we have provided a <a href="translation.html">translation page</a> for the practice problems.</li>
</ul>

<ul>  
<li> <b>Tutorial</b> assistance for this course - that is, help with your homework - will be available Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings 7 - 9pm, in Kemeny 007.  Tutorials will begin on Tuesday, January 8 and run through Sunday, March 9.  Our tutors are <a href="mailto:Amir.Barghi@Dartmouth.EDU">Amir Barghi</a> and <a href="mailto:Avram.M.Gottschlich@dartmouth.edu">Avram Gottschlich</a>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li> Also note that the Tutor Clearinghouse may have private one-on-one tutors available for Math 8. The tutors are students who have taken the course and have done well in it, and are trained by the Academic Skills Center. If a student receives financial aid, the College will pay for three hours of tutoring per week.
