What is WeBWorK? </h3>  <em>WeBWorK</em> is a system that allows students to do theirhomework in an interactive web-based environment. <br>  <br>Using <em>WeBWorK</em>, students may try to answer homework problemsmore than once. After each try, a message appears telling the studentwhether the answer is correct or not. This provides immediate feedbackto the students, allows them to discover what they did wrong, andhopefullyallows them to understand the topic of the question better. <br>  <br>Each <em>WeBWorK</em> problem set is individualized. Each student hasa different version of a problem generated from a fixed template; forexample the numerical values in the formulas may be slightly different.  <p> </p>  <h3> II. How anybody can try out WeBWorK</h3>  <p> Anyone with an internet connection can try out WeBWorK by following the directions in Part III below. Use <strong>practice1</strong> as the <strong>login name</strong> and <strong>000-00-000a</strong> as the <strong>password</strong>. To see different problems, you can login as practice2, practice3, or practice4 and use the the passwords 000-00-000b, 000-00-000c, etc.</p>  <p> </p>  <h3> III. How to use WeBWorK to do your homework</h3>  <p> Using <em>WeBWorK</em> is quite simple.Below are the basic steps on how to get started.<br>  <br>  <strong>NOTE:</strong> Most pages of <em>WeBWorK</em> also containdirections. Therefore, if you are ever unsure of what you should do,try reading the directions and descriptions on the page at which youare looking.<br>  </p>  <ol>    <li>You can use any computer with a browser like Netscape or MSIE.In general, it is not possible to use a text-based browser like lynxsince most of the mathematics is rendered using a graphic format. </li>    <li>Open Netscape and go to the main <em>WeBWorK</em> page, <a href="http://webwork.dartmouth.edu/webwork2">http://webwork.dartmouth.edu/webwork2</a>.<br>    </li>    <li>On that page you will see names of current <em>WeBWorK</em>courses. Find the name of your course and click on it. </li>    <li>This will get you to the main page of your course. This pageincludes necessary information about logging in.<br>To log in, click on the 'Login' button. </li>    <li>This will take you to a login page. Enter your login name andpassword, and click on the 'Continue' button.<br>Your <strong>login name</strong> is the usually just your last name,followed possibly by a digit for people in the class with the same lastname (e.g. smith, smith2, ...)). Possible exceptions include compoundlast name like "den Hartog" or "De La Huerta" which would be renderedHartog and Huerta respectively. <br>Your initial <strong>password</strong> is (unless you gave mesomething else) your six-character student ID ``number''. </li>    <li>If your login is incorrect, you will be told so, and you canreturn to the login page and try again. </li>    <li>If you are registered for the course, you should receive andemail from your instructor confirming your login and password. <br>If your login is correct you will see a page where you can dofollowing:      <ul type="">        <li><strong>Look at and do the problems in a set via Netscape.</strong><br>To do the first days assignment, for example, click on the line in thebox that starts with '22Sept04'.<br>On each line in the box, where all the sets are listed, after the setnumber, you can see whether the set is open or closed. If the set isopen, that means that when you solve a problem, it will be countedtowardsyour grade. If the set is closed, you can still solve problems, butyourresults will not be recorded. <br>After the indication of whether the set is open or closed, thereis additional information about the due date (if the set is open), orwhether the answers are available (if the set is closed).<!-- When the answers are available, you have the option of  looking at correct answers when viewing a problem.-->        </li>        <li><strong>Get a printout of the problem set.</strong><br>To print out 22Sept04, for example, click the box next to it (and anyother set that has a box next to it) and click the downloadbutton. Your browser should then be able to handle the pdffile. If not, any of thecomputer consultants should be able to help you with this kind ofproblem.        </li>        <li><strong>Look at a summary of your WeBWorK homework scores.</strong><br>Click on <em>grades</em> on the left column.<br>        </li>      </ul>    </li>    <li>If you are printing out a problem set or looking at a summaryof your homework scores, you are done. If you are viewing a problem setvia Netscape, you will see a page with the problems in the set youchose. To view and/or answer a problem, click on theproblem. Once you choose a problem and click on it, you will see thetext of the problem with boxes foryour answers. Enter your answers and click on the 'Submit Answer'button. If you are working on a problem set that is already closed, youwill have the option to see the correct answer or a solution if one isavailable (currently only a few problems have solutions available). Tosee the correct answer and/or solution, just check the box(es) andclick on the 'Submit Answer' button (you do not have to enter an answerto see the correct answer or solution). Once you have submitted ananswer, you will be told whether your answer is correct or not. If not,you can try again. After you've tried a problem, you can either go tothe next problem, the previous problem, or see the list of the problemsagain. </li>    <li>If you want to check the status of your problems (e.g. todouble check that your answers have been recorded), use the "Prob.List"button at the top of the page to see the problem list page. </li>    <li> When you are finished, log out using the "Logout" buttonat the bottom of the page. </li>    <li>That's all, folks! </li>  </ol>  <h3> IV. Important facts to know </h3>  <p> </p>  <ul>    <li><strong>What to do if you have problems with WeBWorK:</strong><br>      <ul>        <li>If you have a problem logging in, contact your instructor. </li>        <li>If you have a problem printing out a set, ask a consultantat a computer lab. If you don't get sufficient help, contact yourinstructor or TA. </li>        <li>If you have questions on specific homework problems or ifyou have comments about <em>WeBWorK</em> that you think can help usmake <em>WeBWorK</em> better, click on the 'Feedback' buttonon any of the pages of <em>WeBWorK</em>. </li>      </ul>    </li>    <li>If you are logged on to <em>WeBWorK</em> for longer that 30minutes without any activity, you will be asked to log in again. Thisis a security measure. You can resume your work after you loggedback in. All your results from the last log-in will be saved. </li>  </ul></blockquote><p> </p><p><br></p></body></html>
