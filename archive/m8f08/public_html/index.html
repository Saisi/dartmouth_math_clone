<ul><li>The Math 8 Final Exam will be Saturday, December 6, 3:00-6:00 PM, in Murdough Center Cook Auditorium (in Tuck).  The final is cumulative, covering the sections of chapters 8 and 12-15 that are on the syllabus.</li></ul>

<ul><li>We've decided to make your final exam available ahead of time for studying purposes.  You may download it <a href="m8final-one-question.pdf">here</a>. *** </li></ul>

<ul><li>Tutorial will run all week: November 30, December 2, and December 4.  Rebecca has her usual 10-11 Tu/Th office hours as well as office hours 10-12 Friday.</li></ul>

<ul><li>There is an <a href="m8w08final.pdf">additional old final</a> available for practice.  <a href="m8w08final-soln.pdf">Solutions</a> (corrected 12/5 8:30 am).</li></ul>

<ul><li>If you wish to see old Math 8 exams, you may visit old Math 8 webpages from the math department's list of <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/courses/by-course/index.phtml?s=CIN">course web pages indexed by course number</a>.  You should be warned that the material of Math 8 (and the order in which it is covered) changes from term to term and different instructors have different expectations of their students.  Not many have final exams available; here are <a href="../../m8w04/public_html/exams.html">three</a> <a href="../../m8f04/public_html/files/syl.html">that</a> <a href="../../m8s05/public_html/exams.htm">do.</li></ul>

<!--<ul><li><font color="darkred"><b>Important</b></font>: if you did not get an email from Webwork, write your professor with your Dartmouth ID to request an account.  If you transfer from a different course (such as 3 or 11) which uses Webwork, your account does <em>not</em> transfer with you: send an email so we can add you to the 8 list.</li></ul>-->

<ul><li>There is a <a href="http://www.pierce.ctc.edu/dlippman/g1/GrapherLaunch.html">Javascript graphing applet</a> by David Lippman available.  It allows you to graph in 2 or 3 dimensions and to rotate graphs to view them from multiple perspectives.</li></ul>

<ul><li>There is a self-study <a href="m8prep.pdf">preparatory unit</a> available (pdf).</li></ul>

<ul><li><a href="m8f08mt1ans.pdf">Answers</a> to the first midterm (pdf).  Note there is an error: 11(c) should say "yes" instead of "no", with the explanation as written.</li></ul>

<ul><li>*** Note: we would neither post your actual final to the webpage ahead of time nor make it a single 200-point problem.</li></ul>

<ul>  
<li>Homework sets will be assigned for each class and will normally be in two parts (see the <a href="syllabus.html">course assignment webpage</a>). The part to be submitted is due before the beginning of the next class period. The second part is not to be turned in, but some complete solutions are available via the web (see below).</li></ul>

<ul><li>The graded portion of each homework assignments will be submitted via the web using <a href="webwork.html">WeBWorK</a>. If you do not receive an e-mail assigning you a login name and password for WeBWorK, then you should contact your instructor via e-mail as soon as possible: <a href="mailto:rebecca.weber@dartmouth.edu">Rebecca Weber</a> or <a href="mailto:vincent.vatter@dartmouth.edu">Vincent Vatter</a>.</li>  

<li>Please note that WeBWorK will <i>not</i> accept assignments past the closing date. Typically, assignments for Monday lectures will close Wednesday afternoon, assignments for Wednesday lectures will close Friday afternoon and assignments for the Friday lectures will close Monday afternoon. There will be appropriate adjustments for holidays.</li></ul>

<ul><li>The second part of the assignment will consist mostly of odd numbered problems from the text. You can login to <a href="http://hotmath.com">http://hotmath.com</a> (using the password supplied in lecture) to see complete solutions of many of these problems.  Answers for both the 5th and 6th editions of Stewart are available.  This was not formerly the case, so if you are working from the fifth edition, we have provided a <a href="translation.html">translation page</a> for the practice problems (those which correspond to 5th edition problems).</li>
</ul>

<ul>  
<li> <b>Tutorial</b> assistance for this course - that is, help with your homework - will be available Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings 7-9pm, in Carpenter 013.  Tutorials will begin on Sunday, September 28 and run through Tuesday, December 2.  Our tutors are <a href="mailto:Daniel.Fontaine@Dartmouth.EDU">Dan Fontaine</a> and <a href="mailto:Elizabeth.Gillaspy@dartmouth.edu">Elizabeth Gillaspy</a>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li> Also note that the Tutor Clearinghouse may have private one-on-one tutors available for Math 8. The tutors are students who have taken the course and have done well in it, and are trained by the Academic Skills Center. If a student receives financial aid, the College will pay for three hours of tutoring per week. If you would like to have a tutor, please <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/tutors/index.html">click here</a> for more information.<br></li>
