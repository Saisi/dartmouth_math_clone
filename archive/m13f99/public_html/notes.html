<P><B>Adams, Calculus 4<SUP>th</SUP>. Ed.</B></P>

<P><B>We will review briefly chapter 10, then cover most of chapters
11-15 as well as chapter 16.3.</B></P>

<P><B><U>Homework</U>:</B></P>

<P><B>Homework will be collected at the beginning of each class
meeting. The homework will consist of problems from earlier or
current chapters. Some homework might even include problems from a
subsequent chapter as a preparation for the material to be covered in
class. I will give a bonus problems as well. Please staple your
homework. You should write your solution clearly and show all your
work process. You are encouraged to work together on the problem but
each student should write his/her <U>own </U>solution. As part of the
honor system, please write on the top of your homework the name of
the student(s) with whom you worked.</B></P>

<P><B>You are expected to read the text in advance before the class
and try to solve some problems from the new material. It will be
easier for you to follow the class and you will have a better
understanding of the material.</B></P>
