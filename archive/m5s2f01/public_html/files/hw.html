Our class has officially shifted gears: we are now in <b> project
mode</b>. No
more journals will be assigned and next week's quiz will be the last.  On
Tuesday November 20 by 12:50 a draft of your
project will be due. <b> This draft will be worth 10 percent of your
grade! </b>
Before Monday November 19  each group will meet with an instructor
to discuss the nature of what we expect from them with regards to their
group's project draft.    

<hr>
<b> Week 8:</b>
<p>
Notice your project draft is due on Tuesday November 20 by 12:50.  This
extension has been made so that you have an opportunity to  ask us
questions about how to analyze your data. With this said I state the
following WARNING: the draft's grade will suffer most if the analysis is
weak AND you failed to try and get help; so if you are having problems be
sure and see   us!    Monday Office hours Greg 1:30-5:30 and Jim
3:00-4:30.  You can stop by at any time but priority will be given to
students who make appointments before class meets on Monday.

Project sharpening week.  Monday: the chi^2 test (the final
example in class was done incorrectly, here it is done
<a
href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m5s2f01/files/cor.html">
correctly  </a>. This will also provide you with another example of using
the chi^2 test. Wednesday: more sophisticated uses of our basic hypothesis
tests day via the Coke-Pepsi Challenge.  Rough drafts will be
returned.  Friday: a further look at
the methods and results from the coke Pepsi challenge as well as more
a more detailed look at correlations and histograms via you class
<a

include a discussion about
how to report if a correlation is significant.  
<p>
Schedule:  The Chance Fair will be in 102 Bradley Hall from 1:30-2:30
on Wednesday December 5, at which point you will unveil your poster board 
presentations to the world. If you do not want to present at this time you 
may instead give a ten minute in class discussion about
your project on Monday December 3rd,
which still must include a poster board 
that will be
displayed at the fair
in your absence.  E-mail Professor Leibon if you have any questions.  The
written final project itself must be turned in sometime before

On Friday evaluations were handed out.  If you missed Friday's lecture and
would like to give us some feed back (which we'd appreciate)   
then please see  Betty Harrington in 301 Bradley hall in order to receive
a "Math 5, Chance" evaluation form, and  return  the filled out form
back to Betty.
