<b> An overview. </b>
</center>

<p>
In this course we will use current events and personal experiences to
examine various
statistical and probabilistic concepts.  By the end of the
course, you will be expected to be able to critically
analyze the statistics you come across in your
day-to-day life and understand how they may have been
manipulated. In addition, you will ultimately produce
statistical information of your own, complete
with analysis.

<p>
We may view statistics as the organization and analysis of data. 
The following quantity would be an example of a statistic: The percentage
of people in the US who own a pinball machine.  There are several useful
statistics which we will explore  in this course including the
average, the standard error, and the correlation coefficient.  Sometimes a
statistic is best understood with a picture as opposed to a number and we
will study such visual aids including the histogram, the scatter plot,
and the regression line.


 <p>

Probability we may view as  an attempt to understand
randomness.  For example with probability one might try and  make
sense of the following question:  If you chose a person in the US at
random, what is the chance that they own a pinball machine?  
We will explore several probabilistic concepts 
including that of a model, the expected value, the variance,
a confidence interval, and the fundamental mysteries of
probability; along with certain explicit models including the binomial
model and the models which arise in various gambling situations.

<p>

Many of the issues explored in the Chance course will lie at the
intersection of statistics and probability.
For example you might interview 1,000 US citizens and ask them "Do you own
a pinball machine?" and then collect the following statistic: the
percentage of  these 1,000 people who own a pinball machine.    Suppose 8%
of those interviewed  answered yes.  With what right do you have to claim
that 8% of the US population owns a pinball machine? To answer this one
has to understand how to give a statistics meaning with probability, and
this can be quite a tricky business.  Often in your life information in
this form has been presented to you and it is likely that have and will 
make decisions based on such information.  The primary goal of this course
to be able to better understand such information, which will hopefully
allow you  to make better educated decisions in situations where statistics
arise.
