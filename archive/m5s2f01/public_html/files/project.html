<h2>Final Project </h2>

Half your grade in this course will come from your final project which
will be the culmination of your work in the course. In it you will apply
the ideas explored in this course to a topic of interest to you.  Possible
topics are the collecting and analyzing data that interests you,
performing and analyzing a survey or clincal trial, constructing and
analyzing a game or strategy you have invented, or any other approved
relavent topic.   You are  encouraged to work a groups, though no group
may 
contain more than   three people.  If your projects includes a survey,
a taste
challenge or similar phenona you will be required to try them out and
discuss them with the
class and the class will be required to give you feed back (time
allowing).  During final's week the  Chance Fair will take place, at which
time you will give a poster/multimedia  presentation of
your project .  The project grade will be
decomposed into three individually graded
peices including: 
a draft (10% of your totasl grade), the final written project (including
all relavent data, 30%), and your poster board/mult media presentation
and explanation  
at the Chance Fair (10%).
