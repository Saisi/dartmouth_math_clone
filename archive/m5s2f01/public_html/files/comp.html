<h2> Maple Tools  </h2>

WARNING: When you copy stuff into maple avoid copying in anything that is

<p>
Many of your projects will involve involve small numbers.  When using
small numbers the use of the normal curve to find confidence intervals and
determine whether to reject or accept an hypothesis is not necessarily a
good idea.   Hence I am providing you with some computational tools to
help you accurately report and deal with small numbers.
<p>
Perhaps the most important is to be able to accurately compute the
<a
href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m5s2f01/files/Confidence.html">
confidence </a> you have
about a percentage you wish to quote.  This 
program will allow to explore the reportable  confidence  for your given
number samples as you vary the choice of confidence interval.  It will
also provide you with a picture which may help you and any reader of your
work to understand where this computation came from and why they should
put faith in it.  It is based on using our good friend the binomial
distributions.  
<p>
The next most important tool will likely be your ability to test an
 <a
href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m5s2f01/files/improved.html">
hypothesis</a> (new and improved!).  Many
common tests (like the chi-squared test) will not work
well if when testing a single hypothesis and are rather inaccurate when
using  small amount of data.  Here we give a way to explore the chance
that a given measurement is due to chance alone, given the acceptance a
null hypothesis.  It also provides a picture so that you may easily remind
your readers why they should put faith in your methodology. 
Once again this test  is based on using our good friend the binomial
distributions.

<p>
Here is a program allowing you to <a
href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m5s2f01/files/Competion.html">
compete </a> hypothesis
against each other. 

<p>
Excel does not produce nice <a
href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m5s2f01/files/Histogram.html"> histograms
</a> with out some effort.  This maple program does a pretty good job ,and
will help you confirm some of the  numbers which arise when looking at a
single set of data.

<p>
Excel does a better job at producing <a
href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m5s2f01/files/Scatter.html"> scatter
plots
</a>.  This maple program however will fuzz out the data and will be
particularly useful if you data contains lots of repeated information.
Once again it may also will help you confirm some of you numerical
suspicions.


<p>

Here is a program to help you understand <a
href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m5s2f01/files/Streak.html">
steaks </a> and run
large
numbers of streak experiments to compare empirical data.

<p>

Here is program allowing you to <a
href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m5s2f01/files/Simulate.html">
simulate </a> your own
probability distribution.  This
will help you compare what you believe is going on with some actual data
produced given this belief.

<p>
Here is a program allowing you to use  the slightly more
involved <a
href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m5s2f01/files/chit.html"> chi-square
test </a> (corrected 11/28/01).   This program does involve an
approximation and for small
amounts of data may not be accurate.  If you use this test and any of the
"classes" involved  have less than five members or there are only two
classes you must warn your reader that this test is known to
be  inaccurate when applied in such a setting.  Otherwise it is a test
you are free to simply use it.


<p>

Here  is a program that probably will not help you deal with <a
href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m5s2f01/files/NonLinear.html">
non-linear  </a>
correlations, but if you see me together we can probably get it to do so!
