<h2>Participation  </h2>


Participation in this course is crucial.  During most class meetings
we will break into
randomly selected groups and  discuss a list of
questions and ideas.  During this time the instructors will mill around
and allow as many groups as possible the  chance to discuss their
thoughts with us.   Later
you will write a journal elaborating upon this discussion.   A large part
of your participation grade will come from our view of how much you
contribute to these group discussion.  Furthermore toward the end of the
course you will be asked to give your thoughts concerning surveys and
proposals that other class member construct.  Your participation in this
dialog will be crucial to a good participation grade.
