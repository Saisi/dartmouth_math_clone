<h2> The Journal </h2>


<p> 

During each class we will break into groups and explore together several
ideas and questions.  Later you will reflect on these issues and write a
journal entry describing your conclusions.   It is important is that you
write clearly and show evidence of your own
intelligent commentary on the topics being examined.  You are
encourage to find references and examples to support any conclusion you
make, all of which should be carefully referenced.  
Each journal entry is to be typed on looseleaf paper.  During the first
seven weeks of the course you will be turning in your journals twice a
week
on (Mondays and Fridays). After this point the emphasis will shift to
your projects. 

<p> 

The journal will be graded out of 3 as follows:

<p>

<table align=center border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2 width=70%>
<tr>
<td align=left>0</td>
<td align=left> No journal was handed in, or what was handed in was in no
way acceptable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=left>1</td>
<td align=left>The journal entry lacked any demonstration of original or
independent thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=left>2</td>
<td align=left>The journal entry was acceptable, demonstrating an adequate
amount of original thinking on relevant topics.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=left>3</td>
<td align=left>The journal entry was exceptionally thoughtful or
insightful, exhibiting extensive independent thinking on relevant
topics (including, when relevant, the exploration of relevant ideas  
through the use of original examples).
</td>
