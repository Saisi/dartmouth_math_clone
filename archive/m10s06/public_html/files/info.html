<b>Grade</b>: Your 
grade will be determined via   
a Big Assignment  (10% of your grade),
Exam 1  (20% of your grade each),
Exam 2 (30% of your grade),  and the 
Final Exam  (40% of your grade).
Three quarters of each  exam's contribution to your grade  will consist of
modified homework problems.  The homework assignments and exam  dates  
can be found in the  class <a href="syl.html"> log.</a> 

<p>

<b>Honor  Principle</b>: 
On the exams, no help is to be given or received. 


<p>

<b>Students with disabilities</b>:  I encourage students with
disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases and 
learning disabilities, to discuss  with me  any
appropriate accommodations that 
might be helpful.

<p>

<b>X-Session</b>: The X-session will be used twice for review sessions 
(April 13th and May 11th).  The X-session may also be used to if we 
get behind in the syllabus, we are  forced to cancel lectures, or for 
help sessions where I can help orient you to  various  computational tools (like  <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>). 

<p>

<b>Rough Syllabus</b>
<!--< (<a href="syl.html"> Detailed Syllabus 
</a>)-->
:
An introduction to the basic concepts of statistics. Topics include elementary probability theory, descriptive statistics, the binomial and normal 
distributions, confidence intervals, basic concepts of tests of hypotheses, chi-square tests, non-parametric tests, normal theory t-tests, correlation, simple 
regression, analysis of variance, and  (if time permits) multiple regression and multi-factor analysis of variance. We hope to cover 
every topic in our book, and hence our book's  <a href="http://www.aw-bc.com:8081/catalog/academic/product/0,1144,0321200543-TOC,00.html"  
>table of  contents</a> can be used as a detailed course syllabus.  Also, the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/"> 
R-environment 
</a> for statistical computing and graphics will be used. We will be learning how to use R, and, in particular, we will see how to perform  and interpret most 
of the tasks 
in the  following <a
