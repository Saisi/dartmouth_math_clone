<br>
Differential equations relate a function to some expression involving
its derivatives or partial derivatives. &nbsp;Any quantity that obeys
rules involving its various rates of change can be modeled with these
equations. &nbsp;These kinds of equations therefore occur throughout
the sciences, engineering, economics and medicine.<br>
<br>
There are two sections of Math 23 this winter and they will proceed
together. &nbsp;The instructors are Professor Owen Dearricott and
Professor Dorothy Wallace. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b> Required book</b>: <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471433381.html"><i>Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems</i> (8th edition)</a> by Boyce and DiPrima (Wiley, 2004),
available at <a href="http://www.wheelockbooks.com/">Wheelock Books</a>.
Expensive but worth it!
There's a <a href="http://jws-edcv.wiley.com/college/bcs/redesign/student/0,,_0471433381_BKS_2021____,00.html">
Student companion site</a> with reviews, quizzes, Matlab, etc,
by chapter.&nbsp; We will also make use of The <a href="../../../~matc/eBookshelf/calculus/BigGreen.html">Big Green Ordinary Differential Equation Machine</a>&nbsp; to assist with numerical solutions.<br>
<br>
<p><b> Honor principle</b>. Exams: no help given or received. Homework:
<i>no copying</i>, however collaboration on approaches to problems is
encouraged. Write-ups must be done individually.

</p>
<p><b>Special needs</b>: Let me know if you have any, by the first 2 weeks.
Also stop by the Academic Skills Center in 301 Collis to register for support
services.

</p>
<p><b>Private tutoring</b>: Tutor Clearinghouse may have private
one-on-one tutors available for Math 23. The tutors are recruited on
the basis that they have done well in the subject, and are trained by
the Academic Skills Center. If a student receives financial aid, the
College will pay for three hours of tutoring per week. If you would
like to have a tutor, please go to 301 Collis and fill out an
application asap.

</p>
<p><b>Religious observance</b>: Some students may wish to take part
in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you
have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in
the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of
the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.
