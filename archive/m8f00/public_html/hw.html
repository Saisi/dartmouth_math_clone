<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Final Exam Information</B></FONT>
<BR><P>

You will be tested on the final exam on material from the 
entire term, from Day 1 to Day 28, and the coverage will be reasonably 
thorough.  However there will be an emphasis on the material since
the last exam.  In addition, most individual problems will not be overly computational
and there may be a few problems of a theoretical nature.   
<BR><P>
This exam will be somewhat longer than each of the two previous exams.  You will
have two hours for the exam.  This should give ample time to 
complete the exam, but please work as quickly and efficiently
as you can and check your work.  

<BR><P> The remarks (on this web page) for the previous exams concerning
arriving early, choosing alternate seats, bringing writing implements, etc.
hold for the final exam.  In particular, the earlier policy regarding calculators is 
still in effect: Calculators may be used for numerical work, but
under no circumstances are they to be used in any other way, e.g., to store
information, run programs, symbolic manipulation. They are certainly
not required, nor should they be of much use. Except in trivial cases
or when requested,
answers need not be simplified and more importantly, answers need to be
exact. 

<BR><P>
The final exams will not be returned to you.  However if you wish to 
see your exam and/or discuss your grade, you can make an appointment
with your instructor at the beginning of the winter term.

The second Math 8 exam will be held <B>Monday, Nov 6 from 4 - 6 pm</B>.
Webb's section will be in Room 101 Bradley Hall;
Arkowitz's section will be in Filene Auditorium.  <B> 
Please note that Filene Auditorium is in Moore Hall.  </B>

The exams for both sections are identical, but the seating and
the number of exams in each place is
limited.  <B>Please go to the room according to the section in which
you are registered.</B> 

<BR><P> <FONT COLOR="red"><B>Note: </B></FONT>Those people (<B>and only
those people</B>) with labs or other classes whose normal class times
overlap with our scheduled exam period, may take the Math 8 exam either
earlier or later the same day.  
<B>Please notify your instructor if you are in this situation.</B>
You will then be told when and where to take the exam.
<P>
If you will be away for a College-sponsored activity, you
should speak to your instructor to see if you can arrange to take the
exam <B>prior</B> to your departure.  <B>There are no makeup exams.</B>


<BR><P>
The exam covers all material from Day 11 through Day 20, that is,
all the assigned material starting with 13.1 and ending with 15.3, inclusive.
<BR><P>

The exam is designed so that well-prepared students can complete the exam
in one hour, however you will be given two hours for the exam which should
eliminate time pressure for all students.
<BR><P>

Please arrive by 3:45 pm to allow ample time to get seated, settled,
and exams distributed by 4:00. Please take seats leaving one or more empty seats between you and your
neighbor(s).  
<BR><P>
Naturally, bring writing implements; pens or pencils are fine.
Scrap paper will be attached to each exam; you may not use your own.
<BR><P>
Calculators may be used for numerical work if you like, but
under no circumstances are they to be used in any other way, e.g., to store
information, run programs, symbolic manipulation. They are certainly
not required, nor should they be of much use. Except in trivial cases
or when requested,
answers need not be simplified and more importantly, answers need to be
exact. For example, someone saying the answer to a problem is 1.414213562
instead of the correct answer of sqrt(2) is wrong, and may lose credit
accordingly.
<BR><P>
There will be a Question and Answer session on Sunday, Nov
5, starting at 7pm in Filene Auditorium (Moore Hall).

<BR><P> Sample questions will be distributed in class at
the end of the week.</TD>
