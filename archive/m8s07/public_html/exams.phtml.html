<H2>Final Exam: Saturday, June 2, 8-11 am, 007 Kemeny </H2>

The final is comprehensive, but you can expect roughly half of it to be on material covered since the last exam (Sections 14.1-14.4, 15.1-15.7), and 
half to be on the material from the first two exams.  The style of the final will be similar to that of the two midterms.  
<p>
**No calculators are allowed on the exams.  You are also not allowed any
notecard or formula sheet.**
<p>
The following material will NOT be covered:
<ul>
<li> Partial fractions with irreducible quadratic factors in the
denominator (8.4)</li>
<li>Estimates of sums using the integral test (12.3)</li>
<li> Taylor's Inequality (12.10)</li>
<li> Proving that a function is equal to its Taylor series (12.10)</li>
<li>Direction angles and direction cosines (13.3)</li>
<li>Curvature, normal and binormal vectors (14.3)</li>
<li>Tangential and normal components of acceleration, Kepler's laws (14.4)</li>
</ul>
