<P>We encourage you to contact us by e-mail for purposes of asking
questions, making comments, or setting up meetings.</P> 

<B><U><P>Teaching Asistant</U>:</B> <A HREF="mailto:Jason.A.Lewallen@dartmouth.edu">Jason Lewallen</A>, graduate student in Comparative Literature. Jason is researching the literary treatment of religious experiences in French and English 20th century fiction; he is planning to become a French professor.</P>

<B><U><P>Writing Specialist</U>:</B> <A HREF="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ejwhittington/">Jane Whittington</A>, 310 Kemeny, 646-9020, Office Hours: MTWF: 8:30-4:30.</P>

<B><U><P>Math Tutor</U>:</B> <A HREF="mailto:Ignacio.A.Rueda@dartmouth.edu">Ignacio Rueda</A> will hold regular tutorials Monday 8-9pm and Thursday 4-5pm, as well as "math review sessions" before exams. He will contact you about locations. The tutorials are strictly for your convenience, to help you learn the math. Drop by sometime, especially if you have a question.</P>

<B><U><P>General organization</U>:</B> </P> <P>The class will meet three days a week. Two of these meetings will follow a seminar/lecture format, for the most part alternating between humanities and mathematics. The Friday session will usually revolve around student presentations and joint presentations by the instructors to bridge gaps across disciplines. The list of student presentation topics for Friday discussions will be announced and circulated for sign-up during the second week of the term.  All students should review the topics for the Friday Discussion before coming to class.</P> 

<B><U><P>Course Website</U>:</B> </P> <P>The address of the <I>CL 65/Math 5,
Winter 2007 - A Matter of Time</I> website is <A
HREF="index.html">http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m5w07/</A>.
We will use it as an integral part of the course, so you definitely should check
it out right away and add it to your bookmarks.</P> 

<B><U><P>Assignments and
grades</U>:</P> </B><P>In addition to completing all reading assignments and math assignments by the due-date, students will be expected to give presentations on Fridays and to participate actively in class discussions. They will be asked to write a paragraph on topics listed on the syllabus for weeks 2 and 5. There also will be two exams (one each in weeks four and seven), and a final paper. The exams will include short essay questions as well as math problems. The questions will draw on material from the textbook and the reader. The final will be a seven-to-ten-page double-spaced <A HREF="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~krescook/instruct/math5/resources.htm">library research</A> paper on a choice of assigned topics, due on the first day of final examinations. Students will be required to submit a first draft to <A HREF="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ejwhittington/">Jane Whittington</A>, the Math department's writing specialist, for comments. (See the syllabus for anticipated schedule.) The two exams and the paper will each be worth 100 points, the Friday presentations 50 points, the two paragraphs 30 points, and class participation 50 points for an overall total of 430 points.</P> 

<B><U><P>Meetings with your instructors</U>:</P> </B><P>You should not hesitate to contact either one of your instructors about issues related to the course. You can send e-mail messages to us, make appointments, or drop into our scheduled office hours.</P> 

<B><U><P>Academic Honor Principle</U>:</P></B> 
<P><B>On in-class exams:</B> As you prepare for an exam, feel free to brainstorm with fellow students, and the tutor, or your instructors. During the taking of the exam itself, no help is to be given or received.</P>
<P><B>On homework, the final paper:</B> Feel free to brainstorm with fellow students, the tutor, or your instructors. However, when it comes to writing your paper (or any other materials for submission), you must do so by yourself without outside assistance and in your own words. In this regard, it is a violation of the Honor Principle to share electronic files or notes, or to participate in editing a joint document. You must produce by yourself the paper written for submission.</P>
<P><B> On the Friday student presentations:</B> These will be done by groups of 3 students. They will work collaboratively, each doing his or her part, and then combining materials into a coherent whole. The latter will most probably entail the sharing of electronic files. Each student will get an individual grade.<DIR>

<B><P>&#9;</P></DIR>

<U><P>Students with Disabilities</U>:</P> </B><P>We encourage students with documented disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities such as chronic diseases, learning disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities, to discuss possible accommodations with one of your instructors. Students might want to consult as well Student Accessibility Services, 301 Collis Center, ext. 6-2014. In addition to providing information and services, the office can assist with determining appropriate accomodations.
