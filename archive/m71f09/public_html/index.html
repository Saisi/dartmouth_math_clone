Students should state what sources they have consulted, with whom they have collaborated and from whom they have received help. Students are not to use solutions to problems that are posted on the web. The solutions that a student submits must be written by him or her alone. Any copying of another person's solutions, in whole or in part, is a violation of the Honor Code.</i> <br></li></ul><p><table bgcolor="#7397b0" border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2" width="100%">  <tbody>    <tr>      <th align="left"><a name="disabilities"></a> Disabilities</th>    </tr>  </tbody></table></p><ul>  <li> Students with learning, physical, or psychiatric disabilities enrolled in this course who may need disability-related&nbsp;  accommodations are encouraged to meet with the instructor before the end of the second week of the term.
