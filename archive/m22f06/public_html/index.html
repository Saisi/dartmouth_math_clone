<!-- Course Description information -->
In this course, we use Euclidean space to develop intuition about
ideas such as linear transformations, determinants, vector spaces,
coordinates, the dimension of a vector space, and inner products. We
also discuss the idea of a proof, including what should and should not
be included and how to write them coherently. These discussions will
occur mainly during the x-hours (x-hour proof workshops) and will
roughly consist of
<ul>
<li>the class broken up into small groups to write proofs and
<li>individual students writing proofs on the board so that we can
discuss in general what we want, as well as what we want to avoid,
when we write proofs.
</ul>
In addition, 5 points on each exam will be "style" points. I expect
everyone to earn all 5 points, but if I have to read a solution more
than once because I cannot follow your work, you may lose style
points. On the final, you will only be able to lose style points; in
other words, I will not set aside a certain number of points for
style but will take off points on questions that I have difficulty
following <font size=2>(This is based on the <i>Teaching Time
Savers</i> column published by the
<a href="http://www.maa.org">MAA</a> in the August/September 2006

</table>
<br>

<!-- Homework policy information -->
For each day of class (not including x-hour proof workshops, x-hours
during which you take part of an exam, and the day before an exam), I
will post an associated assignment on the
<a href="m22assignments.html">HW Assignments</a> page. I will collect
these assignments at the <b>BEGINNING</b> of class on <b>MONDAYS</b>.
I strongly encourage you <b>NOT</b> to put off the assignemnt until
the night before it is due. You may work together on these
assignments, but you must write up your answers individually. Clearly
indicate the exercise that you are solving by giving the section of
the exercise and the exercise number. If you use more than one piece
of paper, staple the pages together. Do <b>NOT</b> do your homework
with anything except a pencil or a pen with either blue or black ink
(<b>NO MARKERS, COLORED PENCILS, or CRAYONS</b>).
<br><br>
All homework assignments are due at the <b>START</b> of class on the
day they are due. <b>LATE HOMEWORK WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED FOR ANY
REASON</b>. The grader is permitted to deduct 1 point on any homework
without a name, on any homework that is not neat and stapled, or on
any homework done in anything except a pencil or a pen with either
blue or black ink.
<br><br>
Each exercise will be graded 0, 1/2, or 1, as follows:
<ul>
<li>0 &ndash; exercise either not attempted or attempted with no
progress made toward a solution/proof
<li>1/2 &ndash; exericse attempted, with some progress made toward a
solution/proof, but the solution/proof contains a significant error
(you have shown that you understand where to start)
<li>1 &ndash; solution/proof of exercise is essentially correct;
errors are minor (you have clearly shown that you understand what you
need to do and how to do it)
</ul>
The total number of points you earn on homework will be converted to a
number out of 100 in computing final grades. Thus, if there are 200
exercises assigned over the entire term and you earn 140 points, then
you will earn 70 points out of 100.

</table>
<br>

<!-- Memos information -->
At the end of each week, you are to submit a memo by email; this is
due by <b>23:59 (11:59 pm) every Sunday</b>. The purpose of these
memos is to help both of us keep track of your progress in the course.
Do <b>NOT</b> submit your memo as an attachment to an email; write it
in the body of the email itself. Among the things your memos could
address are the following:
<ul>
<li> your feelings about the pace of the class (too slow, too fast,
just right),
<li> how comfortable (or uncomfortable) you feel about the material
covered during the past week,
<li> how an exam went (too hard/too easy, how you think you did,
whether your performance accurately reflects your knowledge of the
material, etc.),
<li> other concerns that you have.
</ul>
In your first memo (due by 23:59 on September 24), introduce yourself.
Tell me why you are taking this class, what your major is (or if you
don't have one, some possibilities for a major), what some of your
hobbies are, what your background is, and anything else you think I
should know.
<br><br>
The last memo of the term is due by 23:59 (11:59 pm) on Sunday,
December 3.

<br>

<!-- Examinations Information -->
We will have two exams and a final in this course. The exams will have
two parts: you will do one part during the x-hour; you will pick up
the second part during the x-hour, and it is to be handed in at the
<b>START</b> of the next class period. You will be allowed to use your
notes and the text for the take-home part of each exam but <b>NOT</b>
for the in-class part. For the take-home part, clearly indicate the
problem you are doing, staple your pages together if you use more than
one, and do <b>NOT</b> do the problems using anything except a pencil
or a pen with either black or blue ink (<b>no markers, colored
pencils, or crayons</b>). The final will <b>NOT</b> have a take-home
part. You are to neither receive nor give help on any exam or final.
The two exams and final are tentatively scheduled as follows:

<!-- Honor Principle details -->
You are encouraged and permitted to collaborate on homework, but it is
a violation of the honor code for someone to provide the answers for
you. In other words, feel free to talk to other students while
thinking about an exercise, but write up your solutions independently.
You are also on your honor not to talk to another student about an
exam or final until both you and the other student have handed in the
exam or final.

Tutorial assistance for this course, that is, help with your homework,
will be available in 102 Bradley, Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays
evenings 7 - 10pm.  Tutorials will begin on Thursday, September 26.
<P>

Also note that the Tutor Clearinghouse will have private one-on-one
tutors available for Math 8.  The tutors are recruited on the basis
that they have done well in the subject, and are trained by the
Academic Skills Center.  If a student receives financial aid, the
College will pay for three hours of tutoring per week.  If you would
like to have a tutor, please go to 301 Collis and fill out an
application as early in the term as possible.
