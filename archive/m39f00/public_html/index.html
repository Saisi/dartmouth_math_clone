X-hour: Thursday 1-1:50<BR>

Instructor: Jim Baumgartner<BR>

There is no text.  Much of the course will be based on H. Enderton,  "A mathematical introduction to logic".<BR>
  This book is hard to obtain, and will be superseded by a new edition in December, so it is not required.</CENTER></H3>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">It is not easy to give a syllabus, since the content of the course will depend on the students and their interests.  We will spend time developing the theory of sentential logic first, then first-order logic, and then the development of some spplications including for example a more modern way of developing the calculus together with some other subjects.  There will not be time to cover G&ouml;del's Incompleteness Theorem, although we will cover G&ouml;del's Completeness Theorem.<HR>
Homework will be assigned periodically and will be due roughly once a week.  There will be a take-home midterm examination and a take-home final examination<HR>
