<p> For this, our final week of the course:<br>
x-period for review on Tuesday;<br>
last day of classes Wednesday;<br>
tutorial Thursday evening as usual;<br>
Prof. Pomerance will not have office hours after Wednesday;<br>
TA Pollack will have office hours on Wednesday and Friday as usual;<br>
Final Exam will be on Friday at 3 pm in Bradley 102 (not our usual room).
</p>

<p>
Studying:  For earlier material in the course there is ample
material, with old study problems, old tests, and assignments.<br>
Here are a few thoughts regarding Chapter 6 material:<br>
We will discuss Section 6.4 on Wednesday; it would help to read this
beforehand.<br>
Describe how to implement the "powermod" algorithm to compute a^b (mod n)
in the context of elliptic curve groups; that is to compute bP in an
elliptic curve group, given an element P and a positive integer b.<br>
Describe in detail an algorithm that computes -P, given an elliptic curve
and a point P on it.<br>
Give the formulas for the homogeneous coordinates of P+Q, given points
P, Q in homogeneous form on an elliptic curve.  Give your answer with
no fractions visible.
</p>

			<p style="text-align : justify">
The theme of the course is number theory and its application to public-key 
cryptography.  In a somewhat fast manner we will develop the necessary
tools in number theory, including prime numbers, modular arithmetic,
and elliptic curves.  We will apply these tools to public-key
cryptography, which is the backbone of security on the Internet.
It is assumed that students have taken some algebra and so are
familiar with basic algebraic structures.  It will also be assumed
that students are comfortable with proofs.

Homework due May 26:
Book problems 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.7<br>
</p>
<p> Homework due on Friday, May 12.<br>
Book problems 4.6 through 4.9.<br>
Also: Show that for any nonzero integer a,
there are infinitely primes p with (a/p)=1.<br>
<p> Homework due Friday, May 5:<br>
Problems 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 in the book.<br>
(4) Suppose d^2 |p-1, where p is prime.  Suppose g is a primitive root
modulo p, <br>
we have the nonzero residue t (mod p), and t &equiv g^a (mod p).<br>
We do not know a, but we wish to compute the residue a (mod d^2).<br>
Show how this can be done as two separate problems of size d, so taking O(d)<br>
steps if one searches naively, or O(d^{1/2}) steps if one uses
baby steps/giant steps.<br>
</p>
<p>Homework due Monday, May 1:<br>
(1) Do the 3 problems in Chapter 3.<br>
(2) Show that if p is a prime and d|p-1, then a nonzero residue
u (mod p) is a d-th power mod p (that is, a residue of the form u &equiv x^d ( mod p)),
if and only if u^{(p-1)/d} &equiv 1 (mod p).<br>
(3) Show that if p is a prime and d|p-1, g is a primitive root mod p,
and u is a nonzero residue mod p, then exactly one of u, ug, ..., ug^{d-1}
is a d-th power mod p.<br>
(4) Explain how you can use the previous two exercises to do the following:
You are trying to solve the discrete log problem g^a &equiv t (mod p).
You are given the prime p, a nonzero residue t, and a primitive root g,
so it is a you are looking for.  You know that d|p-1.  Give an algorithm
to compute a (mod d) that should be fairly efficient if d is small.
Explain why doing discrete logs for the prime p = 2311 is fairly easy.

<p>
Homework due Friday, April 14 (the assignment is complete): <br>
Chapter 2, numbers 3, 6, 7, 17, 21, 9-12, 20, 23.
</p>
<p>
Homework due Friday, April 7 (assignment is complete):<br>
(1) Say that a positive even number is "prime-even" if it cannot be written
as the product of two smaller positive even numbers.  Show that unique
factorization into prime-evens fails for the positive even numbers.<br>

(2) The book has the example of the ring Z[&alpha;], where &alpha; is
a squareroot of -5.  It claims that unique factorization is violated
because 6 = (2)(3) = (1+&alpha;)(1-&alpha;).  Assuming the only units
in Z[&alpha;] are 1 and -1, prove the assertion that the two different
looking factorizations of 6, involve different "irreducibles."
(An irreducible is a nonzero element that cannot be factored into
two factors unless at least one of the factors is a unit.)<br>

(3) In the proof of the Division Theorem (Prop. 1.1.10) we are to
look at the set of nonnegative numbers of the form a-nb.  Show that
if b is not 0, then n = -|a|b gives a nonnegative member of the set
regardless of the signs of a and b.<br>

(4) In this problem give proofs that do not rely on the Fundamental
Theorem of Arithmetic.  The letters a,b,c,d are integers.<br>
(i) If gcd(a,b)=1 and d|a, prove that gcd(d,b)=1.<br>
(ii) If ab|n prove that b|n.<br>
(iii) If a|bc and gcd(a,b)=1, prove that a|c.<br>
(iv) If a|n, b|n, and gcd(a,b)=1, prove that ab|n.<br>

(5) Do the chapter 1 problems on page 20.  Does the limit in
problem 4 imply the following?  If one chooses a random integer
in [1,x], the probability that it is prime tends to 0 as x goes
to infinity.

			to problems that may be posted on the web,
