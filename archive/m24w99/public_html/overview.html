<P>
This course will provide an introduction to linear algebra and
proofs. We will explore the notion of vector spaces and linear maps
between them.  Problems will be both computational and theoretical.
The x-hour will be used to hone proof skills.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Homework assigned on consecutive Wednesdays, Fridays, Mondays is
due <B>in class</B> on following Thursday.  Thus homework assigned
Monday, January 4 is due in class on Thursday, January 7; and homework
assigned January 6, 8, and 11 is due Thursday, January 14. </TD>
<P>
<LI>Homework is to be written <B>neatly</B> using one side of 8 1/2 x
11 inch paper.  Do <B>not</B> use paper from a spiral notebook unless
you can tear off the ragged edge.  All papers are to be stapled.
<P>
<LI>Late homework will not be accepted in the absense of divine
intervention or matters of similar weight.</TD>
<P>
<LI>While homework is collected weekly, it is assigned daily so that
you can work on it daily since many of the problems you consider will
require reflection.  Moreover, lectures assume that you have at least
begun to assimilate the ideas presented in the problems.  In other
words, waiting until the last moment to do your homework will be
detrimental to your understanding and measured progress; but of
course, the decision is yours :-).

</TR>
</TABLE>
<UL>
<LI>For homework and for Thursday discussions, I encourage you to talk
to and exchange ideas with other students.  Reach a consensus about a probable
proof or counterexample to a problem.  <B>Then</B>  write your solutions up
by yourself.  Aside from being intellectually honest, this will quickly point
out to you ideas you don't fully understand, and indicate things for you to
review.
<P>
<LI>For exams, all work must be your own.  Take home portions of the
exam will be open book and notes.
