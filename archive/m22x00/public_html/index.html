<B><P>Homework: </B>Our homework grader is Matthew DeLellis.. He will be asked to grade each set on a basis of two points each. Essentially correct work rates 2, incorrect work rates 0, and something in between rates 1. Homework does not count for the final grade unless you end between two grades. Then homework will move you to one or the other. Do the homework even though it may not count for the final grade! There is ample evidence to show that those who do badly on the homework also do badly on the final grade. </P>
