<B>This Week’s Homework:</B>
Be sure to look over (but not turn) in 2.4 : 1,2,15,18 and 2.5:1,11,12.

<P>
Turn in 2.4: 3,4,5,8,12,17 and 2.5: 2(a,b,c),4,5,9  and the first and
third exercises from the geometry hand out (Please rewrite any arguments
found in
our   book in your own words. Also both these arguments work fine in
infinite dimensions,  unlike last week's exercise). 

<P>
<B>Note:</B>  The first problem was written dwon rather
badly (I choos at the last moent to go from a vector space to itself
rather than between vector spaces).

<P>
1. Let <I>L</I> be an isometry form (<I>V</I>,&lt;-,-&gt;) to itself, then <I>L</I>
preserves all inner-products, i.e.   <BR><P></P>

<B>Proposed
Topics For this Week:</B>
Inverses, isomorphisms, and change of basis.  Also winter carnival is
Friday and we will have no class then.

<P>
<B>The X-session Topic</B> 
Proof madness! We will go through a variety of arguments and styles using
actual examples from homework.  <B>Requests are welcome!</B>. Just blitz me
any problems that gave you trouble and we'll talk about them.
