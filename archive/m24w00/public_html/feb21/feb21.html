<B>There is a take home exam being handed out Monday and due Friday at
the begining of class</B>(due to a polite request).  However the exam should
not take that long and the homework for the following Monday is still due
on Monday (though I think you will find the homework particularly straight
forward.)

<P>
By the way I thought for the final that I'd hand it out Fri. Mar 3 and let
you do it in any time before Mon Mar 13 at noon.  (The exam will be about
the same length as our other exams,   I'm doing this to ensure that  every 
one can find some window of time in which to do it.)  If this a problem
for some reason please inform me as  soon as possible.    

<P>
<B>This Week’s Homework:</B>
Please turn in Section 3.4: 5,6,8,9 and 4.4: 1,2((a),(d),(g)),
3((a),(f)),6

<DD>"Magical" in part 2(h).  To understand the meaning of the magic it may be
necessary to try i and j.  The matrix in this basis  will be  
"magical" if you will find the
computation in part 2(j)  strangely  easy. Your job is to articulate
what quality of this matrix made the computation easy.   (The warning
is:  even if you get
the correct answer  you may fail to be able to articulate what makes it so
darn magical until you try the next two parts.)

<P>
<DT>5.
<DD>In the extra credit notice that all <I>i</I>'s  used to index  these sums  
should be <I>n</I>'s.

<P>
<DT>6.
<DD>In part 2(j) you are computing (<I>T</I><SUB>2</SUB>)<SUP><I>N</I></SUP>,  which is in the <B>original</B>
matrix raised to tne <I>N</I><SUP><I>th</I></SUP> power (i.e. in the original basis).  You
will
have to ask yourself how to
exploit the magic in <I>h</I> and the fact proved in <I>i</I> do do this.

is the vector space of real valued
(thought this doesn't matter) functions on the real line with the
property
that all their  derivatives exist and are continous.  
(For the purposes of
this problem it is fine to  simply view it as a vector space of functions  
that contains the polynomials and   <I>N</I>(<I>D</I>).  
Certainly no detailed
understanding of this space or indeed differential equations is needed
to do this problem.)

<B>Proposed Topics For this Week:</B>
On Monday we will finish our initial discussion of transition
matrixes and probability vectors.  In particular we need to understand how
to relate transition matrixes with graphs and
understand all the interpretations involved. For the record:

<P>
<B>definitions:</B>
A transition matrix is a square matrix with all positive entries and all
columns summing up to one. Each application of the transition matrix will
be reffered to as a the passing of a time "click".
 A probability vector is
a column
vector with all positive entries with its entries summing up to one.  A
probabilty vector will often represents for us a population's distribution
amoung the set of "nodes" used to define the the transition matrix, and
will sometimes be reffered to as the population distribution.
A "quantity"  will be a row vector.

<P>
On Wednesday   we will discuss determinants.  Despite my
personal
affection for determinants we will only  be carefully covering 
section 4.4 out of
chapter 4; which is a summary of properties of determinants. In the
process we 
will only experience a sort of 
"greatest hits" of the arguments involved.  
 
On Friday we will introduce an eigen-vector and eigen-value and give lots
of examples.

<P>
<B>The X-session Topic</B> 

<P>
Using maple.  We will look at how to use maple to solve some  basic
problems and discuss the possible alogithms one could use to do these
things.  Parcipitation  is optional. 

<P>
<B>Some Maple Code:</B>

<P>
Herre is some maple code from last Friday's and this Monday's lectures.
Note that row reduction (gaussjord) is being used to construct T1's
inverse,
labeled In.  The most confusing bit of code is the picking off of the
necessary columns of the reduced augmented matrix,  where you must
transpose the matrix with its rows given by the corresponding columns.

<P>
<P>
<TT>with(linalg):
  
</TT>
<P>
<TT>T1 := array( [[0,1/4,0,1/3,0],[1/3,1/4,1/10,0,1/6],
[1/3,1/4,1/2,2/3,1/6],[1/3,0,3/10,0,1/6],[0,1/4,1/10,0,1/2]] );
</TT>
<P>
<TT>v := array([[3/10],[2/10],[2/10],[1/10],[2/10]]);
</TT>
<P>
<TT>evalf(multiply(T1,v));
</TT>
<P>
<TT>evalf(multiply(T1,T1,v));
</TT>
<P>
<TT>evalf(multiply(T1,T1,T1,T1,T1,v));
</TT>
<P>
<TT>I5 := diag(1, 1,1,1,1);
</TT>
<P>
<TT>A1 := augment(T1,I5);
</TT>
<P>
<TT>G1 := gaussjord(A1, 'r');
</TT>
<P>
<TT>In := transpose(matrix([col(G1,6..10)]));
</TT>
<P>
<TT>multiply(In,v);
</TT>
