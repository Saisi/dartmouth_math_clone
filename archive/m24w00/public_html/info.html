<p>
<b>Syllabus</b>: Announcements as well as each week's material
will presented  in that week's <a href="dlog.html">Weekly Log</a>.
 
<p>

<b>Grade</b>: Your grade will be determined as follows:
<PRE>
Category         Weight         
----------------------------------     
homework         40%            
3 exams          20% each
</PRE>   
<p>
<b>Homework</b> Each  week about forty problems will be assigned and about
half of those will be assigned to be turned in.  
The homework that is turned in 
will be 
due by the following Monday's class time. You will be gradeded on style as
well as content, so please write these problems up
{\bf{carefully}\}.  Also be warned that only a select few of the turned in
problems will actually be graded, so please write them all up nicely. Each
day that an assignment is late will
result in a 10 percent penalty.  In order to make sure you are getting
what you need from this course you will want to do all the problems
and it is your responsibility to do the entire problem set.  
The assignments can be found
in each week’s  
<a href="dlog.html">Weekly Log</a>
<p>
<b>Exams</b>
 All the exams will be take home.  You will receive the first two exams
Monday January 31  and Monday Febuary 21.  The exams will be due by the
x-session
times on Thursday February 3  and Thursday February 24 respectively;  at
which time
the exams will be discussed.   The final will likely be handed out the
last day
of class (maybe earlier) and is to be turned at our scheduled final exam
time (as
scheduled by the registrar).
 <p>
<b>Makeup policy</b>: 
Makeup exams will only be given in case of
legitimate emergencies.  
<p>
<b>Honor policy</b>:
Collaboration is encouraged during the process of
thinking about homework problems, but is not acceptable while writing
up your final solutions. 
No collaboration of any form is acceptable during exams, and (expect when
explicitly stated on the exam) the use of any references other than your
class notes and our book  is not acceptable.
<p>


<b>Students with disabilities</b>:  I encourage students with
disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases
and learning disabilities, to discuss me any
appropriate accommodations that might be helpful. 


<p>

time to time.  If you are not familiar with Maple, <a
