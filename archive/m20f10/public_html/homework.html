<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: windowtext;"></span><br>



<p><span style="color: windowtext;"> Every week, there will be one problem set and one proof assignment. The problem sets will consist primarily of computational exercises (similar to those found in the textbook). They are designed to test your understanding of the material that we have already covered in class. The proof assignments will each consist of 1-2 problems that require a rigorous justification of your thought process. They are designed to foreshadow future course material and to stretch your imagination.</span></p>


<p> I will post the problem sets and proof assignments on this page at the end of class every Monday. The problem sets will be due on Fridays and the written assignments will be due on the following Mondays. Both will be collected at the beginning of class. Each problem set is worth 10 points, while each proof assignment is worth 5 points. Please keep this in mind when working on the homework.</p>


<p> The problem sets and proof assignments can be typed or handwritten, in pencil or pen, on any type of paper that you prefer as long as I am able to read it. I reserve the right to give no credit for papers that I deem illegible. </p>
