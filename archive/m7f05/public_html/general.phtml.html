During the course of the term you will write four papers; they are described below.<p>Your papers must total at least 25 double-spaced pages, not including pictures and diagrams.  Recommended lengths foreach paper are given below, but I expect you to make each paper the right length for whatever you have to say.  If itseems that your paper will be much shorter or longer than the recommended length, you may need to expand or narrowyour topic.  If at the end of the term your four papers do not total 25 pages, you may write a fifth paper to make upthe difference.<p>On most Fridays you will have a paper due in either first draft or final form.  On other days you may have a shortassignment given in the previous class, generally a paragraph or two.<p><ul><li>Paper 1:  An essay about a philosophical topic.  Recommended length 5-8 pages.<li>Paper 2:  An exposition of a mathematical problem.  Recommended length, 5-8 pages.<li>Paper 3:  A research paper.  Recommended length, 10-15 pages.<li>Paper 4:  A paper about mathematics and philosophy.  Recommended length, 5-8 pages.</ul><p>More details about the paper assignments are on the "Papers" web page; due dates are on the "Syllabus" web page.  (These pages have still to be added.)<p><br><!-- Homework policy separator --><table bgcolor=#7397b0 border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left><A NAME="hw"></a>Homework Policy</th></table><p><!-- Homework policy information -->"Homework" in this course falls into three classifications.  The most substantial homework assignments are the four papers described above.<p>You will also be assigned reading from the course reader.  You should come to class prepared to discuss the assignedreading, and especially to ask questions about anything you found unclear.  Due dates for readings are on the"Syllabus" web page (still to be added.)<p>Occasional short assignments, either a paragraph or two of writing or a math problem, may be given in class and aredue the next class.  <p><br><!-- Grades Separator --><table bgcolor=#7397b0 border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left><a name="grades"></a>Grades</th></table><p><!-- Information -->Your grade in this course sill depend on your class participation and your writing.<p>Class participation grades will be based on the following:  Are you present in class?  Are you prepared? When the class divides into small groups, do you work together with your group to help make sure everyoneunderstands everything?  Do you contribute to class discussions when you are asked to?  Do yourcontributions to class discussions help to make the discussions go well?  In other words, classparticpation grades are not based on whether you talk a lot or say brilliant things, but on whether youare a responsible participant in the class's intellectual inquiry.<p>The occcasional short daily assignments will be graded on a credit / no credit basis.  You may be asked to rewritesomething in order to receive credit.<p>Papers will be given letter grades.  The grade will be based on both content and exposition and willreflect the quality of the final version of your paper.  First drafts are required, but count toward yourfinal paper grade only in that you submit a complete first draft on time to receive full credit; comments onfirst drafts are a way of helping you produce a better paper in the end.  More details about the standardsby which individual papers will be judged will be given as part of each paper assignment.<p>Late papers will be accepted for partial credit.  There is no way to "make up" a class particpation grade or shortassignment, but see the professor if a genuine emergency prevents you from coming to class.<p>About 80% of your grade will be based on your four papers, and the rest on class participation and dailyassignments.<p><br><!-- Honor Principle separator --><table bgcolor=#7397b0 border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left><a name="honor"></a>The Honor Principle</th></table><p><!-- Honor Principle details -->Academic integrity and intellectual honesty are an integral part of academic practice.  This does not meanthat you can't work together or get ideas and help from other people.  It does mean that you can't presentsomebody else's work or ideas without giving them due credit.<p>In the case of short daily assignments such as mathematics problems, feel free to discuss questions withother people and to work together to answer them.  You must write up the answers yourself without copyingfrom anybody.  (This means you cannot copy down a joint solution arrived at by a group working together,even if you were part of the group.  You must write up the solution in your own words.)<p>Obviously, you must write your papers yourself.  It is fine to discuss your papers with other people andget help and advice, BUT:  Whenever you are using another person's work, words, research, or ideas, whether theycome from a book or from conversation with a friend, you must acknowledge the source.  The booklet<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~sources/"><i>Sources</i></a>sets out guildelines for acknowledging sources; you should read and follow them.  You are responsible for knowing and following these guidelines.<p>The <a href="Http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ejwhittington/">mathematics department writing specialist,</a>Ms. Jane Whittington, is available for consultation onpapers for this course or any other mathematical writing.  You are encouraged, and may at some point in theterm be required, to consult with her.  If you do so, please turn in the copy of your draft that wasedited by Ms. Whittington along with your final paper.<p><br><!-- Disabilities separator --><table bgcolor=#7397b0 border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left><A NAME="disabilities"></a>Disabilities</th></table><p><!-- Disabilities statement -->Students with disabilities who will be taking this course and may needdisability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make anappointment to see the instructor as soon as possible. Also, theyshould stop by the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/admin/acskills/">Academic Skills Center</a>in Collis Center to register for support services.<p>
