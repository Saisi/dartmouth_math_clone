<p><b>NOTE:</b>&nbsp; The JMP files are now in the Math 10 course folder
on Public, not compressed, as well as here on the web site in compressed
format.
<p>Here is a JMP file with the data from the <a href="http://emmy.dartmouth.edu/~m10s00/survey.JMP.sit.hqx">class
survey.</a>
<p>Here is a JMP file with the <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m10s00/old.book.measurements.JMP.sit.hqx">old
book measurements t</a>hat we made in class on Friday, March 31.
<p>Here is a JMP file with the <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m10s00/new.book.measurements.JMP.sit.hqx">new
book measurements</a> that we made in small groups on Monday and Tuesday,
April 3 and 4.&nbsp; The final three columns have the measurements, in
thirty-seconds of an inch, made by each small group separately, in case
you want to compare the distributions.
<p>Here is a copy of the <a href="http://emmy.dartmouth.edu/~m10s00/M10.syllabus.html">syllabus
and assignments </a>through this week.
<p>Here are the JMP files for the measurements we took in small groups
on&nbsp; <a href="http://emmy.dartmouth.edu/~m10s00/body.meas.MPM.JMP.sit.hqx">Monday
PM</a>, <a href="http://emmy.dartmouth.edu/~m10s00/body.meas.TAM.JMP.sit.hqx">Tuesday
AM</a>, and <a href="http://emmy.dartmouth.edu/~m10s00/body.meas.TPM.JMP.sit.hqx">Tuesday
PM</a>.
<p>Here are the files for the April 17/18 small groups.&nbsp; The file
<a href="http://emmy.dartmouth.edu/~m10s00/lab3.data.sit.hqx">lab.3.data</a>
contains the actual weights of all the puzzle pieces.&nbsp; The file <a href="http://emmy.dartmouth.edu/~m10s00/lab3.results.sit.hqx">lab.3.results</a>
contains the data you collected.&nbsp; On Monday afternoon the random number
generator was not working correctly, so Rebecca and I produced random samples
in place of the ones from that group.&nbsp; We have separated them out
in the file.
<p>Here is a JMP file for use with problem <a href="http://emmy.dartmouth.edu/~m10s00/4.8.JMP.sit.hqx">4.8</a>.&nbsp;
And here is a file, <a href="http://emmy.dartmouth.edu/~m10s00/z-computer.JMP.sit.hqx">z-computer</a>,
that you can use to compute z-scores and such.&nbsp; Put your data in Column
1.&nbsp; The next two columns give the z-scores (relative to the standard
deviation and mean for that data), and the proportion of individuals who
will have a lower z-score (the same proportion you would look up in the
table of standard normal probabilities.)&nbsp; If you want the z-score
and probability computed relative to a larger population for which you
know the mean and standard deviation, enter that mean and standard deviation
in the first entries of Columns 4 and 5; the final two columns give the
z-scores and standard normal probabilities for your data.&nbsp; The file
currently has the heights of women on the class survey in Column 1; the
mean and standard deviattion for the heights of all young American women
have been entered in Columns 4 and 5.
<p>Here are the results of the <a href="http://emmy.dartmouth.edu/~m10s00/lab4.results.JMP.sit.hqx">Coca-Cola&nbsp;</a>

<a href="http://emmy.dartmouth.edu/~m10s00/lab4.results.JMP.sit.hqx">tasting</a>.
<p>Here are some comments and the data from our <a href="http://emmy.dartmouth.edu/~m10s00/pea.writeup.html">pea-weighing
exercise</a>:
<p>Here are JMP files for use with problems <a href="http://emmy.dartmouth.edu/~m10s00/9.9.JMP.sit.hqx">9.9</a>
and <a href="http://emmy.dartmouth.edu/~m10s00/9.12.JMP.sit.hqx">9.12</a>.&nbsp;
To produce a two-way table, use "Analyze: Fit Y by X", with both X and
Y being categorical variables.&nbsp; The chi-squared test described in
the textbook is the one called "Pearson" by JMP.
<p>Here is the <a href="http://emmy.dartmouth.edu/~m10s00/peanuts.JMP.sit.hqx">peanut
data</a> from the last small group meeting.
