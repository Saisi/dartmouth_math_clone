<P> <FONT COLOR=339E7A SIZE="+2"><B>Homework</B></FONT><BR> Homework will be
due by 8:00 a.m. each Monday and Friday. The homework problem sets will be done
over the web using the WeBWorK system. This problem-generator allows you to get a
hard copy of an assignment, input the answers, submit the problems for grading,
and go over the correct answers. It even lets you review your record so that you
can see how well you are doing. Moreover, you will be able to practice solving
similar problems. 

<P> All Math 3 homework assignments will be posted on <A HREF="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/webwork/m3f01">WeBWorK</A> weekly, with for example problem set "day05" on WeBWorK corresponding to "class 5" on the Daily Schedule.

<P> <FONT COLOR=339E7A SIZE="+2"><B>Exam Study Questions</B></FONT><BR> Study
questions will be posted here before each of the exams this term. The questions
will be taken from past years' exams and current material.  The questions should
provide some indication of the nature and depth of typical exam questions, but
they should not be regarded as an exhaustive study guide.

<P>The actual hour exam, on Wednesday, October 24, 3:30-4:45 will have ten multiple choice problems worth a total of 60 points and three long-answer questions worth 40 points.

<P>Be sure to review all past homework carefully. You can even login to Webwork as a practice user (username and password are both practice1, or if busy practice2, etc.) to get a new version of a problem. This is the best way to get ready for the exam because the practice problems above do not necessarily cover all the concepts for which you are responsible.

<P>The actual hour exam, on Wednesday, November 14, 3:30-4:45 will have ten multiple choice problems worth a total of 60 points and three long-answer questions worth 40 points. The exam will concentrate on material from day12 through day20 (except for putting the curve sketching information together and drawing the curve).

<P>Be sure to review all past homework carefully. You can even login to Webwork as a practice user (username and password are both practice1, or if busy practice2, etc.) to get a new version of a problem. Reviewing homework problems and class notes is the best way to get ready for the exam because the practice problems above do not necessarily cover all the concepts for which you are responsible.

<P> <FONT COLOR=339E7A SIZE="+2"><B>Holistic Evaluation of Written Work</B></FONT><BR> We will be evaluating all written work in a holistic way. Toward that end, we have developed a set of guidelines that we will use in grading, and that you may use in developing your own written responses. You can learn from the <A HREF="eval/holisteval.htm">holistic evaluation document</A> just how we will be grading your work. Our aim is to establish a set of guidelines that we will all agree to follow. We have given examples for both 10-point and 50-point questions; however, we will scale the numbers according to how much a given question actually is worth. There should be little, if any, disagreement about the evaluation of a written assignment in Math 3.
