<Center><B>On-Line Version of the Textbook</B>
<P><I>Principles of Calculus Modeling<BR>
An Interactive Approach</I><BR>
by Donald L. Kreider and C. Dwight Lahr</Center>

<Blockquote>

The textbook for the course is a draft manuscript that is intended to be used interactively with the electronic version. You should <A HREF="../../../~calcsite/Textbook.html">download the e-version of the textbook</A> and save it on your computer. In that way, when you see references to resources on the Web, you can activate the links in the e-version and access them. In addition to finding the homework, you will be able to experiment with applets that have been specially designed to make calculus come alive. And by the way, we want your feedback. If you see a better way of doing something or if things are not working for you, do not hesitate to contact Dwight Lahr. Studying calculus should be fun, and we want to do everything we can to make it just that.

We believe that all calculus students should get some familiarity with a computer algebra system. Such systems allow one to draw graphs of functions, to find derivatives and integrals, and to implement many of the numerical techniques we learn in calculus. Maple is the Computer Algebra System we will be using in Math 3. You should install it on your computer.

<P>For installation instructions, go to the Mathematics Department <A HREF="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/software/">Software Resources</A> web page and look at the section on "Maple Information pages." In addition to containing installation instructions for Mac and PC users, it also gives the pointer to a start-up Maple Primer.

<P><Center><B>Math 3 Maple Files</B></Center>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Over the years, we have developed Maple versions of the Case Studies in Calculus that we will be studying. Many of them require that you have put the "Math 3 Maple Files" in the Maple folder of your computer. You can <A HREF="ftp://ftp.math.dartmouth.edu/pub/classes/calcsite/maple/calcfiles.sit">download the Math 3 Maple Files</A> as a folder that has been compressed in Aladdin's ".sit" format. It will need to be expanded with the latest <I>Stuffit Expander</I> on Macs or on PCs running Windows. 

<P>These expanders are free from Aladdin. We will be putting all compressed files included in the Math 3 website into ".sit" format, so be sure that you have a copy of the appropriate expander. If the free Aladdin expander is not on your computer, you can get it at the  <A HREF="http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/index.html"> Aladdin</A> website.

<P><Center><B>CSC Archive in Maple</B></Center>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This year, we will be completing the term's CSCs using software tools that we have developed especially for that purpose. However, we also have an archive of related CSCs developed exclusively in Maple. We encourage you to look at this archival material as you study the content of a given CSC. You may find it helpful. For the Maple versions of CSCs go to  the <A HREF="../../../~calcsite/index.html">Calcsite website</A> which we warn you is under continual construction.
