words of wisdom taken from the webpage of Dr. Dylan Retsek, one of

What is Calculus About?</font></font>

<ul><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">The seeds for the main ideas
of calculus go back to ancient times, but calculus itself, as we think
of it today, was invented (or discovered?) during the 17th century in response
to the needs of an emerging science.&nbsp; Its invention is usually attributed
to the English mathematician <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Newton.html">Sir
Isaac Newton</a> and the German mathematician <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Leibniz.html">Gottfried
Leibniz</a>, working independently. As its power developed, calculus gave
scientists a tool to generate remarkable new understandings of the world.
Its creation is considered one of the great intellectual accomplishments
of the human mind. This sweeping assertion is justified not only by the
beauty of the subject, but also by the fact that it still retains its fundamental
importance, even several centuries after its birth.&nbsp; In fact, its
role has become more important than ever as the use of mathematical models
has reached beyond areas such as physics and engineering and into such
fields as biology, economics and business.</font></font><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Of course there are also
other important mathematical tools.&nbsp; Algebra, discrete mathematics,
probability and statistics, topology, and computer science all have roles
to play, and these tools complement each other. The increasing power and 
availability of technology
enhances their usefulness and doesn't replace the need for any of them.

<a href="http://www.calpoly.edu/~dretsek/syllabus/winter05/calctech.html">Technological Tools</a>
to read more about how we will employ these tools.</font></font>



</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">There are lots of details
and techniques for us to learn, but in the big picture there are only two
"great&nbsp; ideas" in calculus.&nbsp; Both of them are illustrated on
the dashboard of your car.</font></font>
</p><blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first idea concerns "how fast is a quantity changing?"&nbsp; For example,
if you're driving down the highway and <i>s</i> represents the distance
you've traveled from home, then you might be interested in how fast</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"><i>s</i> is changing (measured,
perhaps, in km/hr).&nbsp; How fast
<i>s</i> changes over time is your velocity,
<i>v</i>.&nbsp;
Studying rates of change involves a concept from calculus called the <b>derivative</b>.
It's analogous to the <b>speedometer</b> on your car.&nbsp; Of course,
instead of how fast <i>s</i> is changing, you might be interested in the</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"><b>rate of change</b> of</font></font>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"><i>y</i> = the size of a population
of bacteria</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"><i>y</i> = the amount (mass)
of a radioactive isotope in a sample</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"><i>y</i> = the price of a gallon
of gasoline.</font></font></li>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Whether a rate of change occurs
in biology, physics, or economics, the same mathematical concept--the<b>
derivative--</b>is involved in each case.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The other idea is the "opposite" of the first one.&nbsp; If you know how
fast some quantity is growing, then how big is it at a certain time?&nbsp;
On the highway again, you could imagine trying to figure out how far <i>s</i>
you are from home at time<i> t</i> by studying the velocity <i>v</i> (speedometer
information).</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">This is easy to do if the
driver goes at <u>constant</u> velocity&nbsp; (in that case,<i> s = vt
</i>).&nbsp;
But finding <i>s</i> from <i>v</i> is harder if the velocity is always
changing during the trip. The calculation of a <b>total amount </b><i>s</i>
from a rate <i>v</i> involves a concept from calculus called the <b>integral</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's analogous to the <b>tripmeter,</b> which (if you set it to 0 when
you start out) measures
<i>s
</i>on your dashboard.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Instead of a distance, you
might be interested in trying to compute the<b> total amount</b> of money
in an account if you know how fast it's growing (the interest rate), or
the total number of people infected with some disease at time <i>t </i>if
you know the infection rate.&nbsp; The same mathematical concept, the<b>
integral,
</b>is involved in each case.</font></font></p></blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Nearly all of Math 141-142 consists
of</font></font><br>&nbsp;
<ul><ul><ul><ul><li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">developing the <i>background</i>
for these ideas</font></font></li><li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">developing the<i> mathematical
concepts of derivative and integral</i></font></font></li><li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">seeing <i>how the two ideas
are connected</i></font></font></li><li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">learning <i>techniques </i>for
applying the ideas efficiently.</font></font></li></ul></ul></ul></ul><p><br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">All of this is hard work.&nbsp;
But what did you expect in learning about "one of the great intellectual
accomplishments of the human mind"?&nbsp; The day to day work may seem
tedious at times, but it's essential, like finger exercises for the future
pianist. Or, to change the analogy, it's like learning a new language:
it can open new vistas but only if you're willing to memorize vocabulary,
learn to conjugate verbs, and practice, practice, practice!</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">We'll see indications of
some of the diverse applications of calculus during the course. But it's
not a course in physics, biology, economics, or business.&nbsp; Many of
the most interesting and significant applications you will have to meet
elsewhere.&nbsp; That should be a relief!&nbsp; It's certainly nice to
get ideas about what the material is good for, but students who want "more
applications" in math courses often don't realize that applications, generally,
are much harder: a little like "story problems", only worse. That's because
applying math to a concrete situation involves taking a complicated, messy
real-life situation, deciding what's relevant to the problem and what isn't,
creating a mathematical approximation ("model") to reality, and setting
up a mathematical formulation of the problem. Only at that point are you
ready to apply the "tools" from calculus. Setting up a mathematical model
in an application is often not easy, and it sometimes requires detailed
knowledge of another subject, such as physics or economics.&nbsp; In a
calculus course you learn the tools and see them applied in some "tidy"
applications which only hint at the real usefulness of the subject. The
biologists, chemists, physicists, engineers, architects, economists, and
others who have recommended that you take a calculus course will have to
show you the reasons why it's useful in their own fields (<i>please</i>,
<i>put
them on the spot and ask!! </i>)&nbsp; For now, try to learn to appreciate
the subject itself, its beauty, and how the pieces fit together.</font></font>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">E<font size="-1">xpectations and Advice</font></font></b></p></center><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">You'll probably find that
the material in most university courses, including this one, is covered
much more quickly than it would be in high school.&nbsp; You'll probably
also be asked to have a greater command of the material than before, especially
in understanding the ideas (not just the techniques) and applying them
in new situations. This may take some adjustments in your style of learning.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">The instructors
are here to help you understand and learn the material, but actually learning
it is your responsibility. The lectures are designed to try to highlight
the important ideas and give you some perspective on the material, so that
you can digest and really learn the material as you think, read the text,
discuss the material with other students, and practice on problems. <u>You
should expect that more of the learning will occur outside the classroom
than in it.</u>&nbsp; On the practical side, the average student should
expect to spend at least a couple of hours on calculus for every hour in
the classroom.&nbsp; If you do this for all your courses, then being a
student is the equivalent of a full-time job.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"><u>Read the text</u>. Your
instructor can't possibly say everything that's there. An hour's lecture
wouldn't be enough even to read the day's assignment aloud, let alone try
to highlight or clarify. Your instructor's job is to complement the text
so that you can learn from it.&nbsp; Simply relying on your lecture notes
will (and should!!!) probably only give you the highlights of the material.&nbsp;
To ignore the text is to start out looking for a minimal understanding.</font></font>
</p><p><u><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Reading a math text requires
active involvement and is often a slow process</font></font></u><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">.
You might spend a few hours reading an assignment of 100 pages in another
subject.&nbsp; A reading assignment of 10 pages of mathematics might take
just as much time.&nbsp; Read with scratch paper at hand and fill in missing
steps. When the author simply asserts&nbsp; "...this expression simplifies
to...", simplify it!&nbsp; When you read "you should check that...", check
it!&nbsp; Try to work some of the examples in the text before reading them.&nbsp;
Play with the material: ask yourself&nbsp; "what if I changed the problem
to...?".&nbsp; Write down questions that come to mind.&nbsp; If you can't
answer them, ask your friends. Try to understand why the assertions in
the text are true.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><ul><ul><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">One of the marvelous
features of mathematics is that you need not (perhaps should not!) trust
the author.&nbsp; If a physics book refers to an experimental result, it
might be difficult or prohibitively expensive for you to do the experiment
yourself.&nbsp; If a history book describes some events, it might be highly
impractical to find the original sources (which may be in a language you
do not understand).&nbsp; But with mathematics, all is before you to verify.&nbsp;
Have a reasonable attitude of doubt as you read; demand of yourself to
verify the material presented.&nbsp; Mathematics is not so much about the
truths it espouses but about how those truths are established.&nbsp; Be
an active participant in the process.</font></font></i><br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
E.R., Scheinerman, <u>Mathematics, A Discrete Introduction</u></font></font></i><br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Brooks/Cole, Pacific Grove, CA, 2000, p. xviii-xix.</font></font></i></ul></ul><p><br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Ideally, you should <u>read
ahead</u>.&nbsp; The lectures will be much more valuable if you have tried
to digest some of the material already.&nbsp; Also, you'll be able to judge
that some things on the board needn't be written down.&nbsp; For example,
you'll know that those formulas the instructor is writing on the board
are just the ones listed in the text.&nbsp; That frees you to think about
what's being said and not be always frantically transcribing material from
the board.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">If you choose to ignore the
advice about reading ahead, then at least read the material in the text
before trying to do the assigned problems.&nbsp; Some students start out
with the problems and when they get stuck, they page back through the text
looking for a formula or example to help.&nbsp; This puts the focus in
the wrong place.&nbsp; Simply being able to "do the problems" represents
at best a minimal strategy for the course. You do have to do problems,
and you do want to have certain technical skills that the problems sets
can help develop, but you also want to understand the material.&nbsp; Carefully
reading the text is essential for that.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">You can't learn to speak
French by merely sitting and listening, and you can't learn mathematics
by watching someone else do problems. You need to <u>do as many problems
as you can realistically find time to do</u>: the more, the better.&nbsp;
It's useful to work with other people on homework as long as you're involved
as an active partner. Compare solutions; ask each other questions; make
up quizzes for each other; agree on some extra problems to try together--such
as the review problems at the end of each chapter.&nbsp; Prod each other
to do the assignments!&nbsp; Do whatever helps!&nbsp; But all of this is
to improve your understanding: your study group isn't there at quizzes,
tests, or when you need your math in another course.&nbsp; See the syllabus
section <a href="http://www.calpoly.edu/~dretsek/syllabus/winter05/142hwk.html">Homework
Policy and Suggestions.</a></font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">There are facts and formulas
you need to have at your fingertips: that is, <u>there are some things
you simply need to memorize</u>.&nbsp; But that's only the beginning.&nbsp;
Formulas are just tools.&nbsp; Some routine problems, admittedly, are designed
merely to be sure you really can handle the tools, but when attacking a
non-routine problem, don't just try to hunt</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">around for a formula. To
quote an old but accurate text,</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><ul><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">"(the) time wasters are
the formula worshipers ... who spend more time hunting a magic formula
than they would need to analyze the problem piece by piece using simple
familiar methods and calculations ... it cannot be said too often that
the ability to understand and solve problems does not come by memorizing
formulas ... formulas are not substitutes for thought."</font></font></i></ul><p><br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Many problems on tests
will be "like" problems you've seen before.&nbsp; But some won't be.&nbsp;
This isn't grounds for complaining that "we never saw a problem like that
before."&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> If you can only do problems like ones you've seen
before, what's the point?&nbsp; </b>The purpose of the problems is to help
you understand the ideas and techniques, not merely to learn how to do
more similar problems.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"><u>Stay on top</u>.&nbsp;
Sometimes it's hard to keep up with everything, but it's important not
to fall behind in the course.&nbsp; A lot of the material we cover is interdependent,
and if you're not comfortable with the material from two days ago, today's
lecture might be totally incomprehensible.&nbsp; It's better to be a bit
ahead--the lectures will mean more and you've got a buffer when an emergency
strikes.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Also, there's a limit to
how fast you can digest material and learn actually to use it in your thinking.&nbsp;
Avoid cramming just before tests by staying on top of things.&nbsp; It
makes life much more pleasant.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Make use of your instructor.&nbsp;
 Office hours are set aside
specifically to see students; those times are for you!&nbsp; Most instructors
are also willing to set up special meetings with students as time permits.
Your responsibility is not to waste these times.&nbsp; Try to solve your
own problems first, together with your friends. What you learn that way
<u>will
be more valuable</u> than the same answer "given" by your instructor. Come to office hours or your discussion section prepared with specific
questions.&nbsp; Bring questions to your instructor <u>quickly</u>,
as soon as you realize there's some difficulty you can't resolve.&nbsp;
(It's hard for any instructor to cope with&nbsp; "I haven't understood
anything for three weeks"; we aren't magicians.)</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Finally, one last word.&nbsp;
Some of you have had some calculus already: this can be a blessing or a
curse.&nbsp; It's a curse if it makes you think you know more than you
do and traps you into slacking off until you suddenly realize you're in
trouble. Even if you do already understand what's being covered in class
and the homework, this shouldn't make you think there's nothing to learn.&nbsp;
Try instead some of the harder problems in the text so that the time's
not wasted.&nbsp; <u>If you're bored and want to talk about some harder
problems or find some extra reading, talk to your instructor</u>.&nbsp;
If you're serious, your instructor will probably be delighted!&nbsp; And,
if you're on top of the current material, then you have a great opportunity
to be helpful to some of your friends who are still working on it!</font></font></p></ul></body></html>
