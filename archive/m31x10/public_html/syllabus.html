<div align="left">Assuming we're all up to it, we will try
to cover
chapters 1-17 of the text (that's the basics of groups and rings) as
well as a bit of field theory.&nbsp; In
addition to learning a bit about abstract algebra, we want to learn to
read, write and speak mathematics.&nbsp; In particular, we want to
learn to write our own proofs that are elegant and efficient as well as
correct.<br>
