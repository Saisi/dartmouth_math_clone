<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">FINAL EXAM: </span>Our
final exam is Sunday, August 29th, from 3:00 to 6:00 in Kemeny 006.
&nbsp;The final is cumulative, but will concentrate on the final third
of the course.<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">SECOND MIDTERM RESULTS: </span>As
a whole the class did well on a very difficult exam. &nbsp;I am still
seeing some write ups which are way too messy and terse. &nbsp;At this
point in your careers, that is simply immature. &nbsp;I will take off
more points for poorly articulated work in the future. &nbsp;<br>

</small>



<ul>

  <small>



  </small><li><small>Here is a hist-o-gram of the scores on the second midterm (out of 125): <a href="exam2-dist.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a>.</small></li>

  <small>



  </small><li><small>For some brief solutions to the second exam, <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m31x10/xxx.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a>.</small></li>

  <small>



  </small><li><small>Here is a very rough estimate of your grade in the course based
on the total of your two exams and your homework score. &nbsp;I have
converted your raw score on the first 5 assignments to a number from
0-60 which is written on your exam. &nbsp; That gives you a total out
of a possible 75 + 125 + 60 = 260. &nbsp;A crude estimate of your grade
to date is as follows:</small></li>

  <small>



  
  
  
  </small>
  
  <ul>

    <small>



    </small><li><small>A: 217-260</small></li>

    <small>



    </small><li><small>B: 170-216</small></li>

    <small>



    </small><li><small>C: 144-169</small></li>

    <small>



  
  
  
  </small>
  
  </ul>

  <small>



  </small>
</ul>





<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>





<small>SECOND MIDTERM: </small></span><small>The
second midterm will be held in 111 Wilder from 4pm to 6pm on Wednesday,
August 4th. &nbsp;(This is the same room where the first midterm was
held and NOT our regular classroom.) &nbsp;Students with legitimate
conflicts, <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">and who have obtained pre-approval from their instructor in writing</span>,
can take the make-up from 6:30-8:30. &nbsp;The exam will cover
everything we have done on groups (that means through Friday's lecture
on July 30th and through and including Chapter 11 in the text).
&nbsp;The format of the second exam will be similar to the first.
&nbsp;Expect to be asked to state definitions and perhaps important
theorems such as The Fundamental Theorem for Finite Abelian Groups,
Cauchy's Theorem for Abelain Groups, etc.
</small>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">FIRST EXAQM RESULTS: </span>By
and large, the class did well for a first midterm. &nbsp;Everyone has
to work on their exposition. &nbsp;We are way past the point where
unjustified assertions suffice. &nbsp;It is especially unacceptable if
I can't follow your work. &nbsp;There will be more information shortly
concerning grades and the like, but for now, I have posted crude
solutions.<br>

  <small>

  </small><li><small>How are you doing grade-wise: It is a bit early to be giving out
letter grades -- after all this was the "minor midterm" to give folks
an idea of what to expect on the next midterm and final -- but I expect
you will want an estimate of where you stand after the exam. &nbsp;So I
am providing a crude conversion table for your raw score on the exam
(out of 75) to a letter grade. &nbsp;(Note that I haven't bothered with
pluses and minuses. &nbsp;I also haven't factored in the homework
scores, but on the first three assignments almost everyone is doing
very well, so including that data wouldn't change things significantly.)</small></li>





  <small>

  
  </small>
  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>





    <small>

    </small><li><small>A: 67-75</small></li>





    <small>

    </small><li><small>B: 40-66</small></li>





    <small>

    </small><li><small>C: 27-39</small></li>

<small>MINOR MIDTERM</small></span><small>: &nbsp;Our first midterm in Wednesday, July 21 from 4-6 in <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">111 Wilder</span>. &nbsp;(NOT in our usual room!) &nbsp;Students with legitimate conflicts, <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">and who have obtained pre-approval from their instructor in writing</span>,
can take the make-up from 6:30-8:30 in 006 Kemeny. &nbsp;The exam will
cover through and including Friday's lecture (on July 16th).
&nbsp;(That means through and including Corollary 4 of Lagrange's
Theorem.) &nbsp;You should expect problems similar to those on
homework. &nbsp;You should also expect to be asked to state some
definitions and to be familiar with the results proved in class.</small><br>
