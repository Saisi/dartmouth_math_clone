final exam covers the entire course: this includes sections 13.1 --
13.5, 14.1 -- 14.4, 15.1 -- 15.8, 16.1 -- 16.8 and most importantly
17.1 -- 17.9. &nbsp;Of course, you are not responsible with the bits of
these sections we skipped in the reading assignments given on the
homework page. (For example, we did not cover any of section 16.5.)
&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">You should definitely expect the final to be heavily weighted towards the end of the course</span>. &nbsp;The final is three hours long as will be held in Filene Auditorium in Moore Hall from 3-6 on Saturday, December 6th.<br>

was a very challenging exam with one problem, #4, which was designed to
really stretch people. &nbsp;Taking this into consideration, the
class's performance was good.<br>

  </small><li><small>Approximate grades to date: To <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">estimate</span>
your progress in the course, we have converted your webwork score on
the first 19 assignments to a score out of 15. &nbsp;We have done
similarly for your first 5 quizzes and your first 17 written homework
assignments. &nbsp;These scores have been written on the second page of
your exam together with a number representing the number of missing
written homeworks plus the number of written assignments that have been
recorded as a zero. &nbsp;Thus, m/n/l a+b means you got m/15 on
webwork, n/15 on the quizzes, l/15 on the written homework and our
records show you are missing a written assignments with b recorded as
`0'. &nbsp;If any of these numbers does not seem correct, please see
your instructor. Then based on the sum of these scores plus the scores
on your first two exams, the following cut-offs (rounded to a multiple
of 10) give a crude approximation to your grade so far in the course.</small></li>

<small>EXAM 2:</small></span><small>
&nbsp;The second exam will cover all of chapter 16 as well as 15.7
and
15.8. &nbsp;(Of course, you are only responsible for the parts
covered
by the readings listed on the homework page. &nbsp;So for example,
we
did not cover section 16.5 at all -- although your instructor may have
used some of that material for motivation in lecture.) &nbsp;Note
that
the exam will be held at the same time, 4:00 to 6:00, but in a <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">different
location</span>, Filene Auditorium in Moore Hall. &nbsp;You
will have the full two hours to work on the exam.<br>

following into a score out of ten: your webwork score on the first ten
assignments, your quiz scores on the first three quizzes, and your
scores on the first nine written homeworks. These three numbers have
been written <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">in
order</span>
on the scoring page of your exam. &nbsp;The fourth number written
there
is the number of written homework assignments that have been recorded
as missing. &nbsp;Based on the total (out of 130) of your exam
score
