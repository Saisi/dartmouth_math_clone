Number theory is a wide field that concerns the study of certain sets of numbers.  Principal among these is the set 
of positive integers.  Number theory has a long and rich history, 
encompassing work by such important mathematicians as Euclid, Euler and 
Gauss, and it has been called the "Queen of mathematics".  But 
fascinating work in number theory is still being done today.  Fermat's Last 
Theorem was a famous centuries-old problem that has recently been 
solved.  Many important unsolved problems still remain, like the 
twin prime conjecture, and the Riemann hypothesis.  Number theory has 
practical applications as well.  It provides the theoretical framework 
for our current standards of data encryption.  
Every time you make a purchase on the internet, you are using number 
theory!
<p>
This course will be a survey of elementary number theory.  Here, 
"elementary" refers to number theory that does not rely on other fields 
such as algebra, analysis, or geometry.  We will study primes and 
divisibity, congruences, arithmetic functions, cryptology, and other 
topics as time permits.
