<td>Logic</td>
<td>7/13</td>
<td>Find a sentence in a magazine or newspaper, and write it and its negation using the logical symbols that you've learned. Clearly indicate the
variables that you use. Include the original sentence, as well as the name and date of the magazine or newspaper along with the  name of the article in
which you found the sentence.</td>

<td>Probability</td>
<td>8/12</td>
<td>Analyze a real game that involves chance. Such games include poker, roulette, craps, or the lottery. Depending on which game you choose, you do NOT
have to provide a full analysis of the game, but you should provide a full description of the game that you choose. Incorporate the words "sample space," 
"event," "probability," and "odds" into your project. For example, if you decide to analyze a lottery that involves matching five numbers, where each
number is between 0 and 9, inclusive, you could describe the odds of winning the lottery and/or the probability of matching zero or one number. Include
the name of the game that you are analyzing.</td>

<td>The Mathematics of Finance</td>
<td>8/24</td>
<td>Leia, who is 25 years old, and Obi-Wan, who is 45 years old, are both planning to retire when they turn 65. In preparation for this, they want to
start saving some money now.
<ol>
<li>Han Solo is a broker who presents the following two annuities, each with an annual interest rate of 8%:
<br><br>
A. Invest $1200 at the <i>end</i> of each year.
<br>
B. Invest $600 at the <i>end</i> of each six month period.
<br><br>
Han suggests that they both opt for annuity A because putting away more money at one time grows faster than splitting up payments. Is he correct? Explain 
your answer.
<br><br>
<li>Now suppose that in addition to the two annuities that Han Solo has available, Leia and Obi-Wan also have the option of choosing an annuity from
Chewbacca, another broker. Chewbacca's annuities, each of which has an annual interest rate of 8%, are as follows:
<br><br>
C. Invest $1200 at the <i>beginning</i> of each year.
<br>
D. Invest $600 at the <i>beginning</i> of each six month period.
<br><br>
Assuming that both Leia and Obi-Wan want to maximize the amount of money that they will have for retirement, which annuity (from A, B, C, D) should each
select? Explain your answer.
