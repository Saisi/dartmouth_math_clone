<p>Homework will be assigned section-by-section but collected weekly, on Fridays.  I advise you to do it as we cover the sections as it might be a little overwhelming piled up at the end of the week.  Note also that showing work is very important because I will be giving a good percentage of problems whose numerical answer is in the back of the book.</p>

<p>A common complaint of students when assigned problems whose answers are not in the back of the book is that they have to do the problems without knowing how they are supposed to turn out.  To solve this difficulty (beyond the role of the examples in the book and lecture), your text includes practice problems at the beginning of each section's exercises which are fully solved just before the next section.  Take advantage of those as intermediates between examples (where you see the solution right with the problem) and odd-numbered exercises (where you have the answer but not the process).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Assignment 8, Due Friday, May 25</b></p>

<p>5.3 p 325 #6, 16, 23, 24, 25, 26<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #6 does not require computation.  For #16 the eigenvalues are given in the note preceding exercise 7; you still have to determine the multiplicities but this gives you a leg up on factoring the characteristic function.<br>
5.4 p 333 #3, 5, 13, 20, 21<br>
6.1 p 382 #6, 12, 25, 28, 30</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proof (due <font color="darkred">Wednesday, May 23</font> to allow for rewriting time):</p>

<p>Recall that the sum of two vector spaces is the collection of all sums of vectors in those spaces.  We make a more general definition:</p>

<p><b>Definition.</b> (i) Let W<sub>1</sub>, W<sub>2</sub>, ..., W<sub>k</sub> be subspaces of R<sup>n</sup> for some n. The <em>sum</em> of the W<sub>i</sub> is 
<center> &Sigma; W<sub>i</sub> = {w<sub>1</sub>+w<sub>2</sub>+...+w<sub>k</sub> : w<sub>i</sub> in W<sub>i</sub> for i between 1 and k}.</center>
(ii) R<sup>n</sup> is the <em>direct sum</em> of subspaces W<sub>1</sub>, W<sub>2</sub>, ..., W<sub>k</sub> if their sum is R<sup>n</sup> and their pairwise intersection is the zero vector (i.e., the intersection of W<sub>i</sub> and W<sub>j</sub> is {<b>0</b>} for all i not equal to j).</p>

<p><b>Theorem.</b> Let W<sub>1</sub>, W<sub>2</sub>, ..., W<sub>k</sub> be subspaces of R<sup>n</sup> that sum to R<sup>n</sup>.  Then R<sup>n</sup> is the direct sum of W<sub>1</sub>, W<sub>2</sub>, ..., W<sub>k</sub> if and only if the sum of the dimensions of the W<sub>i</sub> is n.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proof assignment:</p>

<b>Theorem.</b> Let V and W be vector spaces, and T: V->W a linear transformation.  Then<br>
(i) If U is a subspace of V, and we set T(U) = {<b>y</b> in W: for some <b>x</b> in U, T(<b>x</b>) = <b>y</b>}, then T(U) is a subspace of W.<br>
(ii) If Z is a subspace of W, and we set X = {<b>x</b> in V : T(<b>x</b>) in Z}, then X is a subspace of V.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Assignment 4, Due Friday, April 27</b></p>

<p>Chapter 3 assignment <a href="HWchp3.pdf">in pdf</a>.<br>
4.1 p 223 #8, 12, 21, 31, 32, 33, 34</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proof assignment: prove the following theorem.  Note that as it is an "if and only if" statement, you will have to show each condition implies the other (this will be easier separate than trying to do both directions at once).</p>

<p><b>Definition.</b> A <em>subspace</em> of a vector space V is a subset W such that <b>0</b> is in W and W is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication (i.e., if <b>u</b> and <b>v</b> are in W and c is a scalar, <b>u</b>+<b>v</b> and c<b>u</b> are also in W).</p>

<p><b>Theorem.</b> Let V be a vector space and W a subset of V.  W is a subspace of V if and only if W is nonempty and closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Assignment 3, Due Friday, April 20</b></p>

<p>1.9 p 90 #3, 5, 11, 18, 31, 32<br>
2.1 p 116 #2, 10, 12, 18, 19, 20<br>

<p>No proof this week because of Exam I.</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Assignment 2, Due Friday, April 13</b></p>

<p>1.4 p 47 #6, 8, 13, 18, 20, 26<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that for #6, 8 you aren't solving the system, just rewriting it.<br>
1.5 p 55 #8, 9, 17, 21, 25, 26<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For #25 and 26 (not 21, there's nothing in 21 you <em>could</em> really be formal about) you don't need to be formal.<br>
1.7 p 71 #2, 15-20, 36, 37, 38<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 15-20 you do not need any computation.  If you've really internalized the ideas of linear independence, only two of the six should take you more than a glance, and those will take a very small amount of mental arithmetic.<br>
1.8 p 79 #9, 16, 20, 24, 31, 32, 34<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally I also had #7, 8, 11, 29, and 30 in the assignment, so it would be good to look at those in particular (though you are responsible for all the material, not just the exact sorts of questions I give you for homework).</p>

<p>No proof this week, but rewrites of previous proof due.</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Assignment 1, Due Friday, April 6</b></p>

<p>1.1 p 11 #7, 15, 16, 17, 25<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For #17 remember to <em>explain</em>.<br>
1.2 p 25 #2, 8, 10, 16, 19, 23-26<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 23-26 be brief, these aren't formal proofs; you may find 25 useful for answering 26.<br>
1.3 p 37 #10, 13, 16, 20, 21, 25<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 20 be specific ("a plane" is not enough); in 25(a) note they are <em>not</em> asking about the span of {<b>a</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>a</b><sub>2</sub>, <b>a</b><sub>3</sub>}.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proof Assignment (keep separate from homework)<br>
Essentially, 1.2 #29, but a little more formal (see below). Hint: what gives a cap to the number of pivots, rows or columns?</p>

<p>Definition: A system of linear equations is <em>underdetermined</em> if it has fewer equations than unknowns.</p>

<p>Theorem: Any consistent underdetermined system of linear equations has an infinite solution set.</p>
