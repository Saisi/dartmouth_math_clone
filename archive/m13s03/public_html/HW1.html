<h1> Homework Due Friday March 28th </h1>

<p>The first three questions will be turned in on a separate piece of paper.

<p>1. Go to <a HREF="http://www.mxctc.commnet.edu/clc/survey.htm"> http://www.mxctc.commnet.edu/clc/survey.htm </a>, print out the sheet, fill out the inventory and turn it in.  Do you feel the survey is accurate?</p>

<p>2. Go  <a Href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/tlrcfm/personalthink.cfm?N2735591812680="> Here </a> and take the 15 question test.  Describe your results.  Do you feel this is accurate?</p>

<p>3. Which of the following most accurately reflects your thoughts after the first lecture?<br>
a)Umm...Makes me think of what would likely happen if I gave my dry erase board and marker to a monkey at the zoo.<br>
b)I would prefer something closer to the stereotypical calculus class...even if it is a bit less animated.<br>
c)Will take a little getting used to, but it beats just having the examples in the book re-explained. <br>
d)The professor has a pulse! I don't believe it! [Note: choosing this answer will not help your grade.]<br>
