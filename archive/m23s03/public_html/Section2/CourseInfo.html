Homework is assigned on a daily basis. The written assignments are due in class,
two periods after they were assigned. No late homework will be accepted without a
valid excuse.
Not only are the homework scores counted towards the final grade, but doing
the homework represents the best preparation for the exams and for the
class as a whole.


<br><br>
<b> Quizzes: </b>
About once every other week, announced or unannounced. 
Are not counted towards the final grade. Regard them as a way of monitoring 
your progress.


<!--
<br><br>
<b> Tutorial assistance:</b> 
Help with your homework will be available in 104 Bradley, 
Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday evening 7:30 - 9:30. 
Tutorials will begin on Sunday, September 29. 
Norman Bradley will be the tutor.

<br><br>
<B> Pieces of advice:</B> <br>
(1) Work hard from the very beginning. Do 
<I> not </I> let the material accumulate without working through it. As
we go along, it is <I> your </I> obligation to read the whole material 
of the assigned sections. Do not expect all the details to be covered in class.
<BR><br> (2) Do not hesitate to ask me questions (during the class,
after class, during review sessions). Come to the office hours. If you
have a schedule conflict, set up an appointment with me. (I am a very
flexible guy in this respect!)
<BR><br> (3) Read the university's honor principle. You
are allowed and I encourage you to discuss among yourselves the ideas
of the course, but the homework and the quizzes and the exams 
should reflect your <I> own </I> understanding of the subject.

<BR><BR>
I wish you an enjoyable semester!
