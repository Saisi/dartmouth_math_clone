<p>
Maple7 is available for students, and installation instructions 
have been posted on the 
<a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/software/">
department's software web page</a>.

You can learn a lot about Maple by reading its help... Learning Maple is not a
requirement for the class, and you can obtain maximum scores and achieve
complete understanding of the material without ever using this software.
Such type of knowledge may ease a bit your life in Math 23, or may come handy 
with other occasions during your study years. I encourage you to get
familiar with Maple.

Here is the link to a
<a href="http://www.cargo.wlu.ca/introMaple.html">
comprehensive introduction to Maple</a>.

<p>Finally, below are some graphs that I have obtained, 
using Maple (or Mathematica), when
I prepared the lectures for our class. Feel free to cut-and-paste any Maple
command contained in the files, and use them to start learning how to work 
with Maple.
