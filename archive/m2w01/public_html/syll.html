<b> Textbook: </b> <br><br>
<i>Calculus with Applications,</i> by Varberg and Fleming  
<br> The text is available at the Dartmouth Bookstore. 

<p>
<b> Homework:</b> <br><br>
Homework will be given every class period except Friday and will be due at the BEGINNING of the following class.  <b>LATE HOMEWORK IS NOT PERMITTED FOR ANY REASON.</b>  However your two lowest homework grades will be dropped to allow for missed assignments.  Expect to spend approximately three hours working on homework outside of class for every hour spent in class.


<p>

<b> Exams:</b>

<br>

<br>

There will be two exams during the quarter in addition to one final exam.  The first two exams will be held on Monday, January 29 and Monday, February 19.  Both exams will take place from 7:00 pm to 8:30 pm in Bradley 101. The final exam is scheduled by the registrar.  <b>IT IS DARTMOUTH POLICY THAT FINAL EXAMS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO RESCHEDULING SO PLEASE DO NOT MAKE YOUR PLANS TO LEAVE CAMPUS UNTIL THE REGISTRAR HAS ANNOUNCED THE SCHEDULE FOR FINALS.</b>

<p>

<br>
<br> 

<b> Weekly Quizzes:</b><br><br>

There will be a short quiz at the end of the last class of the week (usually Friday).  The quiz will cover the material from that week and will contain problems similar to those on the homework. <b> MISSING CLASS ON THE DAY OF A QUIZ WILL RESULT IN A SCORE OF ZERO ON THAT QUIZ.</b>

<p>

Quizzes will be given on Friday of each week, except for the week of February 5th.  That week the quiz will be given on Thursday, Febrary 8th due to Winter Carnival.

<p>

<b> Note about office hours:</b>

<br>

<br>

We encourage you to come to  our office hours if you have any questions.  You can also make an appointment if you can't make it during office hours--but don't forget about the tutorials.

<p>


<b> Grading: </b> 

<br>

<br>

Your final letter grade for Math 2 will be determined by the fraction of 480 possible points you earn.  The components of the total score are: 

<br>

<br> Hour Exam 1:  100

<br> Hour Exam 2:  100

<br> Final Exam:  150 

<br> 8 Quizzes: 80  (10 points each)

<br> Homework:  50 (2 points each)

<br>

<br> Total:  480

<p>

The 25 homework assignments will be graded given 0, 1, or 2 points as follows:

<br>

<ul>

<li>0 means major errors and/or little to show,

<li>1 means significant errors and/or partially complete,

<li>2 means substantially complete and correct.

</ul>

<p>

<b> Tutorials: </b> <br><br>
Tutorials are scheduled Sunday through Thursday nights from 7-9 pm in Bradley 102.  Tutorials are optional, but you are encouraged to use them to work on the homework or for help with the course material.  Additionally, the tutors are available on a limited basis to provide individual help to students who feel they need it.  Arrangements for individual tutoring should be made with the tutor. 

<p>
<b> Honor Principle: </b>
Dartmouth students are expected to adhere to the honor principle.  In this course, that means that while homework can and should be worked on and discussed with others, the work you hand in must be your own.  No copying!  All exams will be closed book and closed notes, and obviously no collaboration is allowed on exams.  Calculators are <b> NOT </b> permitted on exams.  

<p> <b> Special Needs: </b>
Any student with a disability for whom special accommodations would be helpful is encouraged to discuss this with the instructor as soon as possible.
