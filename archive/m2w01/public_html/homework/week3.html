We are all challenged on every hand to work untiringly to achieve excellence in 
our lifework.  Not all men are called to specialized or professional jobs; even 
fewer rise to the heights of genius in the arts and sciences; many are called 
to be laborers in factories, fields, and streets.  But no work is 
insignificant.  All labor that uplifts humanity has dignity and importance and 
should be undertaken with painstaking excellence.  If a man is called to be a 
street sweeper, he should sweep even as Michelangelo painted, or Beethoven 
composed music, or Shakespeare wrote poetry.  He should sweep streets so well 
that all the host of heaven and earth will pause to say, "Here lived a great 
street sweeper who did his job well."
-Martin Luther King Jr.
