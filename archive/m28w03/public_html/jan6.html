Combine sports teams into a tournament<br>2. Samples of tires into plans to mount them on cars for testing<br>3. Students into classes to compare teaching methods<br>4. Members of tennis club into pairs<br>5. etc.</ul><li>Enumerative Combinatorics - number of ways to achieve an arrangement.</li><li>Existance of an arrangement</li><ul>Example: Given 10 baseball teams and each team plays each other once,can all games be scheduled if the field is available only for 40 games?<br>&nbsp;</ul><li>Combinatoric problems have applications to probability, statistics, physics,biology, CS, chemistry, etc.</li></ul></ul>1.2 BASIC COUNTING PRINCIPLES<p>Problems to be discussed in class: #1, 3, 5, 6, 8<br>Homework:&nbsp; # 2,7,9,10<br>Extra Credit: #4<br>&nbsp;</body></html>
