This year the courseis being taught as a "guided discovery" course. This means that the primarytext for the course is a set of problems with just enough prose so thatthe problems will make sense. It is available at the course web page <a href="book.html">www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m28w03/book.html</a>inthe form of course notes. By working these problems, students will discoverfor themselves the main theorems of combinatorial mathematics (and theirproofs) and examples of how these theorems are used. Students are encouragedto work together on the problems. Students are expected to work as manyof the problems as they can and submit them. Certain problems will be designatedeach week in advance as "mandatory" problems. These problems will be gradedand returned to the student.<p>Class time will be devoted largely to a discussion of the problems andthe broad themes in combinatorial mathematics that the problems illustrate.This discussion will be split between whole class discussion, includingpossible student presentations of their ideas, and small group discussions.Students will be graded on class participation. Unfortunately, coming lateto class may disrupt small group discussions, and so this will have tobe reflected in the class participation grades of students who habituallycome late to class. Of course it is difficult to participate if one doesnot come to class at all, and so habitual absence will also be reflectedin the class participation grade.<p>I hope the following quote will inspire you to participate in this course.<blockquote><font color="#0000FF"><font size=+2>"Mathematics is not forspectators; in order to gain in understanding, confidence, and enthusiasmone has to participate."</font></font> M.A. Armstrong</blockquote><hr SIZE=0><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=4 WIDTH="100%" ><tr><th ALIGN=LEFT><a NAME="textbook"></a><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Textbooks</font></font></th></tr></table><p><b>Required</b><ul><li><i><a href="book.html">Combinatorics Through Guided Discovery</a></i> byKen Bogart</li></ul><hr SIZE=0><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=4 WIDTH="100%" ><tr><th ALIGN=LEFT><a NAME="lectures"></a><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>ScheduledLectures</font></font></th></tr></table><ul><li>MWF 11:15-12:20, Bradley 103</li><li>(xhour) Tuesday, 12-12:50 Bradley 103</li><br><b>Note:</b> X-hours will be used when the instructor has to be outof town and miss a class, when the class needs additional time workingtogether, for review and for other purposes.
