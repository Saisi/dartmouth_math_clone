<A NAME="syllabus"></A><BR>
<H3>Syllabus</H3>
The topic of the course is Single-Variable Calculus.  
Topics for this course include techniques of integration,
sequences and series, and the basics of R<SUP>3</SUP> 
including vector arithmetic.
In particular, we will cover most of Chapters 9 through 13 in 
the single-variable calculus textbook and most of
Chapter 1 in the multivariable textbook. 
<P>

In Chapter 9, "More Antidifferentiation Techniques,"
we will study some very important and powerful techniques for
evaluating integrals, including integration by parts,
partial fractions and trig substitution.
<P>

In Chapter 10, "Improper Integrals,"
we will study integrals over 'infinite' regions,
grapple with how such things can make sense and how to compute them.
We will also learn at an important tool for evaluating
certain limits, namely l'H&#244pital's Rule.
<P>

We will spend a lot of time in Chapter 11,
"Infinite Series."  We will learn what a mathematician means by
the word 'series,' how to determine when such things 'converge' and 
'diverge,' and consider special series called power series and 
Taylor series.  Taylor series allow us to find nice approximations 
to certain functions, which is one important reason
for studying series in the first place. 
After studying them, among other things you'll know how your calculator 
actually calculates things like sin pi.
<P>

In Chapter 12, "Differential Equations,"
we'll learn the basics of diff eqs and how to solve certain diff eqs
graphically via direction fields and symoblically via separation
of variables.
<P>

In Chapter 13, "Polar Coordinates," we'll learn the basics of 
this very different, but very important way of looking at the 
real plane, R<SUP>2</SUP>.  We'll also learn to do calculus in this new
coordinate system.
<P>

Finally, in Chapter 1 of the multivariable book, "Curves and Vectors,"
we'll look at the basics of R<SUP>3</SUP> with special attention given to 
a new object known as a 'vector.'  We'll learn about vectors and vector arithmetic
including addition and the three multiplications: scalar multiplication, 
dot product, and cross product.
We'll also learn how to find equations of lines and planes using
these operations on vectors.

<H3>Exams</H3>
As mentioned above, there will be two Midterm Exams and a Final Exam. 
The Midterm Exams have already been scheduled; 
the Final Exam will occur between March 12th and March 16th at the time and place 
regularly scheduled by the registrar.<P>

Unless reported to me before January 11th,
<B> a scheduling conflict is not a sufficient excuse to take
an exam at any time other than the official time listed below</B>.
The Final Exam will occur between March 12th and March 16th. 
If you must make travel plans before the schedule for final exams appears, 
<B>Do Not</B> make plans to leave Hanover on or before March 16th. 
The Final Exam <B>Will Not</B> be given early to accommodate travel plans.<P> 

For this course, no calculators or computers may be used during the exams.
Please keep this in mind while working on your homework.<P>

The exams will take place at the following times and places:<P>

<A NAME="classpart"></A><BR>
<H3>Class Participation</H3>

Class participation is an essential part of the course;  
mathematics is not a spectator sport.
For this course, class participation consists of class attendance, 
reading assignments, quizzes,  and homework problems.<P>  

You are expected to attend every class.  
You have invested a large sum of money for the opportunity to come to class and 
I will invest a large amount of time in preparing for class;  
I do not want any of us wasting the investments we have made.
<P>  

Reading assignments will be given daily and should be read <B>before</B> coming to class.
For some of my thoughts on reading mathematics texts, 
<A HREF="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~amcallis/docs/reading.html">click here</A>.
<P>  

Quizzes will be administered at the end of class on Monday covering material presented in 
class the previous week.
They will consist of a couple of questions and should only take 10 - 15 minutes to complete.  
If you do the homework for the lectures given the previous week (including Friday's homework), 
then you should do fine on the quizzes.
<P>  

Homework problems will be assigned daily and collected the following class period.  
Homework will be turned in and picked up from the boxes outside of Cook Auditorium.
Late homework will not be accepted and a grade of 0 will be assigned 
(of course, exceptions can be made for emergencies such as illness, death, natural disasters...).  
The solutions you present must be coherent and written in complete sentences whenever possible.  
Simply stating answers or turning in garbled, unclear solutions will result in a grade of 0. 
For further details consult the 
<A HREF="hw.html">Homework Schedule</A>. 
<SPACER TYPE="vertical" SIZE="10">
<P>


<A NAME="tutorials"></A><BR>
<H3>Tutorials</H3>
There is tutorial assistance available for Math 8.
The tutor is <A HREF="mailto: Nathan.C.Ryan@dartmouth.edu"> Nathan Ryan </A> 
and the tutorials take place on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings 
from 7:00 - 8:30 PM in 105 Bradley Hall.
<P>

Also, consider visiting the course <A HREF="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m8w99/chat/">Chat Page</A>.
This is probably a very good venue for those late night questions, especially those that arise 
the night before the exams...
<SPACER TYPE="vertical" SIZE="10">
<P>


<A NAME="calcs"></A><BR>
<H3>Calculators and Computers</H3>
Although these are wonderful tools, proficiency in their use is no replacement for genuine 
understanding of the concepts of calculus.  You will not be allowed to use these tools during 
quizzes and exams; these will be written so that you can do the problems without them.  
You are also encouraged to be careful in  how you choose to use these tools in doing your homework.  
The homework problems are intended to increase your understanding of the material and 
judicious use of these tools may be appropriate.  However, while doing your homework, 
you should also attempt to simulate to some extent the quiz/exam environment which will 
determine the bulk of your grade.<P>

During class, I will use Maple (a computer algebra system) to illustrate various ideas.
If you are interested, you can obtain a copy of Maple from the Public server;
basic instructions for downloading and using Maple can be found at:
<UL>
 <LI> <A HREF="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/projects/software/maple-mac.html">Maple for Mac</A>
        (keyserved)
 <LI> <A HREF="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/projects/software/maple-pc.html">Maple for PC</A>
        (keyserved)
 <LI> <A HREF="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/projects/software/mapleintro.pdf">Maple Primer</A> 
        (very basic, but useful)
</UL>
I will post the files I use in class with the homework problems.
You might find it beneficial to look at the files when reviewing your notes.
Sometimes it's interesting to see what happens when you make
small changes in commands.
<SPACER TYPE="vertical" SIZE="10">
<P>


<A NAME="honor"></A><BR>
<H3>Honor Principle</H3>
Work on all quizzes and exams should be strictly your own.<P>
Collaboration on homework is encouraged (and expected);  
although, you should first spend some time in individual concentration to gain 
the full benefit of the homework.  On the other hand, copying is discouraged.  
You should not be leaving a study group (or a tutorial) with your homework ready 
to be turned in;  write up your solution sets by yourself.
<SPACER TYPE="vertical" SIZE="10">

<A NAME="disabilities"></A><BR>
<H3>Disabilities</H3>
I encourage students with disabilities, including but not limited to disabilities like 
chronic diseases, learning disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities, 
and students dealing with other exceptional circumstances to come see me after class 
or during office hours so that we can make appropriate accommodations.
Also, you should stop by the <A HREF="http://www.dartmouth.edu/admin/acskills/">Academic Skills
Center</A> in Collis Center to register for support services.

<A NAME="questions"></A><BR>
<H3>Questions</H3>
If you have any questions about this syllabus or about the material presented in this course, 
come talk to me.  Although, I do enjoy mathematics, I am not here just to have fun.  
My primary goal is to help you learn and understand calculus.  
Your questions are an important part of your learning process, and I can help you find answers.
