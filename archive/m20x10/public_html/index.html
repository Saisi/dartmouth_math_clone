<p align="left">To practice for the final I suggest trying out the earlier homeworks, midterms and exercises from 5.1 (this is useful because it doesn't
mention which distribution to use, so it helps in practicing figuring out the distribution just like in a test). Section 11.2 has a lot of good exercises and 
I will likely grab a problem from this section (as I like it a lot). If you want to know if you are solving the problems correctly, feel free to email me or 
come to office hours (I will hold office hours on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday in the afternoon).
</p>

<p align="left"> Homework 8 is due on Wednesday August 26, 2009 (note that Homework 7 is due the same day, homework 8 is meant to represent class on Friday):<br>
Section 11.3: 1,2,3, 6, 24
</p>

<p align="left">Homework 7 is due on Wednesday August 26, 2009: <br>
Section 11.1: 2, 4, 8, 11, 19<br>
Section 11.2: 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 13, 15
</p>

<p align="left">Here's the solution to the <a href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m20x09/Solutions5.pdf">fifth homework set</a> <br>

<font size="4"><b>Grading</b></font></p>

<p>


The course grade will be based on: <br> Homework  15%, <br> Midterm 1    25% , <br> Midterm 2    25% 
and <br> Final Exam   35%.</p>

</UL>


<p>

<font size="4"><b>Homework</b></font></p>

<p>


There will be <a href="homework.html">homework</a> due 
roughly every week. It will consist typically of a reading assignment 
(of the part of the book covered in class) and some problems. Collaboration in 
the homework is permitted, 
but you are not allowed to copy someone else's work. The solutions must be 
written individually. You have to mention on your problem set the names of the 
students that you worked with.</p>

<p>

<font size="4"><b>Exams</b></font><br>
<br>
On the midterms and the final exam you must work on the problems on 
your own. <b>No collaboration permitted</b> in the exams<b>.<br>

The first midterm will be on Monday July 19, 2010 from 5pm to 7pm in Rockefeller Room 003.<br>
The second midterm will be on Monday August 09, 2010 from 5pm to 7pm in Rockefeller Room 003.<br>
