			<P CLASS="style5"><NOBR>Each of the two hour-exams will consist of two parts&#8212;a multiple-choice part and a non<BR>
			multiple-choice part where partial credit can be earned. The final exam will be multiple-<BR>
			choice. No calculators or computers will be needed or allowed in the sit-down exams.</NOBR></P>
			
			<P CLASS="style6"><NOBR>Twice-weekly Regular Homework Exercises:<BR>
			Homework will be assigned at class meetings and will be due on Mondays and Fridays</NOBR></P>
			
			<P CLASS="style7"><NOBR>before class. There will always be at least one class-day between the day homework is<BR>
			assigned and the day it is due, thereby providing plenty of opportunity for you to get your<BR>
			questions answered. You will turn in homework and pick up graded homework from the<BR>
			boxes outside the classroom. This homework will consist, typically, of exercises from the<BR>
			textbook that cover the major concepts that were introduced in class. It is important to<BR>
			complete the homework on time for the day it is due. If you do this, you will have reviewed<BR>
			the ideas covered in class and be ready for the new ideas to come. Remember that new<BR>
			mathematical ideas build on old ones. Only by staying up to date in the homework will you<BR>
			avoid getting lost.</NOBR></P>
			
			<P CLASS="style8"><NOBR>When we assign the problems, we will not have in mind drill and repetition. We are aware<BR>
			that you bring different backgrounds to the course, and that students will differ in their need<BR>
			to practice by doing problems on a given topic. Therefore, we will concentrate instead on<BR>
			pointing out problems that will be illustrative of the kinds that will appear on the exams.<BR>
			Typically, we will assign a half-dozen or so problems, sometimes fewer, on a given day. In<BR>
			some cases, particularly in introductory or review sections, more problems may be assigned<BR>
			to cover the many ideas introduced. We are leaving it to you to judge how well you can<BR>
			handle the problems given and whether you need more practice by choosing additional<BR>
			problems of the same type.</NOBR></P>

			example of using calculus to model real-world problems involving real data. During the<BR>
			term, you will produce and turn in reports on the CSCs. They will be due in weeks 6, 8, and<BR>
			9. Each of the CSCs will be developed over a three class-day period&#8212;introduced in class on<BR>
			the first day, and discussed further in class on the second day; your report will be due as<BR>
			homework on the third class day.</NOBR></P>
			
			<P CLASS="style8"><NOBR>A CSC topic begins with the statement of a background situation that comes from a field<BR>
			outside of mathematics such as biology or physics, and that involves real data. In each CSC,<BR>
			you will be learning to set up a mathematical expression that addresses some of the issues.<BR>
			You will also get experience exploring mathematical ideas by drawing graphs, or generating<BR>
			numbers, or doing algebra, or applying calculus. Finally, you will be learning to report on<BR>
			what has been learned and what relevance the mathematical outcome has to the original<BR>
			situation. Indeed, the completed report on the CSC will be a discussion of mathematical<BR>
			modeling and the scientific method. The CSC is intended to illustrate the power of calculus<BR>
			as a modeling tool in a variety of contexts.</NOBR></P>
