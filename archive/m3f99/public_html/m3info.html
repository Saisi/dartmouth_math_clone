<P>
On the following pages, we have put <A HREF="informationAbout/info.html">Information About Math 3</A>. This five-page document contains everything you want to know about the course: for example, when and where it meets, the names and office hours of the instructors, the course requirements, dates and times of the exams, and the Academic Honor Principle as it applies to the course. It also contains helpful hints on how to study.</P> 

<P>
What the document does not specifically say is that the two sections of the course behave as one. That is, all of the required work is the same, as is the material that is covered. The grades are assigned as if all students were attending the same class. So, you should feel free to talk to any of us, even though you probably should seek out your own instructor first because we want to get to know as many of you as possible.</P>

<P>
Have a good term. We look forward to working with you.</P>
