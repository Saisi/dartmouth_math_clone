<BLOCKQUOTE>Homework is due twice a week, on Mondays and Fridays before class. Homework assigned on Monday is
due on Friday; homework assigned on Wednesday is due the following Monday; and homework assigned on Friday is
due the next Friday. Use the labelled homework boxes in the front (section 2) or back (section 1) of 101 Bradley (formerly Filene)
Auditorium for submitting and picking up graded homework. New homework will be added below
weekly.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<B><FONT FACE="Times"><P>#0&#9;On Wednesday, September 22, the day of the first Math 3 class:</P></B><DIR> 
</B><P>Go to the "Maple" section of the Math 3 website and read the document "Getting started with
Maple." First, follow the instructions for loading Maple onto the hard disk of your computer. Next, follow the
instructions for customizing Maple for calculus, returning to the "Maple" section of the website and
downloading the "Math 3 Maple files." Finally, follow the directions for trying out Maple. <B>Only if you
experience problems should you go to the Help Session on Thursday in Bradley 101, 4:00-5:00 or 5:00-6:00.</B>
Otherwise, you are ready for class on Friday.</P></DIR>

(c) Illustrate your work in part (a) by printing a copy of the slope field of part (b) and drawing on it the line segments that approximate the graph of <I>y</I> from <I>x</I>= -1 to <I>x</I> = 3.<BR>
(d) Use Euler's Method with step sizes of first  <I>h</I> = .5 and then <I>h</I> = .1 to find better approximations to the graph of <I>y</I> from <I>x</I> = -1 to <I>x</I> = 3 by modifying and implementing the Maple code from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.math.dartmouth.edu/pub/classes/m3f99/demos/

This week we have made some minor adjustments to the Day-by-Day syllabus to ensure that there is sufficient time to do justice to the CSC. All departures from the syllabus are noted below.

<BR>

<B><FONT FACE="Times"><P>#23&#9;Monday  11/15  (due 11/19)</P><DIR>

</B><P>&#149; &#167;&#167;6.1, 6.6; omit &#167;6.7: <BR>p.337 [44,47]
<BR>p.351 [1,2,5,7] <BR>p.390 [5]
<BR>Also, complete the following problem:
<BR><DIR> 
	(a)  Write out the trapezoidal approximation T5 to 
 the integral from 0 to 1 of exp(-x^2) dx .<BR>
	(b)  Evaluate T5 using Maple. [Don't forget thet you will have to precede your "trapezoid(f(x),x=a..b,n);" command-line with the line "with(student):" and that you will have to use the "evalf()" command to get a decimal approximation.]<BR>
	(c)   Approximate the integral from 0 to 1 of exp(-x^2) dx 
to three decimal places by evaluating Tn using some values of n > 5.
