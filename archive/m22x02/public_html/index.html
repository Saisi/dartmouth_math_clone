Lay</h3><hr><hr><p><b>Homework</b>: Our homework grader is Zeynep Oz.  She will be asked to grade   each set on a basis of two points each. Essentially correct work rates 2, incorrect   work rates 0, and something in between rates 1. Homework does not count for   the final grade unless you end between two grades. Then homework will move you   to one or the other. Do the homework even though it may not count for the final   grade! There is ample evidence to show that those who do badly on the homework   also do badly on the final grade. </p><hr><h2 align="center">Homework Assignments</h2><p align="left">Assignment due Monday, July 1<br></p><p align="left"> Section 1.1: page 10: 6, 7, 11, 15, 17, 21 23, 33 <br>  Section 1.2: page 25: 6, 8, 12, 14, 17, 20, 21, 25, 26, 31, 32 </p><hr>  <p align="left">Assignment due Monday.
