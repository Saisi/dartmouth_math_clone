<U><P>Is Zeno's Achilles paradox, in either of its two formulations, transparent?</P>
</U>

<DIR>

<P>&#9;Not at all. The paradoxes raise fundamental issues about space, time, and infinity, a word we have been careful not to mention until now. The two resolutions of the Achilles paradox that we discuss above rely on mathematics that was not developed until the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century. Georg Cantor developed the theory of sets, and especially infinite sets, at the end of that century. His work made clear the concept of one-to-one correspondence as the appropriate tool for comparing the sizes of two sets. The lines through the common point at the top of the triangle in our first sketch establish a one-to-one correspondence between the points of AC and those of BC. The material on geometric sums involves the concept of limit that is fundamental to the study of calculus, but was not put on a firm foundation until that same century. And that is not the end of the story. As we will see in the next section, issues raised by Zeno are still with us to this day.</P>
