</U><P>(a)&#9;Why does Galileo abandon the characterization of motion given by Aristotle? </P>
<P>(b)&#9;What does he replace it with?</P>
<P>(c)&#9;What is the role of Time in Galileo's laws for the motion of an object falling near the surface of the earth?</P>
<P>(d)&#9;Find an explicit formula for the speed of a falling object as a function of distance.</P>
<P>(e)&#9;Aristotle said that the speed of a falling object increased directly in relation to the distance traveled. Was he correct?</P>
<P>(f)&#9;Is the mass of a falling object a factor in determining when it hits the ground?</P>
<P>(g)&#9;What is the role of force, and how does it relate to time?</P>
<P>(h)&#9;According to Newton, do all clocks measure the same Time?</P>

<DIR>

<P>And here have I the daintiness of ear</P>
<P>To check time broke in a disordered string,</P>
<P>But for the concord of my state and time,</P>
<P>Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.</P>
</DIR>
<P>i.&#9;How can time break? What is the meaning of broken time? What is Richard's "true time"?</P>
<P>ii.&#9;What is the relationship between Richard's time, Bolingbroke's time, and Time in Shakespeare?</P>
<P>iii.&#9;What is the meaning of Richard's metamorphosis into a clock? What time does it measure?</P>
</DIR>

</U><P>(a)&#9;What was Descartes' Method?</P>
<P>(b)&#9;How was it related to geometry?</P>
<P>(c)&#9;How was it used to develop a new kind of geometry?</P>
<P>(d)&#9;How did he apply it to his philosophical investigations?</P>
<P>-&#9;to his conception of time?</P>
<P>-&#9;to his conception of the universe?</P>
<P>-&#9;to the human body?</P>
