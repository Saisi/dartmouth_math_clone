<P>Question 1:&#9;What sort of reality does today's modern art reflect? What does it tell us about how we see time today? (This is a student question from the website.)&#9;&#9;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Question 2:&#9;One definition of time is that it is that which is measured by a clock. But we use clocks to measure things as diverse as the giving of a speech, the running of a race, the boiling of an egg, the taking of a nap. What then would you describe as the nature of time according to this definition?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Question 3:&#9;What different conceptualizations of time can you come up with based on  your own experience?</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">[Cf. All course readings and discussions to date.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Question 4:&#9;How can you argue in favor of, or against, the independent existence of time?</P>
