href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/ap/science/story.html?s=v/ap/19990219">Scientists Slow Light To a Crawl By TOM KIRCHOFER
Associated
	Press Writer</a>: This is the article, suggested by your classmate,
that speaks of
	the experiments with the speed of light conducted at the Rowland
Institute for 
	Science in Cambridge and Harvard University. In commenting on this article, Professor Mook has said: "As I understand this, it is just a super, super refractive index. Light is being slowed down by passage through a medium--no big deal. What is big news here is that the speed is incredibly slow. But there is nothing to undo Einstein's second postualte or Maxwell's equations. Actually the second postulate is just a special case of  the first postulate: the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames. Since Maxwell's equations predict a speed for light that is independent of the motion of the source or reciever of the light, Einstein's second postulate follows immediately. And there has never, ever been any evidence that Maxwell's equations are in error. They are the only part of "classical" physics that has survived relativity theory unscathed."</p>
