<DIR> <P>Topic 2</U>: The Two Cultures: [From page 16, C.P. Snow] </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2><DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>There seems to be no place where the [two] cultures meet. &#133; The
clashing point of two subjects, two disciplines, two cultures--of two
galaxies, so far as that goes--ought to produce creative chances. In the
history of mental activity that has been where some of the break-throughs came.
The chances are there now. But they are, as it were, in a vacuum, because those
in the two cultures can't talk to each other. It is bizarre how very little of
20<SUP>th</SUP> century science has been assimilated into 20<SUP>th</SUP> century
art. &#133; It [science] has got to be assimilated along with, and as part and
parcel of, the whole of our mental experience, and used as naturally as the rest.

answer questions you may have. These sessions will take place on Tuesday, March 2
and on Thursday, March 4 in Filene. The sessions will occur on both days from
6:00 to 7:00 p.m. and from 7:00 to 8:00 p.m. Attend whichever you like.</P>

<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2> <P>*&#9;Always proofread.</P>

<P>*&#9;Citations:  most of you are not using the correct format for citations. 
All direct quotations and paraphrases <B>must</B> be followed by a citation. 
Instructions for how to cite everything from poems to class lectures to
information off the web (yes, all must be cited) is available in the booklet
"Sources: Their Use and Acknowledgment," which you received at the beginning of
your first year here.  If you no longer have this book, the same information is
available on the web at www.darmouth.edu/~sources.  Remember that, if you want to
save space in your paper, you can use footnotes instead of the more familiar
parenthetical notations.  Footnotes and bibliographies can appear on a separate
page from your essay.</P>

<P>Although we have been lenient about citations in previous assignments, we
expect you to cite correctly from now on, and you will be penalized if you fail
to do so.  Carelessness is unacceptable.</P>

<P>*&#9;Thesis statements.  Many of you are still having trouble with your
theses.  A thesis should be well-developed and specific.  It should provide a
controlling idea/argument that guides the rest of the essay.  A thesis like
"Although the concepts of infinity, immortality, and eternity have many
similarities, they are also all different" (many of you used some variation of
this for your thesis in the midterm) is too vague and general to give your paper
direction and punch.  Where will you go from here?  What will your paper's
structure be?  What is the <B>idea</B> behind your paper? Your thesis statement
should give the reader some idea of these things.</P>

<P>A better thesis would say something like:  "Although the concepts of infinity,
immortality, and eternity all deal with limitlessness, infinity is ... whereas
eternity ...  Immortality relates to both because ..."  A statement like this
implies a structure for the rest of the paper, and it makes it easier to discuss
the readings because you know what you have to use them to prove.</P>
