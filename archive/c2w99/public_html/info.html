<B><U><P>Teaching Assistants</U>:</B> Mary F. Brown, Erica Christensen, Maya Haberland, Javier Romero</P>
<B><U><P>General organization</U>:</B> </P>
<P>The class will meet three days a week. Two of these meetings will follow a lecture format alternating between instructors. The Friday session will usually combine joint presentations by the instructors and open student discussion. If you would like to suggest a question or topic for the Friday Discussion, you should post it on the course website (see address below) by early Thursday morning. The topics to be addressed during the Friday Discussion will be posted on the website by Thursday afternoon. All students should review the topics for the Friday Discussion before coming to class.</P>
<B><U><P>Course Website</U>:</B> </P>
<P>The address of the <I>COCO 2 - A Matter of Time</I> website is <A HREF="coco2.html">http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w99/coco2.html</A>. We will use it as an integral part of the course, so you definitely should check it out right away.</P>
<B><U><P>Assignments and grades</U>:</P>
</B><P>In addition to completing all reading assignments by the due-date, students will be expected to participate actively in class discussions, especially the Friday Discussions. In weeks three and seven, a one-page, double-spaced, written assignment will be due addressing one of the questions/topics of a previous Friday Discussion. There also will be a mid-term examination and a final six-page paper. The questions for the take-home mid-term will be handed out the week before, and the written responses, limited to two pages, will be collected on Monday. The two one-page written assignments will account for 30% (15% each) of the final grade; the Mid-term will be 30% of the final grade; and the final paper 40%.</P>
<B><U><P>Discussion Sessions</U>: </P>
</B><P>The Teaching Assistants will be organizing a number of discussion/help sessions for the weeks before the Mid-term and the Final paper are due. The purpose of these sessions is to review course material and give advice that can help you do a good job on these assignments. </P>
<B><U><P>Meetings with your instructors</U>:</P>
</B><P>You should not hesitate to contact either one of your instructors about issues related to the course. You can send e-mail messages to us, make appointments, or drop into our scheduled office hours.</P>
<B><U><P>Academic Honor Principle</U>:</P>
<P>On written assignments, including exams</B>:<B> </B>Feel free to brainstorm with fellow students, Teaching Assistants, or your instructors. However, when you sit down to write your responses or your paper, you must do so on your own and in your own words. The end result is that we expect written responses and papers to be unique pieces of writing. No exchanges of electronic files are permitted.</P><DIR>
