<U><P>Formulation Number One of Zeno's Achilles Paradox</U> </P>

<DIR>

<P>&#9;Suppose Achilles and the tortoise are having a race. Because the tortoise obviously moves more slowly than Achilles, the tortoise is given a head start. Let's assume that at the beginning of the race, Achilles is at point A and the tortoise is at point B.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;Now, we will argue that it is impossible for Achilles to ever overtake the tortoise. For, suppose Achilles overtakes the tortoise at point C. Then the infinite set of points on the line AC would have to exactly equal the set of points on the line BC. This is true because to every point-position of Achilles on line AC there corresponds a unique point-position of the tortoise on line BC, and vice versa, since they are covering these distances at the same time. Thus, the aggregate of the points on line AC equals the aggregate of the points on line BC, thereby seemingly leading to the paradoxical conclusion that line AC is equal to line BC.</P>

<U><P>Questions and comments to think about:</P>

</DIR>

<OL>

</U><LI>In the above drawing, is there a difference between these two concepts: <I>the</I> <I>distance between the points B and C,</I> and <I>the set of points on the line BC</I>?</LI>
<LI>Does a point on a line have any size?</LI>
<LI>In common English usage, we sometimes say <I>total</I> instead of <I>aggregate</I>. We also say total when we mean the result of adding a column of numbers. In the above paragraph, is <I>aggregate</I> related to an <I>arithmetic sum</I>? Explain.</LI>
<LI>Look at the following sketch and see if it helps resolve the paradox. That is, is there any contradiction when Zeno says that <I>the aggregate of the points on line AC equals the aggregate of the points on line BC</I>? How do we interpret <I>equals</I> here? How do we interpret <I>equals</I> when we say that a dozen oranges equals a dozen apples?</LI></OL>
