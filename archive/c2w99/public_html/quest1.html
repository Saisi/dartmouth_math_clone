<P>Question 1:&#9;To what extent do we/should we accept an arbitrary time keeping system?</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<U><P>Related Issues</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</U><P>(a)&#9;How arbitrary are our time measurement systems?</P>
<P>(b)&#9;Does time measurement historically evolve in the direction of arbitrariness?</P>
<P>(c)&#9;Does it make any difference in terms of people's experience of time and/or the meaning of time for individuals or society how arbitrary a time measurement system is?</P>
</DIR>

<P>Question 2:&#9;Does the discovered utility of a time keeping system justify our subjection to artificial time units such as the week?</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<U><P>Related Issues</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</U><P>(a)&#9;Frame of reference for the question of utility: against what standard are we measuring utility?</P>
<P>(b)&#9;Frame of reference for the question of justification: practical, artistic, ethical, individual, social, standard of living, quality of life, &#133; etc.?</P>
</DIR>

<P>Question 3:&#9;What is the difference between correlation and cause-and-effect? Take the 7-day week as an example.</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<U><P>Related Issues</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</U><P>(a)&#9;The Babylonians invented the 7-day week and dedicated each day (don't forget that the word for <I>day</I> in the Sumerian and Akkadian languages was <I>wind</I>) to a different wind.</P>
<P>(b)&#9;The Hebrews adopted the Babylonian 7-day week to mark the period between Sabbath days.</P>
<P>(c)&#9;The choice of the number 7 could be related to the widespread attention of ancient astronomers to the five heavenly bodies which changed their places in relation to the so-called fixed stars: Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars which together with the sun and the moon added up to 7.</P>
<P>(d)&#9;Recent chrono-biological studies show that most organisms respond to the circaseptan: a biological variation of rhythms with a frequency of one cycle in about seven days.</P>
<P>(e)&#9;Is the 7-day week "all culture and no nature," or is it grounded in the biology of living organisms?</P>
</DIR>

<P>Question 4:&#9;How do we read the 7 days of creation in Genesis?</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<U><P>Related Issues</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</U><P>(a)&#9;Do they make sense geologically? Can they correspond to any geological time scale?</P>
<P>(b)&#9;Can we read them from an evolutionary perspective?</P>
<P>(c)&#9;Are they a symbolic representation of time and if so: What is their meaning? What kind of agenda do they relate to?</P>
</DIR>

<P>Question 5:&#9;Norbert Elias defines knowledge as "the development of means of orientation." How does a means of orientation like <U>time</U> come about?</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<U><P>Related Issues</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</U><P>(a)&#9;By what process does a means of orientation such as <U>time</U> devised and shared by a few become a solidly accepted social phenomenon?</P>
<P>(b)&#9;Can you think of a comparable process in our own time?</P></DIR>
