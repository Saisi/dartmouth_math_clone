Topics: In this course, we will discuss applications
of various mathematical techniques, such as differential
equations, probability theory, Markov chains, chaos
theory and graph
theory, in psychology, sociology, anthropology, etc.
<br><br>
Text: Selected readings will be distributed. <br><br>
Grading: Homework will be assigned (nearly) daily,
and will generally be due one week after it is assigned.
There will be no exams.
Students will also complete a research paper.  
This research may involve a survey of known results,
an investigation into the applicability of a certain model
to various applications,
a comparison of various models to a particular application,
the development of a new model, etc. Collectively,
the homework will account for 80% of the final grade,
and the paper will account for 20%.
