<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">FINAL EXAM: </span>The
final exam is Sunday, August 29th, from 11:30 to 2:30 in Kemeny 105
(our usual classroom). &nbsp;Although the final is cumulative, it will
concentrate on the final third of the course.<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">SECOND EXAM RESULTS: </span>The
results on the second exam were mixed, although the class as a whole
did well. Some write-ups are still lacking in detail. &nbsp;For
example, on problem 2, some people just wrote down answers without any
justification. &nbsp;We should be beyond that by now!<br>

  <small>
  </small><li><small>To obtain a very crude estimate of your grade in the course to
date, I have written a score from 0-80 on the second page of your exams
reflecting your homework scores. &nbsp;Adding this to your two exam
scores gives you a number out of 280. &nbsp;Based on the number you can
estimate your standing as follows:</small></li>

  <small>
  </small>
  
  <ul>

    <small>
    </small><li><small>A: 242-280</small></li>

    <small>
    </small><li><small>B: 197-241</small></li>

    <small>
    </small><li><small>C: 175-196</small></li>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">SECOND EXAM: </span>Our
second exam will be Monday, August 16th from 4-6 in 008 Kemeny Hall.
&nbsp;Students with legitimate conflicts, and who have
received permission from me in writing, can take the make up from
6:30-8:30. &nbsp;The exam will cover up to and including Wednesday's
lecture on August 11th. &nbsp;(Please note that I will not be available
for office hours all day on Friday August 13th). &nbsp; &nbsp;As on the
first test, in addition to questions similar to those on homework, you
can expect to be asked to state basic definitions and results from
lecture.</small>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">FIRST EXAM: </span>On
the whole, the class did well for a first exam. &nbsp;Most people still
need to take much more care on their exposition. &nbsp;Here are some
links you may find useful:<br>

  <small>


  </small><li><small>Although it is premature to think about grades after just one
exam, I have provided a crude guideline to convert your current
homework and exam scores to a letter grade. &nbsp;First, I have
converted your first 4 returned homeworks to a score out of 30 (written
on your exam). &nbsp;Then based on the total (out of 130), you can
estimate your current standing by:</small></li>



  <small>


  
  
  </small>
  
  
  
  <ul>



    <small>


    </small><li><small>A: 111-130</small></li>



    <small>


    </small><li><small>B: 87-110</small></li>



    <small>


    </small><li><small>C: &nbsp;77-86</small></li>

<small>FIRST MIDTERM</small></span><small>:
The first midterm will be Monday, July 26th, from 4:00 to 6:00 in 008
Kemeny Hall. &nbsp;Students with legitimate conflicts, and who have
received permission from me in writing, can take the make up from
6:30-8:30 in 006 Kemeny. &nbsp;(Note that the two rooms are different
and that neither one is our usual classroom.) The exam will cover up to
and including Wednesday's lecture (July 21st). &nbsp;This means up and
including section 2.3 in the text. &nbsp; In addition to questions
similar to those from homework and the workshops, you should expect to
be asked to state basic definitions and results from lecture.</small><br>
