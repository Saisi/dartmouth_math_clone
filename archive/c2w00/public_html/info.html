<P>We both encourage you to contact us by e-mail for purposes of asking
questions, making comments, or setting up meetings.</P> <B><U><P>Teaching
Assistants</U>:</B> Shalom Black, Daniel Hotard, Halia Koo, Patricia Kupfer</P>
<B><U><P>General organization</U>:</B> </P> <P>The class will meet three days a
week. Two of these meetings will follow a lecture format alternating between
instructors. The Friday session will usually combine joint presentations by the
instructors and open student discussion. If you would like to suggest a question
or topic for the Friday Discussion, you should post it on the course website (see
address below) by early Thursday morning. The topics to be addressed during the
Friday Discussion will be posted on the website by Thursday afternoon. All
students should review the topics for the Friday Discussion before coming to
class.</P> <B><U><P>Course Website</U>:</B> </P> <P>The address of the <I>COCO 2,
Winter 2000 - A Matter of Time</I> website is <A
HREF="index.html">http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/</A>.
We will use it as an integral part of the course, so you definitely should check
it out right away and add it to your bookmarks.</P> <B><U><P>Assignments and
grades</U>:</P> </B><P>In addition to completing all reading assignments by the
due-date, students will be expected to participate actively in class discussions,
especially the Friday Discussions. There also will be four take-home writing
assignments. In weeks three and seven, a two-page, double-spaced, paper will be
due addressing one of the questions/topics of a previous Friday Discussion.
Furthermore, there will be a mid-term examination, and a final paper. The
questions for the mid-term will be handed out the week before, and the written
responses, limited to five double-spaced pages, will be collected on Monday. The
final will be a seven-ten page double-spaced paper due on the first day of final
examinations. The two two-page written assignments will account for 30% (15%
each) of the final grade; the Mid-term will be 30% of the final grade; and the
final paper 40%.</P> <B><U><P>Discussion Sessions</U>: </P> </B><P>The Teaching
Assistants will be organizing a number of discussion sessions on Tuesdays during
the x-hour. The purpose of these sessions is to discuss course material and to
provide a forum in which students can talk in smaller groups. They will occur in
weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9. Note that this schedule will give ample opportunity to
brainstorm about the written assignments that are due in weeks 3, 5, 7, and 10.
</P> <B><U><P>Meetings with your instructors</U>:</P> </B><P>You should not
hesitate to contact either one of your instructors about issues related to the
course. You can send e-mail messages to us, make appointments, or drop into our
scheduled office hours.</P> <B><U><P>Academic Honor Principle</U>:</P> <P>On
written assignments, including exams</B>:<B> </B>Feel free to brainstorm with
fellow students, Teaching Assistants, or your instructors. However, when it comes
to writing up your responses or your papers, you must do so by yourself without
outside assistance and in your own words. In this regard, it is a violation of
the Honor Principle to share electronic files or notes, or to participate in
editing a joint document. You must produce by yourself all work written for
submission, and there should be no doubt that this is what we expect.</P><DIR>

<U><P>Physically Disabled and Learning Disabled Students</U>:</P> </B><P>We
encourage students with disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities such as
chronic diseases, learning disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities, to discuss
possible accommodations with one of your instructors. To receive special
accommodations, students must be registered with the Academic Skills Center;
contact the Student Disabilities Coordinator, Nancy Pompian, at extension 6-2014,
for more information.</P> <P>
