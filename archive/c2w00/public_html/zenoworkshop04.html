<OL>
<LI>Some mathematical notation can be helpful here: <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image4.gif" WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13>means multiply 2 times itself <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image5.gif" WIDTH=9 HEIGHT=9>times. So, <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image6.gif" WIDTH=69 HEIGHT=13>, <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image7.gif" WIDTH=85 HEIGHT=14>, <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image8.gif" WIDTH=109 HEIGHT=14>. What is <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image9.gif" WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13>?<BR>
<BR>
Also, an arithmetic fact is that <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image10.gif" WIDTH=52 HEIGHT=32>. Check it; both the left-hand and right-hand side of the equation equal 1/4. Similarly, <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image11.gif" WIDTH=51 HEIGHT=32>. Check it. What is the value?<BR>

<BR>
Sum of distances traveled by Achilles:<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image14.gif" WIDTH=141 HEIGHT=32><BR>
<BR>
Sum of distances traveled by Tortoise:<BR>

<LI>The above sums (that are unending and go on and on) are both examples of what is called a <I>geometric series</I>. They are not at all sums in the usual arithmetic meaning of that word. If the sum stops after a finite number of terms, we call it a <I>finite geometric sum</I>. We can add up the terms of a finite geometric sum using the usual rules of arithmetic.<BR>
<BR>
Replacing 1/2 by <I>r</I>, we can develop a general formula for the sum of a finite geometric sum for any <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image16.gif" WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=8>strictly between 0 and 1 as follows: (Do not be concerned if you don't remember your algebra well enough to work out the details establishing the first equation. We will be working with the second formula below. Look at the second formula and see if you recognize what the symbols mean and how to use it. For example, write out the formula when <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image17.gif" WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=12>and <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image18.gif" WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=13>. You can get a start on this by looking at the bracketed comment following the formula. Notice that the right-hand side of the formula allows you to get the answer while avoiding doing the tedious additions of the fractions on the left-hand side of the equation.)</LI>

<P>[With <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image18.gif" WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=13>, we have <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image21.gif" WIDTH=84 HEIGHT=34>for <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image22.gif" WIDTH=26 HEIGHT=12>, and <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image23.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=34>for <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image24.gif" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=12>. Verify these and then go ahead and try writing out the formula for <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image18.gif" WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=13>and <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image25.gif" WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=12>.]</P>

<LI>Now, we are going to consider what happens as the number of positions once occupied by Achilles gets larger and larger. What happens to the intervening distances covered by him? They get shorter, you say. How much shorter? Are they ever equal to 0?<BR>
<BR>
Mathematicians, writing in mathematical language give meaning to the symbols</LI>
<P><IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image26.gif" WIDTH=58 HEIGHT=32>&#9;as <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image27.gif" WIDTH=9 HEIGHT=9>gets larger and larger. The arrow is read as <I>approaches</I>. What do you think the symbolic statement means, and does it capture your sense of what happens to the distances covered by Achilles? [You can begin thinking about these questions by writing out some examples of <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image28.gif" WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=18>, say, <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image29.gif" WIDTH=126 HEIGHT=18>.]<BR>
</P>
<LI>From the second formula in #7, do you believe the following statement about what happens as <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image30.gif" WIDTH=9 HEIGHT=9>gets larger and larger? And what does it represent in the paradox of Achilles? (In mathematical language, given that <IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image31.gif" WIDTH=35 HEIGHT=14>, we say that the <I>limit</I> of the finite geometric sums equals 2, or that the <I>sum</I> of the geometric series equals 2. Note that the sum of a geometric series is a limit concept.)<BR>
<IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~c2w00/zenoimages/Image32.gif" WIDTH=253 HEIGHT=33><BR>
<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Can you define the meaning of <I>the total distance traveled by Achilles (</I>or<I> by the tortoise)</I> and can you propose a way to calculate it?<BR>
</LI>
<LI>What is the total time traveled by Achilles? by the tortoise? Do these concepts have meaning for you? Describe the situation of the race after 5 seconds have passed. Is the race finished?</LI></OL>
