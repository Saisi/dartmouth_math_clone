<div align="Left">We want to cover as much of chapters 1 through 7 of the
text as we can in 9 1/2 weeks. &nbsp;We'll begin with a study of complex
numbers themselves and their basic properties. &nbsp;This material is covered
in sections 1--8 of the text. &nbsp;Then we'll initiate a study of the calculus
of functions of a single complex variable (sections 9--22), and then investigate
a few of the so-called elementary analytic functions which we're all familar
with from our science courses (sections 23--29).<br>
<br>
In the second part of the course, we'll look at the properties of analytic
functions which are connected to line integrals. &nbsp;We'll try to develop
enough theory to prove that an analyic function (that is, a differentiable
function on an open set of the complex plane) is not only infinitly differentiable,
but is actually given by a convergent power series. &nbsp;To do this, we'll
need to develop some notions in topology and analysis. &nbsp;In particular,
we'll need to review and learn more about power series themselves. &nbsp;This
encompasses Chapters 4 and 5 in the book (sections 30-49). &nbsp;<br>
<br>
After completing the second part of the course, we want to develop some applications
to evaluating improper (real) integrals. &nbsp;This will require the residue
theory of Chapter 6. &nbsp;We'll cover as much of Chapters 6 and 7 as we
can, with some additional topics if time permits.<br>
