<h2>What format should the final be?</h2>
<h2>Please express your opinion!</h2>

<h4>Ok, we have to have a final, but what form should it take. &nbsp;Here
are some possibilities. &nbsp;Perhaps you can think of some others? &nbsp;Anyway,
I'd like to see what you prefer. &nbsp;You can do so by going to the <a href="comments_index.phtml.html">
comments page</a>
 and expressing your opinion. &nbsp;You can also see everyone else's comments
there and comment on the comments. &nbsp;You can write anonymously if you
prefer, and you can respond as often as you like. &nbsp;<i>I would like to
hear at least once from everyone.</i></h4>
<h2>The Choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We could have an <b>in class </b>final. &nbsp;This would be the same
length and format as the first two exams.</li>
  <li>We could have an <b>open book take home</b> final. &nbsp;The final
would be available on the last day of classes (May 29) and due in my office
at the end of our regularly scheduled exam: Saturday, June 1st at 11am.</li>
  <li>We could have a <b>closed book take home</b> final. &nbsp;This would
be available via the web page on Friday and due in my office at 11:00am on
Saturday.</li>
  <li>We could have a <b>combination</b> of take home and in class final.
 &nbsp;The take home portion would be closed book and due at the beginning
of our exam period. &nbsp;The in class portion would be as scheduled. &nbsp;The
take home portion could be either open or closed book.</li>
