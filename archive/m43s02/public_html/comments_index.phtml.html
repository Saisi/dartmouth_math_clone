<TD ALIGN=left>in all seriousness, i took math 24 with beau last term and he's right.  professor williams' take-home portions of his exams are very very difficult...and i don't know about you all but i definitely don't have any kind of attention span, so i can't really sit down for several hours and just take a test.  i have trouble enough with a two-hour exam.  also, there's something incredibly unnerving about sitting in front of a problem for a few days and not knowing what to do with it.  if the same problem is given to me in class, at least i can pretend that i just didn't have enough time to come up with the answer.  time limits are good.  you go in, do what you can, and leave.  an in-class exam would be much more my style.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Yo, if we get a take-home, we can take it home...and if we get an in-class exam, we have to take it in a classroom.  If it's open book, we get to use the book, which is good, cause i don't know anything.  If it's closed book, i don't get to use the book, which is bad, cause i don't know anything...it seems like i want to take an open book take-home, however, i'd just fail that, and it would take longer than the in-class closed book test that i would also fail...you pick!</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>I understand what you are saying Latchezr, but you don't really have to study for an open-book take home.  You don't have to memorize anything (which I hate).  So you might end up saving a bunch of time in the end. </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Look, guys, I have studied enough and done enough homework during the term. I DON'T want to spend all of next week trying to solve some horrific take-home final! Come on, it's summer, after all, though in Hanover that's not particularly obvious. Let's get done with it in two hours and enjoy the sunshine, for heaven's sake!</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>i think that open book take home is optimal. i would not mind slightly harder problems if i have more time to think about them.  we'd also not be bogged down with memorizing definitions and theorems. i too think that a take-home is more true to life. 
a take-home can be just as efficient as an in-class exam, it just depends on how you approach it.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>I would be happy with either an open-book take-home final or an in-class closed-book final.  I have a slight preference for the take-home, because in real life one generally has notes and more time.  </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>yeah, the nice part of in-class is that's it's limited; 2 hours and your done.  but that's also the bad part.  take-homes are tough 'cause they take forever, but you don't have to worry about running out of time (like you would with an in-class). if the take home is too long, you don't sleep.  if the in class is too long, you don't finish.  </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>i'd really like to see an in-class take home final.  i struggled through a couple of prof williams' open book take home exams last term in math 24, and they weren't pretty.  i'd rather study for a few days and saddle up for 2 hours than mull over problems for a few days with the knowledge i can't do them all.</TD>

Its a tough call.  An in-class final is good because we've taken those, so we know what to expect.  An open book take home is nice for obvious reasons, but the questions would probably be harder then.  Just definitely not a closed book take home, that would be the worst of both.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>An in-class exam would be easier.  We've already had two and so we know what to expect.  And at the end of the two hours you've done your best and your turn it in and it's over.  

An open-book take-home exam is never over (until the deadline), because you could always work some more on the parts you didn't entirely finish.  Also, the problems would be much more tricky and subtle.</TD>
