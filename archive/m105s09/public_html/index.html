		<!-- Abstract -->

		<tr>
		  <td> <h3> <a name="abstract">Abstract</a></h3>
		  <td>
			<p style="text-align : justify">This course is an
introduction to elementary analytic number theory.  The primary theme
is the prime number theorem and the role of elementary methods.
</p>
			 
<p>
We shall follow the book of Paul Pollack, ``Not always buried deep",
in particular Chapters 3, 4, 6, and 7.
</p>

<p>
<dl><dt>
1.  Chapter 3, Elementary prime number theory, II<br>
</dt><dd>
Highlights consist of estimates of Chebyshev on counting primes,
including a proof of Bertrand's Postulate:  ``Chebyshev said it,
I'll say it again, there's always a prime between <i>n</i> and
2<i>n</i>.  This chapter also contains the theorem of Mertens,
plus many challenging exercises.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>
2.  Chapter 4, Primes in aritmetic progressions<br>
</dt>
<dd>
This chapter introduces group characters and applies them to
prove the theorem of Dirichlet that for each ``legal" residue
class there are infinitely many primes.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>
3.  Chapter 6, Sieve methods<br>
</dt>
<dd>
This chapter introduces some combinatorial ideas for attacking
some notorious problems such as the twin prime conjecture
and Goldbach's conjecture.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>
4.  Chapter 7, An elementary proof of the prime number theorem <br>
</dt>
<dd>
The title says it all.
</dd>

			 <em> X-hour: </em> Tuesday

<p>
We generally will not use the x-period, but it would be very good for students
to attend the number theory seminar.  This usually meets on Thursdays at
2:30 pm in Room 343 Kemeny, for 1 hour, though there will be a few weeks
when it meets on Tuesdays instead of Thursdays.</p>
<p> There will be no class on Friday, April 17 and no class on Friday,
April 24, nor office hours on the previous Thursdays.

			<p style="text-align : justify"> Collaboration on
homework is definitely allowed and even encouraged.  However,
it is tempting to think that you understand something that was figured out
by your friend.  When you hand in a solution, you should know it well enough
that you could explain it to others.  Please name others you worked with
when handing in homework papers.              Merely copying (electronic or
			otherwise) of another person's solutions, in whole
			or in part, is a violation of the Honor Code.</p>

			<p style="text-align : justify">I encourage any students

			I can to help out, as appropriate.</p>

			<p style="text-align : justify">The Student Disabilities
			Coordinator, Nancy Pompian, can be reached at 6-2014 if
			you have any questions. Any student with a documented
			disability requiring academic adjustments or
			accommodations is requested to speak with me by the end of
			the second week of the term. All discussions will remain
			confidential, although the Academic Skills Center may be
			consulted to verify the documentation of the disability
			and advise on an appropriate response to the need. It is
			important, however, that you talk to me soon, so that I
			can make whatever arrangements might be needed in a timely
			fashion.</p>
