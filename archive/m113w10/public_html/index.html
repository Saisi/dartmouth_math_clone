<h3>Grading and Assignments:</h3>





At heart, I think graduate courses should be taken and offered in the
spirit of scholarship. &nbsp;Therefore grades and grading should
not
play much, if any, role. &nbsp;Nevertheless, learning mathematics
requires "hands on" experience and the Department and Graduate office
require feed back. &nbsp;So there will be periodic homework
assignments
which I will do my best to grade and return in a timely manner.
Problems will range from routine to some that are very difficult.
&nbsp;You are welcome to get help from me or any other source.
&nbsp; <br>





<br>





Please note that at this point, your work should be correct.
&nbsp;Turning in work you don't believe in is inappropriate at this
level. &nbsp;Of course, students do make conceptual mistakes from
time
to time. &nbsp;However, when you turn an assignment in, you are
asserting that you believe that whatever parts of the problem you have
attempted are correct and articulate.

    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Some thoughts on taking an advanced graduate course</span>.
&nbsp;Everyone learns differently, so I don't tell students&nbsp;--
well
graduate students anyway&nbsp;-- how to manage their courses.&nbsp; But
I have
noticed that a few of you don't take notes.&nbsp; I find this
surprising.
I am well aware that most of the time the course follows the book
pretty closely.&nbsp; But I certainly say more than is in the book,
and
often I say it differently or expand on points that Pedersen skips
over.&nbsp; But that is not the point.&nbsp; I find that taking
notes really
forces one to mentally process the material.&nbsp; Also, material
at this
level can't be absorbed in one sitting.&nbsp; When I took courses in
graduate school, I not only took notes, but tried to find the time to
sort though them and actually copy them over filling in the bits that
puzzled me and sometimes even fixing bits that I will charitably say
that I copied down incorrectly.&nbsp; I still have those notes and
have
referred back to some of them during my career.&nbsp; This process
is even
more important in an advanced course like Math 113 where I feel the
emphasis should be on learning as much as you can and NOT just enough
to do the homework.&nbsp; Going though your notes, filling in the
gaps, and
seeing if my "it is easy to see that''s are actually easy to see should
be, in
my opinion, as much a part of learning the material as doing the
homework.</li>
