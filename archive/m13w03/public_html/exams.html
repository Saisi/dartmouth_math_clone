<BLOCKQUOTE> On this page you will find things related to the examinations in Math 13, such as practice problems which we will post at the appropriate time. The two hour-exams and the final are scheduled as follows:</P>

<UL> 
<Li>Hour-Exams (Hour Exam #1 in 101 Bradley; Hour Exam #2 in 101 Bradley)
<UL>
<Li>#1: Wednesday, January 29, 3:30 to 4:45 p.m.</Li>

<ul>
<li><A HREF="m13w02Ex1.pdf">Practice problems for Exam 1</A>: This was the first hour exam for Math 13 in the Winter of 2002. Omit problems 4 and 15 (divergence and curl will be covered on Exam 2 this year).
<ul>
<li>The multiple choice answers are: 1c, 2c, 3d, 4b, 5b, 6b, 7c, 8b, 9b, 10d.

<Li>#2: Wednesday, February 19, 3:30 to 4:45 p.m.</Li>

<ul>
<li><A HREF="m13w02Ex2.pdf">Practice problems for Exam 2</A>: This was the second hour exam for Math 13 in the Winter of 2002. Omit problem 14 and any problems on work; our exam goes only through day18. Also, remember to look at problems 4 and 15 from the first hour exam above of last year; divergence and curl will be covered on our Exam 2 this year.
<ul>
<li>The multiple choice answers were: 1c, 2a, 3c, 4c, 5c, 6d, 7d, 8c (faulty problem; thrown out), 9a, 10c.
</ul>

<li><A HREF="ex2practice.pdf">Practice problems for Exam 2</A>: This was the second hour exam for Math 13 in the Winter of 2001.
<ul>
<li>The multiple choice answers are: 1c, 2d, 3c, 4b, 5a, 6d, 7c, 8d, 9a, 10c.
<li>Number 11: use cylindrical coordinates: integrate z^2 r dz dr dtheta; integrals from left to right have lower and upper limits 0 and 2pi, 0 and 1, 0 and r^2; answer is pi/12.
<li>Number 12: use spherical coordinates: integrate rho^2 sin(phi) drho dphi dtheta; integrals from left to right have lower and upper limits 0 and 2pi, pi/4 and 3pi/4, 0 and 1; answer is 2sqrt(2)pi/3.
<li>Number 13: integrate f(x,y,z) dx dy dz; integrals from left to right have lower and upper limits 0 and 2, 0 and 2, 0 and 1 - y/2.
<li>Number 14: integrate t^2+10*t-(5-t)^2+25 from t=0 to t=5; answer is 250.
<li>Number 15: (a) Line integral is the integral from -1 to 1 of 2*(1+2*t)^2; answer is 28/3.
<li>Number 15: (b) Line integral is the integral from -pi to 0 of -sin(t)*cos(t)^2+cos(t); answer is 2/3.
<li>Number 15: (c) Since the line integrals over the two paths c1 and c2 are the same (both equal 2/3), then we cannot draw any conclusion. But note that F is not a gradient field because if F = grad f for some f, then the second mixed partials of f are not equal: fsubxy = 0, and fsubyx = -y.

<Li>Final Exam
<UL>
<Li>The time of the final has been scheduled by the Registrar for Wednesday, March 12, 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., in 28 Silsby. Do not make any plans that would interfere with your taking the final at the scheduled time.</Li>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="m13w02fin.pdf">Practice problems for the Final</A>: This was the final exam for Math 13 in the Winter of 2002. Our final this term will consist of 20 multiple choice questions. The final covers all of the material we have studied in the course, but about one-fourth will be on topics since the last exam.
<ul>
<li>The answers to the practice problems are: 1b, 2d, 3b, 4d, 5a, 6c, 7a, 8d, 9d, 10a, 11c, 12c, 13c, 14d, 15a, 16a, 17c, 18b, 19b, 20d.
