That is, all of the required work is the same, as is the material that is covered. The grades are assigned as if all students were attending the same class. So, you should feel free to talk to either Dan Cole or Dwight Lahr, even though you probably should seek out your own instructor first, primarily because they want to get to know as many as possible of the students they see in class.</P><P><B>Textbook:</B> <I>Basic Multivariable Calculus</I> by Marsden, Tromba, Weinstein.<P><B>Instructors:</B><BR>Section 1: MWF 11:15-12:20 (x-hour Tu 12:00-12:50) in 105 Bradley<BR>Daniel Cole<BR>1-G Bradley, 646-2565<BR>Office Hours: MWF 2:00-3:00 (and by appt.)<BR><BR>Section 2: MWF 12:30-1:35 (x-hour Tu 1:00-1:50) in 105 Bradley<BR>Dwight Lahr<BR> 410 Bradley, 646-2672<BR>Office hours: 	MW: 2:00-3:00 (and by appt.)<BR><BR><B>Graduate Student Course Assistant:</B><BR>Lizz Moseman, 1-I Bradley<BR><BR><B>Graders, Tutors:</B> To be identified later.<BR><P><B>Class Meetings:</B> Class meetings consist of three 65-minute lectures. The lectures introduce new material and provide the course structure. <P><B>Examinations:</B> There will be two hour-exams and a (two-hour) final examination that is scheduled by the Registrar. The two hour-exams and the final exam are scheduled as follows:<BR><CENTER>Hour-Exam 1: Wednesday, January 29, 3:30–4:45 p.m., 101 Bradley<BR>Hour-Exam 2: Wednesday, February 19, 3:30–4:45 p.m., 101 Bradley<BR>Final Exam: Wednesday, March 12, 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., 28 Silsby.</CENTER>Each of the two hour-exams will consist of two parts-- a multiple-choice part and a non multiple-choice part where partial credit can be earned. The final exam will be multiple-choice. No calculators or computers will be needed or allowed in the sit-down exams. But you will be able to use one 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of notes in the exams.<P>	<B>Homework Problem Sets:</B> Homework will be assigned at class meetings and will be due by the next class meting. This is the suggested or soft due-date. The hard due-date will be roughly two days later, will always be on a class day at 11:00 a.m., and will be posted on the WeBWorK assignment. WeBWorK is the computer software that you will use to get and turn in your homework over the World Wide Web. (We will say more about WeBWorK below.) It will be up to you to keep up with the due-dates posted on the problem sets.<P>Late homework counts zero without an excuse approved by your instructor, obtained well before the hard due-date of the assignment. Only requests such as documented medical emergencies will be approved.<P> A perfect homework record will earn you 50 points toward the determination of your course grade. You will have until 11:00 a.m. on the posted hard due-date to get the homework right; answers will be available at 1:00 p.m. on the same day.<P>Submitting the homework has two main purposes: first, to give you, the student, feedback on how well you are understanding and mastering the material; and second, to provide us, the instructors, with a report on your daily and weekly progress and work habits.<P><B>WeBWorK:</B> You will be using the computer program WeBWorK to get the homework problems and submit your answers. WeBWorK will also keep track of the points you earn. See the <A HREF="webworkintro.html">WeBWorK intro page</A> for an introduction to the system.<P><B>Grades:</B> The course grade will be based upon the scores of the two hour-exams, the final examination, and the homework, as follows:<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>Hour-Exams: 200 points (100 points each)<BR>Final Exam: 150 points (multiple-choice)<BR>Homework: 50 points <BR></BLOCKQUOTE>The total of 400 points will be the basis for final grades in the course.<P><B>Tutorials:</B> Assistance on the daily homework can be obtained in tutorials staffed by the TA and undergraduate student tutors. These are scheduled in Room 104 Bradley Hall from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m. on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings.<P><B>Academic Honor Principle:</B> <BR>On sit-down exams: No help is to be given or received. <BR>On homework problem sets: Each person in the class has the potential to receive a homework assignment distinct from anyone else's, but all are cut from the same mold. For example, suppose we wanted to ask people to find the derivative of a*x^m. Each student would receive their own value of a and m, so the problems are cosmetically different, while being identical in the concept they are testing. We encourage you to get any assistance that helps you learn to solve these problems, even by (in fact, especially by) collaborating with other students. But work through each problem on your own to get the answer that you enter into the computer. It is a violation of the honor code for someone to provide the answers for you.<P><B>Disabilities:</B> Any student with a documented disability needing academic adjustments or accommodations is requested to speak to your instructor by the end of the second week of the term. All discussions will remain confidential, although the Student Disabilities Coordinator may be consulted to verify the documentation of the disability. The Student Disabilities Coordinator is Nancy Pompian, at extension 6-2014, in the Academic Skills Center. In addition to providing information and services, the Center is in charge of registering disabilities and approving accommodations.<P><B>Math 13 Website:</B> We have set up a website to organize the materials of the course. The address is http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m13w03/. We will place there all materials related to the course, including the homework assignments.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p><p><SMALL> Copyright &copy; 2002 by C.
