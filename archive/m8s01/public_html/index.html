<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Schedule:</H2>
<P>We will meet in the 11 period (a.k.a. Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 11:15 to 12:20). <I>Note that we will also meet in our x-period (12:00 Tuesday) as needed.</I> Note that the departmental syllabus above requires 29 class periods, so we will need to use at least two x-periods during the term. The daily schedule below will show the days on which we have class, the homework due that day, and the x-periods we plan to use. Note that this schedule will change on an almost daily basis, and the changes will likely include the x-periods we plan to use. The class will be held in Room 102 Bradley Hall. </P>

<LI>Our second "mid-term" exam will be on Wednesday May 9 in Room 111 Wilder. Plan to come for any two-hour period between 3PM and 6PM. </LI>
<LI>Our final exam has been scheduled by the registrar for Friday June 1 from 9:00AM-11:00AM. The exam will be designed as a two hour exam. However we will be available in the exam room (which has not yet been scheduled) at 8:00 AM for anyone who would like to have 3 hours to work on the exam. </LI>
<LI>Solutions to Exam 1 have been posted. </LI>
<LI>There are some new practice problems under the exams link. Because of prior commitments, we will be unable to provide solutions. </LI>
<LI>There is a practice exam posted under the exams link. Keep your eye on that link, because we will soon post solutions to the practice exam. We suggest you not look at the solutions until you have tried the practice exam. It is based on an exam actually given in Math 8 in the winter, but is a bit longer. That practice exam will take longer than the real exam we give you will take. </LI>
<LI>There is a goood table of trig identities on the inside front cover of our textbook. Those should be all you need. </LI>
<LI>The supplementary notes for April 11 are now available </LI>
<LI>The short version of the notes for April 6 is now available </LI>
<LI>The notes for April 4 are now available. Click on the Supplementary Notes link below to get them. You will need Adobe Acrobat Reader, available from the Public file server to read and print them. </LI>
<LI>The first exam will be held in Room 111 Wilder on Wednesday April 18. Come for any two hours between 3PM and 6PM. </LI>
<LI>If you are having trouble finding the homework assignments, check out the link called "Daily Schedule." </LI>
<LI>Homework problems which are of the "short answer" type where you cannot show a significant amount of work (e.g. is the following differential equation separable) will be graded on the basis of one point. In multipart problems, points will be assigned at the discretion of the instructors. </LI>
<LI>The homework tutorials will be Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings from 7:00-9:30 in Room 102 Bradley. </LI>
<LI>You may use Maple to check your homework and to do routine graphing problems that you already know how to do. However since Maple will not be available for exams, you should be able to do the problems we assign "by hand," because similar problems may be on the exams. </LI>
<LI>We will post general announcements here. The most recent announcements will appear first, so this announcement will appear last! </LI></UL>

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><H2>The Honor Principle</FONT>:</H2>
<B><P>On exams</B>: No help given or received. <FONT COLOR="#008000">No calculators will allowed on exams.</FONT> </P>
<B><P>On homework</B>: Collaboration and the use of computers are permitted and encouraged, but NO COPYING . In other words, you should feel free to use your computer and to talk to other students, your instructors, or the tutor while you are in the process of thinking about a problem. However, when it comes time to write up your solutions, you should do this by yourself without outside assistance. </P>
<H2>Special Needs:</H2>
<P>Students with special needs or disabilities should contact one of your instructors as soon as possible (At least by April 6) so that we can arrange appropriate accommodations. <!--
