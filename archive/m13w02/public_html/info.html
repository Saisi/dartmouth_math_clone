That is, all of the required work is the same, as is the material that is covered. The grades are assigned as if all students were attending the same class. So, you should feel free to talk to either Professor Doherty or Lahr, even though you probably should seek out your own instructor first, primarily because they want to get to know as many as possible of the students they see in class.</P><P><B>Textbook:</B> <I>Basic Multivariable Calculus</I> by Marsden, Tromba, Weinstein.<P><B>Instructors:</B><BR>Section 1: MWF 11:15-12:20 in Bradley 101 (x-hour Tu 12:00-12:50)<BR>Dwight Lahr<BR> 410 Bradley, 646-2672<BR>Office hours: 	MTuW: 1:00-2:00 (and by appt.)<BR><BR>Section 2: MWF 12:30-1:35 in Bradley 105 (x-hour Tu 1:00-1:50)<BR>Faun Doherty<BR>402 Bradley, 646-1614<BR>Office Hours: M 3:00-4:00, W 1:35-2:30, Fri 1:45-2:45 (and by appt.)<BR><BR><B>Graduate Student Course Assistant:</B><BR>Oscar Campos, 1-J Bradley<BR><BR><B>Graders, Tutors:</B> To be identified later.<BR><P><B>Class Meetings:</B> Class meetings consist of three 65-minute lectures. The lectures introduce new material and provide the course structure. <P><B>Examinations:</B> There will be two hour-exams and a (two-hour) final examination. The final exam is scheduled by the Registrar. The two hour-exams are scheduled as follows:<BR><CENTER>Hour-Exam 1: Wednesday, January 30, 3:30–4:45 p.m.<BR>Hour-Exam 2: Wednesday, February 20, 3:30–4:45 p.m.<BR>Location: 101 Bradley</CENTER>Each of the two hour-exams will consist of two parts-a multiple-choice part and a non multiple-choice part where partial credit can be earned. The final exam will be multiple-choice. No calculators or computers will be needed or allowed in the sit-down exams. But you will be able to use one 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of notes in the exams.<P>	<B>Homework Problem Sets:</B> Homework will be assigned at class meetings and will be due by 11:00 a.m. on the day of the next class meting. This is the suggested or soft due-date. The hard due-date will be roughly two days later, will always be on a class day at 11:00 a.m., and will be posted on the assignment. Because of scheduling, more than one assignment may be due on the same day. It will be up to you to keep up with the due-dates.<P>You will get and turn in your homework over the web using WeBWorK (we will say more about that below). Late homework counts zero without an excuse from your instructor, obtained well before the hard due-date of the assignment. Only requests such as documented medical emergencies will be approved.<P><B>WeBWorK:</B> You will be using the computer program WeBWorK to get the homework problems and submit your answers. WeBWorK will also keep track of the points you earn. See the web page http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m13w02/webworkintro.html for an introduction to the system.Submitting the homework has two main purposes: first, to give you, the student, feedback on how well you are understanding and mastering the material; and second, to provide us, the instructors, with a report on your daily and weekly progress and work habits.<P> A perfect homework record will earn you 50 points toward the determination of your course grade. You will have until 11:00 a.m. on the posted hard due-date to get the homework right; answers will be available at 1:00 p.m. on the same day.<P><B>Grades:</B> The course grade will be based upon the scores of the two hour-exams, the final examination, and the homework, as follows:<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>Hour-Exams: 200 points (100 points each)<BR>Final Exam: 150 points (multiple-choice)<BR>Homework: 50 points <BR></BLOCKQUOTE>The total of 400 points will be the basis for final grades in the course.<P><B>Tutorials:</B> Assistance on the daily homework can be obtained in tutorials staffed by the TA and undergraduate student tutors. These are scheduled in Room 104 Bradley Hall from 7:00 to 9:00 pm on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings.<P><B>Academic Honor Principle:</B> <BR>On sit-down exams: No help is to be given or received. <BR>On homework problem sets: Each person in the class has the potential to receive a homework assignment distinct from anyone else's, but all are cut from the same mold. For example, suppose we wanted to ask people to find the derivative of a*x^m. Each student would receive their own value of a and m, so the problems are cosmetically different, while being identical in the concept they are testing. We encourage you to get any assistance that helps you learn to solve these problems, even by (in fact, especially by) collaborating with other students. But work through each problem on your own to get the answer that you enter into the computer. It is a violation of the honor code for someone to provide the answers for you.<P><B>Disabilities:</B> We encourage students with documented disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities such as chronic diseases, learning disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities, to discuss possible accommodations with one of your instructors. Students might want to consult as well the Student Disabilities Coordinator, Nancy Pompian, at extension 6-2014, in the Academic Skills Center. In addition to providing information and services, the Center is in charge ofregistering disabilities and approving accommodations.<P><B>Math 13 Website:</B> We have set up a website to organize the materials of the course. The address is http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m13w02/. We will place there all the handouts of the course, as well as the homework assignments.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p><p><SMALL> Copyright &copy; 2002 by C.
