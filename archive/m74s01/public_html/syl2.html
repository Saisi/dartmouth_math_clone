Syllabus</H1>
</CENTER>



<p>
Step 1: We begin this course with a  review  of
fundamental groups (see
also <a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/#ATI">section 1.1 </a>)
and the
Deck theorem; along with a
carefully presented motivational <a href="w1/need.pdf"> example </a>.
(See the  <a href="../../m54w01/public_html/syl.html">
Math 54 
</a> syllabus for an account of  the ideas from basic topology that you
will need.)  In
this example we will
articulate what we will mean by giving a space a geometric structure in
the context of Euclidean geometry. Hopefully we will finish this course on
the same note but using a many holed torus  and hyperbolic geometry!

<p>
Step 2: The groups of interest.  We will get a feel for the groups that
form "deck-like" group actions.  In particular we will learn about
free products and how to view a  group in terms of its
presentation. Topologically our primary tool to accomplish this
understanding will be  Van Kampen's theorem (see
<a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/#ATI">section 1.2 </a>).  In
the process we will  <a href="w2/zip.pdf"> classify </a> all compact 
connected surfaces, and learn how to construct a topological space with a
specified fundamental group via the Cayley complex.  


<p>
Step 3: Covering Space Theory. Including: general liftings, the Deck
theorem's converse, and the <a
href="w2/group.pdf"> Galois
correspondence</a> (see also 
<a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/#ATI">section 1.3 </a>).
We will emphasize  carefully constructing covers 
of the punctured torus and a genus two surface.
This material will  finish
the topological half of the course, here is
the first <a
href="w2/exam.pdf"> exam </a>.

<p>
Step 4: Our next goal will be to develop the language  with
which we shall articulate  hyperbolic
geometry.  The approach  taken here will be to  use the language  of the
complex plane.  Namely we will examine <a
href="w2/con.pdf"> conformal </a> structures and mappings, and then we
tackle the problem of explicitly understanding the
properties of the continuous  group 
of conformal mapping of the Riemann Sphere: the  <a
href="w2/con1.pdf"> Mobius group.</a>
In the process we shall explore carefully its subgroups consisting of maps
preserving the unit disk and the upper-half plane.

<p>
Step 5.
Now we develop the most important geometry for topologist; hyperbolic
geometry.  We will take Reimann's point of view and develop the Poincare
disk and upper half plane models via the use of a Riemannian metric. 
We will explore carefully the primary objects: geodesics, circles,
triangles (finite and beyond), horocirlces, bananas, and divine
lengths; as well as understand the congruences: finite rotations,
rotations about infinity, translations, glide reflections , and
reflections.  
Here are some example
<a href="w2/prob.pdf"> problems  </a>. 

<p>
Step 6: In this final step, we  <a href="w2/last.pdf">  discuss </a> 
the Killing-Hopf Theorem which assures us  that
each compact surface admits a geometric structure,
and then we articulate  the notion of this geometry's <a href="w2/fx.pdf">
 uniqueness  </a>.  In particular  we put together the geometry and
topology we have learned in order to whiteness geometric structures on all
compact connected surfaces and the tessellations of the hyperbolic
space associated to most of them.
