<h2>Math 54  Log</h2>
<hr>
<b> Week 1:</b>
<p>

For a few days we will <a href="w1/need.pdf">Review</a>.
For Friday do problem 8 (<a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/m74/p18.gif">Problem 8 a </a>  and  <a

from the
handout.


<p>

<b> Week 2:</b>
<p>
The groups that arise this quarter come in to flavors "discrete" and
"topological".  This week we will explore the nature of the discrete
groups that will arise, via Van Kampen's theorem.  
Section 1.2 of chapter 1 in Hatcher's
<a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/#ATI">book.</a>

13 </a> and  <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/m74/p13b.gif">continue </a>).
<p>

<p>
Tuesday:
We will be meeting tomorrow at our X-session time this week (as
well as
next
Tuesday).  (I will be gone Wednesday April
11th and Friday 13th and need to make these classes.)


<p>
Due on  Tuesday: <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/m74/p12a.gif">Problem
12  </a> (and  <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/m74/p12b.gif">continue </a>) from the initial
<a href="w1/need.pdf"> review </a>, and read
pages 39-45 of section 1.2 in <a
href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/#ATI">Hatcher</a>. 

<p> 


<p>
Due on  Friday:  problem <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/m74/q2a.gif">Problem
2 </a> (and  <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/m74/q2b.gif">continue </a> and <a

<p>

<p>

<p>

<b> Week 3:</b>
<p>

<p>
Due on Monday:  Be  ready to present 
<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/m74/m2a.gif">Problem
4 </a> (and  <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/m74/m2b.gif">continue </a> as well as  <a

the <a href="w2/zip.pdf"> classification </a> handout.
<p>


<p>
Tuesday: We will once again be meeting  at our X-session time this week,
since <b> I will be gone Friday the 13th </b> and on  Wednesday the
11th there will be
an enrichment  guest lecture on the fundamental groups of Knot
Complements,
by Professor Peter Doyle.  Every one should pay close attention during
this lecture since Knot complements are the next natural class of
topological spaces where one would explore the
"geometrization program" explored in the surface case in this course.

<p>

Due on Tuesday:  Use Van Kampen's theorem to justify that the
fundamental groups listed in the table on page 57 of Hatcher's book    
are indeed accurate.


</b>

<p>

<b> Week 4:</b>
<p>

<p>
Due on Monday: Be prepared to present the problems that where due last
Tuesday.

<p>
Tuesday: Algebra madness!  We will explore some of the group theory
we
are playing with.  This will be very basic and optional.   In particular
we will
construct several views of the symmetric group and show it can be
represented as the fundamental group of a topological space as well.
<p>


<p>
Due on  Wednesday:  
From the <a
href="w2/group.pdf"> Galois
correspondence</a>  problem 13 (here are parts 
<a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/m74/s5.gif"> 5 </a>   and  <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/m74/j2.gif">
2 
</a>).    

<p>

Due on Friday:  
From the <a
href="w2/group.pdf"> Galois
correspondence</a> do problem 
14. 


<p>
<b> Week 5:</b>
<p>

<p>

Due on Monday:  
From the <a
href="w2/group.pdf"> Galois
correspondence </a> finish  problem <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/m74/sb1.gif"> 14 </a> (<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/m74/sb2.gif"> continue  </a> and <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/m74/sb3.gif"> continue  </a>).

<p>
Tuesday: We will meet and  discuss the assignment that was due on Monday.
<p>


<p>
Due on Wednesday:  Explicitly describe the Deck transformations of the
universal cover from Monday's assignment, attempt to find an order two
subgroup of the Deck group and USE it to form a cover with fundamental
group Z mod 2Z.  From our discussion on Tuesday: attempt to decide which
basepoint corresponds to which of the three order two subgroups. 

<p>
Due on  Friday: read and think carefully about pages 59-72 of <a
href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/#ATI">Hatcher</a>.


<p>
<b> Week 6:</b>
<p>

<p>

Due on Monday:  
The necessity of local conditions - do problems <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/m74/s7.gif">  7 </a> and 6
from from <a
href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/#ATI">Hatcher</a>, 
and using
the space in number 7 show that the Galois
correspondence fails if the space is not locally path connected.  

<p>
Due on Tuesday: Complete Monday's homework!
<p>
Wednesday:  Here is the <a
href="w2/exam.pdf"> exam </a> it is due Tuesday's sometime before 2 in the
afternoon.
The spaces (X,x) and (Y,y) are described  <a

Here is the <a
href="w2/con.pdf"> conformal </a> geometry.

<p>
Friday: Read the entire <a
href="w2/con.pdf"> conformal </a> handout and skim Kr and Ka.  The four
exercises from the <a
href="w2/con.pdf"> conformal </a> 
handout will be presented (<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/jx1.gif"> exercise 1</a>,
<a

<p>
<b> Week 8:</b>
<p>
Monday: Read the  <a
href="w2/con1.pdf"> Mobius  </a> handout and skim Kr and Ka.  Do the
exercise 3 from the <a

<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/sx.gif"> exercise </a>,
<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/mx7.gif"> exercise 7 </a>, and 
<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/mx7b.gif"> part2 </a>.
<p>

Tuesday:  We will go over the exam. Here are some nice solutions. 
John managed to do <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/m74/x3.gif"> Q16 </a>!  Here is the <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/xjj1a.gif"> first  </a> part.  You can print out the next
three images and put them to gether to geometrically see the Galois
correspondence: <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/xj1b.gif"> left  </a>,
<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/xj1c.gif"> center </a>,
<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/xjd.gif"> right  </a>.
Here is the most dramatic of all the solutions - Sam's beautiful solution
to the
extremely challenging number 2c: 
the  <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/x2c.gif">  first  </a> part, the  
<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/x2cb.gif"> second  </a> part, and the <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/x2cc.gif"> third  </a> part.

Here is Jason's solution to 2d (<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/x2da.gif">  first  </a> part, the
<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/x2db.gif"> second  </a> part), where you can cut out
and glue up the
solution for your self!
Here is Karthik's solution to the first one for D8 <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/x1a.gif">  first  </a> part, the
<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/x1b.gif"> second  </a> part, and the <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/x1c.gif"> third  </a> part.

For those of you who used algebraic techniques to solve  2e and 2f here
are
John's <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/x2e.gif"> 2e  </a>
 and
Mihai's  <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/x2f.gif"> 2f  </a> demonstrating as particularly elegant
geometric solutions. 



<p>

Wednesday: Do exercise 5 from the <a
href="w2/con1.pdf"> Mobius  </a> handout. (Note this handout as been

page 42 of Kr) prove that $d_{\rho}(x,y)$ is indeed a
metric.  Skim through the rest of Kr and Ka. 
(<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/mx7.gif"> exercise 7 </a> and <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/mx7b.gif"> this </a>.) 

<p>
<b> Week 9
</b>
<p>
Monday: Do exercises 1 and 2 from the <a
href="w2/prob.pdf"> Problems  </a>.
(<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/jh1.gif"> exercise </a> and 
<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/xpicts/jh2.gif"> this </a>).



<p>

Tuesday: Homework Presentation day.  Please do problems 3 and 4 from the
<a href="w2/prob.pdf"> Problems  </a>  for today and be  ready to
present last Wednesday's, Friday's, and this Monday's problems.
<p>
Wednesday:  Please do problems 5,6 and 7  from the
<a href="w2/prob.pdf"> Problems  </a>  for today (and be ready to present 
problems 3 and 4.) Finish reading the KR and KA parts of the handout.
<p>

<p>Friday: Please do problem 9  from the
<a href="w2/prob.pdf"> Problems  </a>.  Here is the <a href="w2/fx.pdf"> 
final exam </a>, due on or before 4 P.M. on June 5th.  Please put it
in my box or
under my
door, and {\bf e-mail me} after you have done this.

<p>
<b> Week 10:</b>
<p>
Tuesday:  An optional day where we discuss the proof of the Hopf-Rinow
theorem.

<p>
Wednesday:  We <a href="w2/last.pdf">
conclude  </a> the course, here is <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/w2/pic1.jpeg"> picture 1</a> and <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m74s01/w2/pic2.jpeg"> picture 2 </a>.  For  a very nice 
 proof   of the Hopf Rinow theorem (a little different than the one
discussed in class) see Page
36 of the nice book:
<p>
John Stillwell, <b> The Geometry of Surfaces </b>, Springer-Verlag, 1992 
(Math QA 645 .S75 1992). 

<p>
 This book is a nice place to explore
 alternate view points to what occurred in the second half of this
course, as well as find a nice introduction to the generalization of these
ideas to more general tesselations and  their orbit spaces (orbifolds). 
 

<p>

<b>Exam Extension: The <a href="w2/fx.pdf">
final exam </a>  is due by 4 P.M. on June 5th
</b>
<p>
Exam corrections:  
<p>
1.  Section 2 problem 3 was false as stated!  Please see the corrected
exam. (P.S. Thanks Sam!).  (Changed on exam Sunday night).
<p>

2.  By the  gluing together of ideal triangles in  part 3 I mean the
identification space formed via a  mapping sending one edge of a given 
ideal triangle to an  edge of a second ideal triangle via an isometry,
i.e. an isometry from the first  <b> edge </b> to the second, which
simply amounts to
an isometry of one geodesic onto another.  (changed on exam Sunday night).


<p> 

3. Typos in part 1 numbers 2 and 3.  Note number 3(c) has been
re-phrased. (Also
changed on Sunday evening).
