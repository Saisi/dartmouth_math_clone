<p>
<b>Grade</b>: Your grade will be determined as follows: homework and
presentations will be 40% of your grade, and
two exams will constitute 30% each.

<p>
<b>Homework</b>:  Homework
will be posted each day  and
due by the following day.   The assignments can be found in
the
<a href="hw.html"> Log.</a>    You will be given 
1 or 2 (often quite involved) problems per lecture which you will be
expected to do completely.  One of the goals of this class is to learn to
articulate and write up your
solutions carefully and this will be enforced by the daily presentation,
where a student will be chosen at random to present a solution of the
previous classes assigned problem.   At this point we will discuss the
result
together and by the next day you will be expected to turn in an accurate
version of the solution  which will be posted on the web site.


<p>
<b>Exams</b>:
 Both the exams will be take home. You will
receive the first exam on Friday April the 27th  and it will be due at
class time on Wednesday May the 2nd at the beginning of class.
<p>

<b>Honor policy</b>:
Collaboration is encouraged during the process of
thinking about and writing up homework problems.
No collaboration of any form is acceptable during exams, and (expect when
explicitly stated on the exam) the use of any references other than your
class notes and our official references  is not acceptable.
<p>
<b>Students with disabilities</b>:  I encourage students with
disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases
and learning disabilities, to discuss  with me any
appropriate accommodations that might be helpful.
