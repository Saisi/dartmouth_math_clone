<b> Syllabus</b>:

We will  explore various aspects of the geometry of  
surfaces and curves.   This will include developing languages to 
describe the geometry of a  surface both from the point of view of an 
astronomer  watching the surface as it sits in space,  and from 
the point of view of a  bug living on the surface.
We will emphasize the use of vector calculus tools in  developing this 
language, hence the use of the term "differential" in this course's title. 
(A solid vector calculus background, the equivalent of Math 13,14, or 15, 
is required.) We will end the course 
by exploring one of the great theorems of  mathematics: the Gauss-Bonnet 
theorem.  The Gauss-Bonnet theorem will allow 
us to  determine  certain global (topological) properties of the surface 
from the surface's local geometry.
