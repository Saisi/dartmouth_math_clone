<blockquote>

You are encouraged to try as many of the exercises as possible from each
of the sections covered in class, and I will be happy to discuss any of
the exercises beyond those included on this list.  Try and do at least
one problem from each subsection of the exercise set from each section. 
Please write up these assigned exercises and turn them in during the
class period following the day that they're assigned.  In writing them
up, please explain your methods in solving the problems.  Just giving the
answers won't gain you much credit.  

<p>

Additionally, come to class each day prepared to go over the True-False questions that begin each section's homework.  We will spend the first 5-10 minutes of class going over this set of questions orally.
