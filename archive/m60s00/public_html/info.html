<b>Text</b>: <I>
<a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/">Introduction
to Probability</I></a>, (second Edition), by
Grinstead and Snell
<p>



<p>
<b>Syllabus</b>: Announcements as well as each week's material
will presented  in that week's <a href="dlog.html">Weekly Log</a>.
We will be covering nearly all of  chapters 1-9 and 11 of  <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/">our
book</a> (scroll down to see the table of contents). This will include
"continuous distributions" a topic not
discussed in
math 20.   Notice at this pace we will be covering more than a chapter
a week of this book; and hence a  good deal of the required material
will not be presented in lecture and you will be required to understand it
directly from the book.  You will want to look at  the book yourself and
make sure you feel you can do this, or wait and take  the more leisurely
paced  math 20. 
<p>

<b>Grade</b>: Your grade will be determined as follows:
<PRE>
Category         Weight
----------------------------------
homework         30%
exam 1           20%
exam 2           20%
final            30% 
</PRE>
<p>
<b>Homework</b> 
Homework for each day will be  posted in the weekly log, and the part
that
is to be collected will be due  at the beginning of
the  lecture following the lecture in which it was assigned. Your two
lowest homework grades will be dropped and no late homework will be
accepted. Be warned that only a select few of the turned
in problems will actually be graded, so please write them all up nicely. 
The assignments can be found
in each week’s
<a href="dlog.html">Weekly Log</a>
<p>
<b>Exams</b>
 All the exams will be take home.  You will receive the first  exam on 
Wednesday April 19  and it will be due at class time on Friday April
21.  The second exam will be handed out Wednesday May 10 and due Friday
May 12 at the beginning of class.  The final will be handed out on
Wednesday May 31 and due by
Monday June 5 at noon (under my office door.)  <p> <b>Makeup policy</b>:
Makeup exams and extentions  will only be given in case of
legitimate emergencies.
<p>
<b>Honor policy</b>:
Collaboration is encouraged during the process of
thinking about homework problems, but is not acceptable while writing
up your final solutions.
No collaboration of any form is acceptable during exams, and (expect when
explicitly stated on the exam) the use of any references other than
your class notes and our book  is not acceptable.
<p>


<b>Students with disabilities</b>:  I encourage students with
disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases
and learning disabilities, to discuss me any
appropriate accommodations that might be helpful.

<p>

<b>Maple</b>:  We will be using the software package <i>Maple</i> from
time to time.  If you are not familiar with Maple, <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/software">here is some
