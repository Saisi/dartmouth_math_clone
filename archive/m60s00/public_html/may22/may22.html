<P>
<B>Wednesday</B>

<P>
Read 12.1 and 3.3.  From 10.1 do numbers 3 and 4; from 12.1 do

<P>
<B>Homework</B>

<P>
Read 3.3 again and read carefully the New-Age solitare game described on
page 129. 

<P>
<B>Problem  1:</B>  Obtain and order a  deck of cards as if it were a
new
deck (as described
on page
129),  play the new age solitare 10 times, and record whether yin or yang
suits win each time.  

<P>
<B>Problem 2:</B>
 show up for Tuesday's x-hour.

<P>
<B>Extra Credit</B>

<P>
Notice this week's assignment is the last assignment of the quarter  and
is
particularly easy.  Please use this
opportunity  to catch up on any assignments which you have
missed;  you will receive partial credit on any such
efforts.  Once you have made an effort on <B>all</B> the assignments 
you may redo any  problems from any time during the quarter which you
missed and receive extra credit for your efforts.  (This is intended as an
opportunity to review old material in a constructive way.)

<P>
If instead you would like to try some new (and fun!) problems and receive
extra credit then
do  as many of 8-15 in section 12.1 as you can.

<P>
<B>Next Wednesday is the last time to turn anything in
for credit, including the above extra credit opportunities and late
assignments.</B>  Next Wednesday you will receive your take home final
which will be due by 10 o'clock in the morning Tuesday June 6 (under my
office door).
