Homework due Friday, November 12.<br>
Section 1.4, number 12.<br>
Section 5.2, numbers 6, 8, 9, 11, 13.
(Concerning number 11, we derived a related formula in class.)<br>
Section 5.3, numbers 2, 3, 6, 8.<br>
Extra problem: 
Say there is a breath test for the dread dease mathphobia.  It is thought
that this rare affliction has probability of occurrence in the population
of 1/1000.  The breath test will definitely test positive if you are
a mathphobic, but if you do not have this disease, the test gives a
false positive 1% of the time.  What is the probability you have
mathphobia if you test positive?
</p>

<p> Homework due Friday, Nov. 5:<br>
<b>Section 4.5, numbers 1, 2, 9.</b>  You may use what we called the "Master Inequality" (that is, you need not use induction):<br>
If T(n) &le; aT(n/b)+f(n) and S(n) is a solution to the recurrence
S(n)=aS(n/b)+f(n), S(1)=T(1), then T(n) &le; S(n).<br>
<b>Section 4.6, numbers 4, 5, 6, 8.</b><br>
For extra credit, prove the following:  If a,b>0 with a+b=c<1, and if T(n) &le; T(an)+T(bn)+n,
then T(n) &le; S(n), where S(n) is a solution to the recurrence S(n)=S(cn)+n,
S(1)=T(1).  <br>
Note that the above problem has been changed and is now only extra credit.
(On some systems, an ampersand followed by "le" displays as its typed,
instead of displaying as the less than or equal to sign.)<br>

			<p style="text-align : justify"> Students are encouraged

			important is a student's eventual understanding of
			homework problems, and not how that is achieved. The honor
			principle applies to homework in the following way. <span
			style="color:#CC0000; font-weight:bold">What a student
			turns in as a homework solution is to be his or her own
			understanding of how to do the problem. Students must
			state what sources they have consulted, with whom they
			have collaborated, and from whom they have received
			help.</span> Students are discouraged from using solutions
			to problems that may be posted on the web for previous
			offerings of the course, and as just stated, must
			reference them if they use them. The solutions you submit
			must be written by you alone.  Any copying (electronic or
			otherwise) of anotehr person's code or solutions, in whole
			or in part, is a violation of the Honor Code.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align : justify">The honor principle
			applies to exams as follows:<span style="color: #CC0000">
			<b> Students may not give or receive assistance of any
			kind on an exam from any person except for the professor
			or someone explicitly designated by the professor to
			answer questions about the exam. Students may not use

			but they may use their textbook and personal
			notes.</b></span></p>
			
			<p style="text-align : justify">If you have any questions as to whether some action
			would be acceptable under the Academic Honor Code, please
			speak to me or another member of the course staff, and we

			to ask beforehand than to have trouble later!</p>
