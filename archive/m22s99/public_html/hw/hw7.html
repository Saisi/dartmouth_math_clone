Reminder: The in class portion of our second exam is this
Wednesday, May 12th. Don't be late! The take home portion of the
exam will be handed out then and will be due on Thursday, May 13th,
at the beginning of class. Because the in class portion of
the exam is on a Wednesday, this Thursday's lecture will be a
normal lecture, i.e. we'll be doing Section 5.4.
</H2>

<BR>
<H2>
There will be a review session on Monday, May 10th, from
7:00 to 9:00 pm, in 104 Bradley (i.e. where our class is).

The second hour exam will emphasize material covered since the
first hour exam, through Section 5.2. (The first hour exam covered
material through Section 3.2 .) In addition to understanding and
being able to solve <B>all</B> the homework problems assigned
since then, some additional practice problems (mostly True/False)
would include
<UL>
<LI> Section 4.1, page 217: 7, 21
<LI> Section 4.2, page 227: 24, 25, 26, 29, 35

<LI> Section 5.1, page 302: 21, 22
<LI> Section 5.2, page 311: 21, 22
</UL>
Regarding knowing the statements of theorems: if the book gives it
a name (e.g. The Spanning Set Theorem), you should know it. And don't
forget definitions!!!
<BR>
<BR>
Some of the suggested problems are True/False questions. The answers
to those questions may be found <A HREF="probs.html">here</A>.
