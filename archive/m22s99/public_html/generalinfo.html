Homework and the workshops are <B> fundamental</B> components of this
course. They count <I>only</I> 20% in order to deemphasize the numerical
grades, and to discourage competition. The reward for hard work on the
homework and the workshops should be a better understanding of the
material - and consequently, better results on the examinations.
Students who do not do the homework or who do not participate in the
workshops will not receive a passing grade in the course regardless
of their performance on the exams.

<B>Examinations:</B> The Midterm exams will be part in class and
part take home. The Final Exam will be <B> entirely</B> take home.
It will be distributed on the last day of classes, Wednesday,
June 2nd, and will be due on Sunday, June 6th. Turning in the
exam early will be possible. Further details to follow.

<B>Workshop:</B> We will meet <B>every</B> Thursday during the x-hour,
12:00-12:50. Generally, there will be no lecture or new material.
Rather, we will go over the material from the three previous lectures
and/or discuss applications. The emphasis will be on participation.

<B>Assignments:</B>
<A HREF="assignments.html">Homework</A> will be assigned
<B>daily</B> via the web.
You are to turn in the <B>week's</B> assignment each Monday
morning at the <B>beginning</B> of class. <I> Late homework
will not be graded!</I> Homework is to be written neatly using
one side of 8 1/2 x 11 inch paper. Do not use paper from a spiral
notebook unless you can tear off the ragged edge. All papers
are to be stapled. 
<P>
I will lecture under the assumption that you have at least begun
to assimilate the concepts presented in the problems, so it will
be to your advantage to do the problems as they are assigned.
Waiting till the last minute will only hurt and not help your
gaining an understanding of the material.

<B>Honor Code:</B>
You are encouraged to get help on your homework. You can not
only get help in my office hours, but you should feel free
to discuss problems with classmates or friends. But ultimately
you must work the problems and write up your assignments by
yourself.

The in class portion of all exams will be closed book and
closed notes. You may use the text or class notes on the
take home portion of the exams, but no other sources are
allowed. You are not to give or receive help from anyone
during the examinations.

<B>Special Needs:</B>
Students with special needs or disabilities should contact me as
soon as possible so that we can arrange appropriate accommodations.
