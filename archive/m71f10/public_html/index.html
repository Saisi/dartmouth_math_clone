<ul><li>Last minute clarifications of Homework 7: 
<ul> -Page 257: problem 10, assume that P contains no zero divisors of R.</ul>

<ul> -Page 258: problem 23 follows from problem 25, so you need only prove the latter.</ul> 

<ul> -Page 301: problem 6, the ring structure can be described by showing the given ring isomorphic to a well-known ring or by showing the given ring isomorphic to one in which the binary operations are explicitly defined.</ul>

The solutions that a student submits must be written by him or her alone.
