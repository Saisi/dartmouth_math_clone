<h2>NEWS CENTER:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
There will be a special tutorial on Thursday from 7-9.
<li>I will have office hours on Thursday from 9-11.  I most likely will 
not be in on Friday.
<li> Our final exam has been scheduled for Saturday, March 10, from 
8:00am-10:00am <font color=red>in 104 Wilder</font>.  
Make sure your alarm clocks are working, and that you 
<font color=red><b>do not show up in Filene!</b></font>.
<li> The final exam will be cumulative, but it will concentrate on
the last third of the course.  Thus at least half the exam will
focus on material covered since the second midterm.
<li> Practice problems and solutions are available below.
</ul></font>

<h2>Course Basics:</h2> We will meet in the 11 period 
(a.k.a. Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 11:15 to 12:20).

It is each student's responsibility to be 
aware of important College deadlines laid out in the 
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/200101_cal.html">College Calendar</a>.
<p>
<h2>Textbook:</h2> Calculus, A Complete Course (4th edition) by Robert
A. Adams.
<p>
<h2>Instructor:</h2> <a href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~dana">Dana
P. Williams</a>.  Office: <a
href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~dana/jpg/choatemap.jpg">201 Choate
House</a>.  BlitzMail: <a

<p>
<h2>Exams:</h2> There will be two mid-term exams and a final exam.
The mid-term exams will be given from 4:00-6:00 pm in Filene
Auditorium on <b>Monday January 29th</b> and on Monday February 19th.
The final will be given at a time and place during the exam period
(March 10 - March 14) which will be scheduled by the Registrar's office near
the end of January.  No early exams will be given to accomodate
over-optimistic travel plans.  <p><b> Students having conflicts with
the mid-term exams should contact their instructor <font
color=green>early</font> to try to resolve them.</b>
<p>
<h2>Grading:</h2> Your grade in the course will be determined
primarily from the total points obtained on the three exams.  Homework scores 
will be used only to resolve borderline cases.

<p>
<h2>Homework Policy:</h2> Homework is an essential part of the course,
and it is absurd to think a student could learn the material in Math 8
without working all the assigned homework (and possibly additional
problems as well).  Written homework will be assigned daily and will
be due before the next class meeting. Homework will be turned in to
and picked up from the boxes outside of the lecture hall. Late papers
will not be graded. Missing papers count zero. Moreover, neatness
counts; if the grader can't read your paper, you get no credit.
<p>
Homework will be graded primarily to provide feedback for the
student. As a result, homework scores will be used used only in
helping to determine borderline grades, and will be graded on an 0 - 2
point scale: 2, mostly correct; 1, about half correct, 0; mostly
incorrect or missing. 
<p>
My policy of not counting homework scores directly should not be
interpreted as discounting the importance of homework.  I simply do
not believe in tricking or forcing college students to do what they
should do on their own.  Never the less, I can't help but point out
that every time I institute this policy, 
<b><i>there is a very strong correlation between those who
do not do the homework regularly and those who receive low exam
grades.</b></i>
<p>
<h2>Tutorials:</h2> To assist you with the homework and the course in
general, there will be evening tutorials every Tuesday, Thursday, and
Sunday evening from 7:00 to 9:00 pm in 105 Bradley Hall.  Tutorials
will begin on Sunday, January 7th.  

<h2><font color=red>The Honor
Principle</font>:</h2> 
<b>On exams</b>: No help given or
received. <font color=green> No calculators will allowed on
exams.</font> 
<p> 
<b>On homework</b>: Collaboration and the use of computers are 
permitted and
encouraged, but NO COPYING . 
In other words, you should feel free to use your computer and to
talk to other students, myself or the tutors while you are in the
process of thinking about a problem. However, when it comes time to
write up your solutions, you should do this by yourself without
outside assistance.
<p>
<h2>Special Needs:</h2>
Students with
special needs or disabilities should contact me as soon as possible so
that we can arrange appropriate accommodations.
