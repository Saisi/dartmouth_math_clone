<p>After giving a large group of people two tests, time to win a video game and time to assemble a puzzle, the summary data is as follows.<br>
video game mean: 4 minutes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; video game SD: 1.5 minutes<br>
puzzle mean: 3 minutes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; puzzle SD: 1 minute<br>
r = 0.7
<ol><li>What percentage of the people at the 80th percentile for the video game do you expect to also be at or above the 80th percentile for the puzzle? <font color="midnightblue"><b>36.3%</b></font></li>
<li>What is the predicted score on the puzzle test for someone at the 80th percentile on the video game test? <font color="midnightblue"><b>3.6</b></font></li>
<li>If the actual score pair for someone is (5.3, 4), where the video game time is first and the puzzle time second, what is the error for that prediction? <font color="midnightblue"><b>0.4</b></font></li>
<li>Of course in timed tests we usually think of "better" scores as shorter times.  For this problem, then, define 80th percentile to be the score less than or equal to 80% of the times.  Does that change affect your answer to part 1?  What does it make the answer to part 2?  What would the time for the puzzle test be in part 3 to make the error the same as in part 3 but with the video game score now the 80th percentile defined in this way? <font color="midnightblue"><b>Part 1 is the same.  Part 2 is now 2.4.  For part 3 the pair would be (2.7, 2.8).</b></font></li>
<li>What assumption are you making to compute these estimates?  How valid do you think it is - how well do you think your estimates should correspond to reality, especially in part 4 as compared to parts 1-3? <font color="midnightblue"><b>We are assuming normal distribution and homoscedasticity for all the computations, and can exploit the symmetry of the normal distribution and the regression estimate (in the latter case, symmetry about the point of averages, with respect to the SD line) to get the new part 1 without recomputing anything, and know that for part 2 we can just go the same distance down from the mean that we previously went up.  Of course, the normality assumption has the problem that no one can solve the puzzle or win the game in 0 or fewer minutes, so the tail is cut off; this affects part 4 more than 1-3.  However, for the puzzle 0 is 3 SDs away from the mean, and for the video game it is 2 2/3 SDs away.  In the latter case that means our approximation puts about 0.4% of the outcomes at impossible values, but since that is a very small percentage (and for the puzzle the percentage is even smaller: 0.135%) it shouldn't affect things too badly.</b></font></li>

<p>Special Review (temporary):</p>

<p>Chapter 29 Section 8, p 565: #5 Since this is different people for each age we cannot conclude anything about changing lifestyles; it is most likely to be the result of people with healthier lifestyles living longer and thus being a larger percentage of the older population. #6 The mean is so much larger than the median you know the top 50% covers a <i>much</i> larger spread than the lower 50%; it is possible that this is concentrated at the top 10%, but far more likely that the distance between the 90th and 50th percentiles is much larger than the distance between the 50th and 10th percentiles. #7 Looks fine: strong positive correlation, a few outliers, all dots on whole numbers because grownups don't usually say "I'm 47 and a half". #8 r=2/3. #9b D is using an ecological correlation, which usually (though not always) increases the strength of correlation. #10 (iii). #11 65.5. #13 just about (provided the data is homoscedastic); this is the rms error. #14 29935. #15 (a) 1/5525 = 0.02%; (b) 4324/5525 = 78.3%; (c) 38/85 = 44.7%; (d) 47/85 = 55.3%. #16 5/11664 = 0.043%. #20 80.64% (the sample average and SD are red herrings). #21 (i) - the correction factors are both extremely close to 1. #25 (a) (i); (b) (ii); (c) (iii), (ii). #26 (a) T; (b) T; (c) F; (d) unknown; (e) unknown but likely; (f) F (square root of 2). #34 (a) T (generously rounded); (b) F; (c) F. #37 (a) (i) no, our techniques only apply to sample random samples; (ii) we simply can't answer this based on data alone; (b) (i) P < 1%; conclude there is a difference.</p>

<li>State your results in terms of (conditional) probability: what seems to be wrong with the program? [you may be able to read this by highlighting it; otherwise copy it into a text file or email:] <font color="#BFFDBF"><b>The frequencies obtained line up with the probabilities of getting outcome X on draw Y, and three of the probabilities of getting outcome X on draw 2 given you got outcome Y on draw 1, but the conditional probabilities for draw 2 given outcome 3 on draw 1 are somehow not being followed.  (Of course the conditional probabilities are the same as the ordinary probabilities because the draws are independent, but the data we use to test them is a subset of the data we use to test the nonconditional probabilities.)</b></font></li></ol>

<li>Deal five cards from a well-shuffled deck.  Let event A be that the first card is a face cards and the remaining cards are half black and half red.  Let event B be that the first card is a heart and the remaining cards are all non-face cards (A-10) in diamonds and spades.  What is the probability of the event A or B? <font color="midnightblue"><b>40897/433160 = 9.4% (prob A = 75/833; prob B = 19/3920; prob (A and B) = 81/173264)</b></font></li>
<li>For a certain large group of exercisers, the duration of each workout and the number of workouts per week are slightly negatively correlated.  The average duration is 1.5 hours and the average frequency is 2.75 times per week, with SDs of 0.5 and 1, respectively.  The correlation is r = -0.3 and the data is homoscedastic.
<ol type="a"><li>Approximately what percentage of the exercisers who work out for 1.5 hours at a time work out at least three times per week? <font color="midnightblue"><b>40%</b></font></li>
<li>Approximately what percentage of the exercisers who work out twice a week work out for no more than 1 hour at a time? <font color="midnightblue"><b>10%</b></font></li>
<li>If you choose an exerciser from the group at random, what is the probability that
<ol type="i"><li>he or she works out at least three times a week? <font color="midnightblue"><b>40%</b></font></li>
<li>he or she works out at most one hour at a time? <font color="midnightblue"><b>16%</b></font></li></ol>
</li></ol></li>
<li>For a recent graduating class of over one million high school students, the ACT and SAT scores were essentially normally distributed with ACT mean 20.8 and standard deviation 4.8 points, and SAT mean 1026 with standard deviation 209 points (the ACT is on a scale from 1 to 36 and the SAT from 400 to 1600).
<ol type="a"><li>If ACT and SAT scores are perfectly positively correlated, what score on the SAT is equivalent to a score of 30 on the ACT? <font color="midnightblue"><b>1427 (if you round your ACT z-value you should get 1423)</b></font></li>
<li>If ACT and SAT scores are perfectly positively correlated, what score is better, 1240 on the SAT or 25 on the ACT? <font color="midnightblue"><b>1240 (its z-value is greater than 1; 25's is less than 1)</b></font></li>
<li>What is the 80th percentile for ACT scores? <font color="midnightblue"><b>24.88 (or 25, since you don't get fractional scores)</b></font></li>

<p>Examples from Class: (<a href="examples.html">fully worked out</a>)</p>

<p>A simple random sample of 400 people from a population of 100,000 is surveyed in the fall, and another sample the following spring.  The fall sample showed 41% of people in favor of repaving downtown; the average time per week spent downtown was 4 hours with a standard deviation of 2 hours.  In the spring, 45% were in favor of repaving and the average weekly time spent downtown was 3.5 hours with a standard deviation of 1.75 hours.  For each of the two things measured, find (a) a 95% confidence interval for the population parameter for the fall survey, and (b) whether it appears there was a real change from the fall to the spring. <font color="midnightblue"><b>Repaving: (a) 36.1-45.9%, (b) no; P = 12.5%.  Time spent downtown: (a) 3.8-4.2 hours/week, (b) yes; P = 0.009%.</b></font></p>

<p>1. Roll a die five times.  What is the probability of getting a 1 first, and then half even numbers and half odd numbers? <font color="midnightblue"><b>6.25%</b></font><br>
2. Deal four cards from a well-shuffled deck.  What is the probability of getting exactly one heart and exactly one face card? <font color="midnightblue"><b>19%</b></font><br>
3. Roll six dice.  What is the probability of getting at least one 3 or 4? <font color="midnightblue"><b>91.2%</b></font></p>

<p>A person claiming to have invented a new source of energy releases data from successive trial runs of the machine.  The data, converted into standard units via the average power produced and the standard deviation of the values, is presented in terms of unit intervals below.  One would expect the amounts to be normally distributed; at this level of detail do they appear to be? <font color="midnightblue"><b>Yes, a little too well: P is just under 99%.</b></font></p>
