<p><b>How class will run</b>: Most days will be lecture at the chalkboard and work on the computer.  Each Friday we will begin with a short <b>quiz</b> that covers homework assigned up to and including the Wednesday of that week.  Homework will be assigned (nearly) daily but graded <i>only</i> via these quizzes.  Quizzes will be closed-book, except (if applicable) a printout of the week's computations in Excel (or another statistics package of your choice).  To help you prepare for quizzes, tutorials are Tuesday and Thursday evenings 7-9 in Kemeny 006 except as noted below.</p>

<p><b>Special weeks</b></p>

<p><ul><li>April 19-23: Tutorial Sunday 7-9, regular class Monday, tutorial Tuesday 7-9, Wednesday in-class review and evening <b>midterm</b> (4/21, 5-7 pm, Kemeny 00<b>8</b>), no x-hour or Thursday tutorial, regular class Friday but no quiz.</li>
<li>May 10-14: Tutorial Sunday 7-9, regular class Monday, tutorial Tuesday 7-9, Wednesday in-class review and evening <b>midterm</b> (5/12, 5-7 pm, Kemeny 00<b>8</b>), no x-hour or Thursday tutorial, regular class Friday but no quiz.</li>
<li>May 24-28: No class except Friday (5/28), as I will be out of town.  We will finish new material the week before, I will grade your quizzes to be available to you before I leave, and I will be available by email while gone.  Tutorial will still run Tuesday and Thursday evenings.  Friday class will be review.</li>

<p><b>Honor Principle:</b> On the exams, no help is to be given or received.</p>

<p><b>Students with disabilities:</b> I encourage students with disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases and learning disabilities, to discuss with me any appropriate accommodations that might be helpful.</p>
