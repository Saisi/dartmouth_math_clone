<li>Suppose I now tell you that the mean of the plant heights is 6.5 cm and the standard deviation is 1.5 cm.  What assumption do you need to make to draw conclusions about the probability of height when you choose a plant at random from the sample?

<p>Except for the concept of a probability histogram, which we saw all the way back in part II, and the basic idea of the Central Limit Theorem (that the distribution of sums of draws approaches the normal curve as the number of draws increases, and therefore it is valid for large number of draws to use the normal curve to estimate percentages), we are skipping this chapter.

<p>The book actually does a good job covering the topics I would like you to be comfortable with.  Here is one extra multi-part problem for part III.</p>

<p>After giving a large group of people two tests, time to win a video game and time to assemble a puzzle, the summary data is as follows.<br>
video game mean: 4 minutes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; video game SD: 1.5 minutes<br>
puzzle mean: 3 minutes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; puzzle SD: 1 minute<br>
r = 0.7
<ol><li>What percentage of the people at the 80th percentile for the video game do you expect to also be at or above the 80th percentile for the puzzle?</li>
<li>What is the predicted score on the puzzle test for someone at the 80th percentile on the video game test?</li>
<li>If the actual score pair for someone is (5.3, 4), where the video game time is first and the puzzle time second, what is the error for that prediction?</li>
<li>Of course in timed tests we usually think of "better" scores as shorter times.  For this problem, then, define 80th percentile to be the score less than or equal to 80% of the times.  Does that change affect your answer to part 1?  What does it make the answer to part 2?  What would the time for the puzzle test be in part 3 to make the error the same as in part 3 but with the video game score now the 80th percentile defined in this way?</li>
<li>What assumption are you making to compute these estimates?  How valid do you think it is - how well do you think your estimates should correspond to reality, especially in part 4 as compared to parts 1-3? [note: this question is a lot more vague than any that would appear on the exam and exists really for me to comment on the problem.]</li>

<p>Download this spreadsheet of the weights of Cherry Ripe candy bars (an Australian brand): <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m10s10/cherryripe.csv">csv</a>, <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m10s10/cherryripe.txt">txt</a>.  This is from Dunn's <a href="http://www.sci.usq.edu.au/staff/dunn/Datasets/applications/popular/cherryripe.html">Data Sets for Statistical Analysis</a>.
<ol><li>Compute 68% and 95% confidence intervals for the weight of the bars (note your intervals will be in raw numbers, not percentages, but the method is the same, using the appropriate SE).</li>
<li>Unfortunately since the sample is small the intervals are wide, but Dunn says every time he has done this experiment with students the weights have been over the advertised weight of 18 grams.  If that is a real phenomenon, why do you think it occurs?</li></ol>

<p><ol><li>From Johnson and Bhattacharyya, Statistics: Principles and Methods: Out of 100 people who volunteered to donate blood, the frequency of blood types was as follows: 40 O, 44 A, 10 B, and 6 AB.  Use the &chi;<sup>2</sup> method to test the hypothesis that (a) all four blood types are equally distributed in the population of potential donors, and (b) O and A are each four times as common as B or AB.

<li>Check the distribution of values on the second draw.</li>
<li>Check the distribution of values on second draw for each first draw value.</li>
<li>State your results in terms of (conditional) probability: what seems to be wrong with the program? (this answer will be hidden so if you don't want to do the first three parts you can read their answers and still try this one)</li></ol>
</li>
<li>Deal five cards from a well-shuffled deck.  Let event A be that the first card is a face cards and the remaining cards are half black and half red.  Let event B be that the first card is a heart and the remaining cards are all non-face cards (A-10) in diamonds and spades.  What is the probability of the event A or B?</li>
<li>For a certain large group of exercisers, the duration of each workout and the number of workouts per week are slightly negatively correlated.  The average duration is 1.5 hours and the average frequency is 2.75 times per week, with SDs of 0.5 and 1, respectively.  The correlation is r = -0.3 and the data is homoscedastic.
<ol type="a"><li>Approximately what percentage of the exercisers who work out for 1.5 hours at a time work out at least three times per week?</li>
<li>Approximately what percentage of the exercisers who work out twice a week work out for no more than 1 hour at a time?</li>
<li>If you choose an exerciser from the group at random, what is the probability that
<ol type="i"><li>he or she works out at least three times a week?</li>
<li>he or she works out at most one hour at a time?</li></ol>

<li>For a recent graduating class of over one million high school students, the ACT and SAT scores were essentially normally distributed with ACT mean 20.8 and standard deviation 4.8 points, and SAT mean 1026 with standard deviation 209 points (the ACT is on a scale from 1 to 36 and the SAT from 400 to 1600).
<ol type="a"><li>If ACT and SAT scores are perfectly positively correlated, what score on the SAT is equivalent to a score of 30 on the ACT?</li>
<li>If ACT and SAT scores are perfectly positively correlated, what score is better, 1240 on the SAT or 25 on the ACT?</li>
<li>What is the 80th percentile for ACT scores?</li>

<p>Examples from Class: (<a href="answers.html#final">answers only</a>, <a href="examples.html">fully worked out</a>)</p>

<p>A simple random sample of 400 people from a population of 100,000 is surveyed in the fall, and another sample the following spring.  The fall sample showed 41% of people in favor of repaving downtown; the average time per week spent downtown was 4 hours with a standard deviation of 2 hours.  In the spring, 45% were in favor of repaving and the average weekly time spent downtown was 3.5 hours with a standard deviation of 1.75 hours.  For each of the two things measured, find (a) a 95% confidence interval for the population parameter for the fall survey, and (b) whether it appears there was a real change from the fall to the spring.</p>

<p>1. Roll a die five times.  What is the probability of getting a 1 first, and then half even numbers and half odd numbers?<br>
2. Deal four cards from a well-shuffled deck.  What is the probability of getting exactly one heart and exactly one face card?<br>
3. Roll six dice.  What is the probability of getting at least one 3 or 4?</p>

<p>A person claiming to have invented a new source of energy releases data from successive trial runs of the machine.
