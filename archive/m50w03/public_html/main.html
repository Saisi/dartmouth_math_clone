<br><b>Homework, Readings:</b>
<br>(1) Weekly problem sets - assigned on Fridays, due on Wednesday<br>
<br>(2) "real statistics" - Each week you must find one news item of statistical interest
and write it up in a pargraph or two for posting on the web. You may also search the 
<A HREF ="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance">CHANCE Project website</A> for old articles of interest.
Each Friday, a few  students will be picked (at random!) to present their choices.<br>

<br>

<br><b>Grading:</b>
<br>Grades in Math 50 will be based on homework, exams, final projects.  
Your lowest two homework grades will be dropped before computing your 
end-of-term average.  Homework will be graded on a scale of 1-10; 
5 points will be automatic if you make an attempt at every problem.  Late homework will 
receive 5 points and will not be graded. <br>

<br>Your final grade will be computed as: <br>
Homework 30%, "real news" 5%, project 20%, midterm 20%, final 25%.<br>

<br>Grades in Math 50 are not curved; 
other students' good performance will not hurt your grade.  (So
 please work together and help each other out.)  The grade scale is: 93% A, 90% A-, 85% B+, 
 75% B, 70% B-, 67% C+, 63% C, 60% C-, 55% D+, 50% D.<br>

<br><b>Honor Principle:</b>
<br>Every student who matriculates at Dartmouth agrees to abide by the
academic honor principle.  You have an obligation to act with integrity in your own academic
work, and to take action if you observe honor code violations by others.  Academic integrity
is essential to the scientific enterprise and I take it seriously.<br>

<br>
In Math 50 you are encouraged to work together on homework problems, and to use professors,
other students, other textbooks, and generally any resource you can find that will
help you understand and work the problems.  You must write up the homework solutions by
yourself in your own words.<br>

<br>You must do all work on exams independently, without giving or receiving assistance of any
kind.<br>

<br><b>Special Needs:</b>
<br>If you have a disability of any sort that may affect your participation in the course or require
accommodations, please speak to the professor at the beginning of the term.  These conversations will be completely
confidential, with the single exception that the professor may contact the Student Disabilities Coordinator at
the Academic Skills Center to discuss appropriate accommodations.  Students with disabilities that may need
classroom accommodations should also talk to the Student Disabilities Coordinator directly.<br>

<br>Please talk to Professor Rockmore as soon as possible, or whenever
something comes up, about any special concerns you have about the class.  If you
have athletic or other extracurricular commitments and hope to accomodate them (for example,
by taking midterms at alternative times), talk to the professor.  If you are in any way
concerned about the course or your performance in it, talk to the professor.<br>

<br>If you can't do the homework, talk to the professor.  Also talk to the tutor about any of
your concerns.  Make an appointment if you can't make our regular hours.  We are here and we
want to see you.<br>

<h2>Exam Information</h2>

There will be one midterm exam: 
a take-home, picked up on <b> Tuesday, February 4 </b> and
returned in class the next day. 
If you have a conflict with a midterm exam, please talk to Prof.
Rockmore  <b>as soon as possible</b> about scheduling an alternate time.  With less than a week's notice, scheduling 
an alternate time may not be possible.  Final exmas are given only during the scheduled time.<br>
<br>The first midterm covers the course material in the first four weeks of the course, the second covers the material 
in the second four weeks, and the final is cumulative.  Remember that problems on exams will require you to know and use 
physics as well as math concepts.<br>
<br>Check this website before the midterms for review material.<br>
