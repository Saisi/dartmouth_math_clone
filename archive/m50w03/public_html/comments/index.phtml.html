<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>This article reveals how confused and split the U.S. is on the issue of affirmative action, and it also illustrates the impact of the wording of questions on the statistical results of a poll.  According to a recent AP poll, about 4 out of 5 Americans believe that it is important to have a racially diverse student body, but only 51 percent feel that affirmative action programs are still necessary to help minorities.  However, 89 percent of black respondents feel that affirmative action needs to be continued, along with 60 percent of all young adults (ages 18 to 34 years old).  So while most Americans agree that a problem exists in terms of racial parity in career advancement and college entrance, few  people can agree on the means to solve the problem.  In fact, simple differences in the descriptions of possible solutions can lead to huge differences in approval.  For instance, when the AP poll asked individuals if they thought programs should continue that give "advantages and preferences" to minorities in hiring, promotions and college admissions, 53 percent yes, while 35 percent felt they should be abolished, with an error of plus or minus 3%.  Yet when another recent poll asked if race should be used as a factor in college admissions, people were opposed by a 2-1 margin.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency announces that the antimissile interceptors have high successful rate-88%. The claim is based on 25 tests, including both long-range and short-range interceptors. One of the speakers is quoted: "This high rate of endgame success shows the feasibility of missile defense. The availability of technologies to protect the nation should not be in question." Notice, however, the rate of endgame success is hardly indicative of the overall rate of success, which involves processes prior to endgame. Quality control errors could and have occurred during these processes. Researchers find the overall success rate to be a mere 41%. The antimissile system really isn't that great.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>This is a fascinating piece on how people could make decisions that deviate from the rules of probability. There are two urns and both contain either red or black balls. The proportion of both kinds of balls in urn1 is unknown, but the proportion in urn2 is 50/50. When people are told that they will receive $100 if they pick a red ball, most of them decide to pick from urn2. Notice, however, whether urn1 or urn2 has a larger proportion for red balls is unknown. To make the game more interesting, we call it a "red bet" if the bet is to pick a red ball and a "black bet" if the bet is to pick a black ball. Stats show that some people choose urn2 for both a black bet and a red bet. That is to say, these people believe that there is a higher probability to pick a red ball in urn2 than in urn1, and there is a higher probability to pick a black ball in urn2 than in urn1. This perception contradicts the rules of probability.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>A recent study suggests that children receive better care when visiting doctors is aided with a computer system. The system used in the study is an electronic form that takes in comprehensive info about the patients. The study includes a total of 235 paper-based visits (before the system is introduced) and 986 computer-based visits for children under five. Apparently, with the computer system, doctors are more likely to discuss with patients issues including exposure to domestic or community violence, guns in the home, behavioral milestones, infant sleep position, poison control, child safety and sleep in general. Also, four of the seven doctors using computer-based systems reported that office visits were longer (about 9.3 minutes). Such phenomenon may be explained by that doctors become more comprehensive with computers because the system provides a complete questionnaire and makes dynamic questions for the patients based on different answers.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Traffic citations reveal disparity in police searches.
Totals, hometowns key to computations.
Boston Globe, 6 January 2003, A7
Bill Dedman and Francie LaTour 

When racial profiling gained a lot of media attention, Massachusetts decided to conduct a study of racial profiling in their practicing traffic enforcement divisions.  Looking at the distributions of races who were stopped, it was shown that blacks and Hispanics were ticketed in proportions around double their proportion in the actual population.  Black people are also ticketed in their home towns in proportions up to 4 times their representation in the town.  Non-white races also had a higher instance of having their car searched, although illegal substances were found more often in the cars of white people.  
This is pretty interesting because there are many stereotypes that must contribute to this racial profiling, along with the fact that the study was conducted in a New England state where fewer minorities are present than in other parts of the country.  It would be interesting to conduct the same study in Los Angeles or Chicago, and then compare the data to the Massachusettes data.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>A big problem for research in economics, sociology and  medicine is the difficulty of finding a controlled experiment to work with. For example, it would be really nice to be able to randomly select half the people in your sample and force them to do another year of schooling (treatment), and take the other half and force them not to do it. Then you can estimate the effect the additional year of schooling had on their wages. The fact that the people were randomly selected eliminates the problem of self-selection and so you can really isolate the specific effect of 1 extra year of schooling. 

Researchers have been trying to somehow create these "natural experiments" with randomly selected people being subjected to a "treatment" and one interesting example comes from the field of medicine: a doctor in the US wanted to see if knee-surgery really helps relieve arthritis, or if it's in fact the psychological effect of having the surgery done that is at work. So he had a group of patients, all planning to get surgery. They agreed to be a part of his experiment, so he randomly divided the group in two parts: half would not go in the operating room, and the other half would. Of those that would go in the operating room, half would get real surgery, and half would just get their knee opened up (so that they couldn't tell whether they had surgery or not). The doctor randomly selected which patient would actually get the surgery and which not. He then monitored the three groups. If knee surgery is important, we would expect the guys that didn't get cut and the guys that got cut but didn;t really have the surgery to have the same outcome, and the patients who got the real thing to have better outcome. He discovered that the guys who had been cut (regardless of whether or not they had actually had proper surgery) felt better afterwards, proving the strong psychological impact of the surgery. 
<br>
There are other examples of this type of created experiment, with brain surgery, heart surgery, testing a new pill, etc... nowadays the patients agree to be part of the experiment (they just don't know if they are in the treatment group or not) but 50 years ago, a guy did this with heart surgery and never told the patients.... </TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>
The article reviews current statistics concerning America's job market and unemployment rate.  It examines whether the economy has been improving, or if it is still on the decline.  Many of the jobs being lost are in the service-producing industry.  In a related article, at website http://money.cnn.com/pf/features/lists/state_unemployment/, CNN goes through which states have been hit hardest by the increased unemployment and which ones still have relatively low unemployments rates.  The statistics here are interesting because of the other variables that will effect the unemployment rate.  For example, many midwest states have much fewer young people, and many senior citizens.  The young people are more likely to be out of work, while the senior citizens are not counted in the unemployment rate.  The effects of the population demographics on employment would be an interesting analysis to see, which could be based from the data in the articles.  About to enter the job market myself, I find this statistics particularly interesting.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>The college admissions process has always been a controversial and emotionally charged one in the light of bending requirements for minority applicants, legacies, athletes and children of donors.  The issue currently sits before the Supreme Court as 16 minority students are suing Michigan Law School for their race-conscious admissions policies.  

<p>

The admissions process has never been equal for everyone. Universities have been known -- and criticized -- for bending the rules for athletes and children of major donors. Legacy preferences became popular in the 19th century as a way of keeping alumni fathers happy and limiting the number of Jewish applicants.  One question that is being asked is "Is the practice of favoring legacies inherantly racist?" since whites have been privileged for far longer than minorities to attend the nation's best schools?  

<p>

At the University of Virginia, 11 percent of this year's freshmen class were children of alumni -- and more than 91 percent of them are white. U.Va. education researcher Cameron Howell estimates it will take 17 more years before Virginia's legacy population resembles the racial diversity of its current student population, which is about 70 percent white, 11 percent Asian American, 9 percent black and 3 percent Hispanic. It will take 17 more years until the children of UVA's current minority students to apply to the school, to shift the legacy racial makeup from predominantly white as it is today to a racial makeup that mirrors the overall school population.  However, this aim will only be achieved if legacies continue to receive preferential treatment over other applicants.

<p> 

It seems that this practice which is currently unfair to minorities needs to continue in order for it to eventually to be fair to everybody.  </TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>"Would you like to supersize that?" may be a common phrase that we hear at our favorite fast food chain.  Translation: "Would you like an especially big serving of french fries and an especially big cup of soda to wash it all down?"  However, this phenomenon is the norm even at home. 

<p>

Researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill analyzed three government surveys taken over two decades and reviewed answers to the average portion size consumed for specific foods, such as snacks, desserts and soft drinks.  They found that between 1977 and 1996, food portion sizes increased both inside and outside the home for all categories except pizza.  For example, 

<p>

Americans are eating per portion, on average: 

<p>

• 93 more calories from salty snacks, such as potato chips, pretzels and popcorn. 

<p>

• 49 more calories from soft drinks. 

<p>

• 97 more calories from hamburgers. 

<p>

• 68 more calories from French fries. 

<p>

• 133 more calories from Mexican food, such as burritos, tacos, enchiladas. 

<p>

These increases in mean calories from such categories are significant since they are increases in means, not just for one person.  The population as a whole are increasing their calorie intake.  

Researchers attribute this problem to the fact that Americans tend to overestimate what the appropriate serving size is because serving sizes at restaurants are exceedingly large.  

Obviously this phenomenon contributes to the problem of obesity we have in this country.

<TD ALIGN=left></B>  The study reveals that being overweight takes 3 years off your life, and being obese will take 6 or 7 years off your life.  If you are a smoker and obese, you are likely to live 13 years less.  The data comes from over 3400 adults, aged 28 to 62 living in Massachusetts, studided from 1948-1990.
<BR>  Thsi information is very relevant to today's world because two-thirds of adult Americans are overweight or obese, and we are getting fatter, younger.  But all the recent technological and health advances have been greatly increasing our life expectancy.  I wonder what effect these advances have on the different life expectancies.  Do they decrease the gap or increase it?  A long-term study performed in a different region of the country would also be interesting, because environment will have a huge impact on life expectancy.  </TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>Art history and statistics? Few people would make a connection between these two seemingly very different domains, but University of Chicago economist David Galenson has tried to do so. In his book Painting Outside the Lines: Patterns of Creativity in Modern Art, he analyzes avant-garde art from a statistical perspective. What he finds out is that there are two distinct patterns of artistic innovation, which he calls the experimental and conceptual patterns. Experimentalists such as Cezanne tend to improve their art gradually, whereas conceptualists like Picasso make sudden great improvements. Galenson measures improvement by looking at the market prices of the paintings, assuming that artistic talent and creativity are just like ordinary goods, which get a certain price based on their quality. He concludes that experimental artists produce their best paintings towards the end of their lives, whereas conceptualists tend to produce masterpieces much earlier. His approach has been criticized by many art historians for two reasons: First, it assumes a linear relationship between the quality of a painting as determined by its critical evaluation, and its market price as determined by popular demand. In other words, critics say the most sought-after paintings of a particular artist might not be his or her best works. Second, art historians doubt Galenson's claim that he can use prices to infer details about the artist and his work - for example, to "predict what the artist said about his work and how he made preparatory drawings." Art historians tend to view each artist and each work of art as a unique phenomenon, and are very skeptical about such generalized statistical laws. </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Underage drinkers account for nearly 20 percent of the alcohol consumed in the United States each year, a study says. <br>

Researchers from Columbia University's National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse analyzed three sets of data from 1999 and said underage drinking amounted to 19.7 percent of alcohol consumed that year, or $22.5 billion. 
"Excessive" drinking by adults — consumption of more than two drinks daily — amounted to 30.4 percent, or $34.4 billion, the researchers said. The researchers' definition of excessive drinking is anything exceeding government guidelines for moderate drinking. <BR>

It included data from the 1999 version of the household survey, which involved more than 50,000 people aged 12 and older questioned at home. It also included data from two surveys of youngsters 12 and older who were questioned at school. 


Representatives of the alcohol industry called the new study faulty , and questioned the researchers' definition of excessive adult drinking. <BR>
The government agency that conducts the household survey, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, has estimated the percentage of alcohol consumed by youngsters at 11.4 percent.

<TD ALIGN=left>A couple's work: Study says unmarried couples split chores better.
Boston Globe, 9 November 2002, B1.
Patricia Wen

A study found that for couples who live together before getting married, men do 4%more of daily chores than do men in relationships that just jump into marriage.  This is an interesting finding, however it is not clear if it was a matched pairs test or what other kind that would control for factors such as family backround, socioeconomic factors, or whether or not the women worked.  Because if the woman is a stay at home housewife or something she would most likely perform more of the household chores, or if she is from a family where her mother did more of the chores, she would be more inclined to perform them as well.  Possibly women in higher economic levels would be more independent (both financially and socially) so they will not be as willing to pull all the weight.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>Researchers at the Brigham and Women's Hospital recently released a study that found that women with rheumatoid arthritis may be twice as likely to suffer a heart attack than women without the condition.  It was also found that women who have arthritis for 10 years or more are three times as likely to have a heart attack than women without the joint condition.  The findings were part of a larger medical study that was conducted over a span of 20 years and involved more than 140,000 people, including 527 people with arthritis.  The study's scientists view the results as quite significant and have theorized that the link between the two conditions lies in the inflammatory component common to both of them.  The researchers hope that heart attacks in women may be prevented in the future by earlier anti-inflammatory treatment of arthritis.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Democracy and growth: An alternative empirical approach 

This paper proposes a “before-and-after” approach to empirical examination of the relationship between democracy and growth. Rather than the commonly used cross-country regression method, this paper compares the economic performances of forty countries before and after they became democracies or semi-democracies sometime within the last forty years. The empirical evidence indicates that an improvement in growth performance typically follows the transformation to democracy. Moreover, growth under democracy appears to be more stable than under authoritarian regimes. Interestingly, wealthy countries often experience declines in growth after a democratic transformation, while very poor nations typically experience accelerations in growth. Growth change appears to be negatively related to the initial savings ratio and positively related to the export ratio to GDP. Partial correlation between growth change and primary school or secondary school enrollments and the ratio of government expenditure to GDP is not identified. </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>One out of four Americans said that overstating the value of insurance claims is acceptable, and more than 10 percent of them approved of submitting false claims for items that weren't lost or damaged, a study said. 
The survey, commissioned by Accenture and conducted by Taylor Nelson Sofres Intersearch, examined about 1,000 consumers' attitudes toward insurance fraud. It found that 16 percent of respondents thought overstating an insurance claim was "somewhat acceptable," while 7 percent thought the practice was "quite acceptable." A majority of respondents, 58 percent, felt that overstating a claim was "not at all acceptable." 
Insurance fraud is the second-largest economic crime in America after income tax evasion, and the cost of fraud in the property and casualty industry is approximately $24 billion per year, according to the Insurance Services Office. 

The study also concluded that two-thirds of Americans think people are more likely to commit insurance fraud during an economic downturn than when the economy is strong. 
The survey was comprised of telephone interviews with 1,030 U.S. adults in November 2002.

<TD ALIGN=left>The Center for Disease and Control's study shows that blacks and southerners are more likely to die because of stroke. Apparently, 40% more blacks than whites are killed by this disease, and southern states such as South Carolina, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and North Carolina have the highest rates. The reason for such phenomenon is not clear. Some speculate the health care conditions in regard to stroke is worse in the South; some suppose that geographical differences play a role as well--stroke is more widespread in lower latitudes. Interestingly, however, Florida is one of the states with the lowest rate. <p>Researchers hope that the stats can help policymakers better allocate resources to prevent stroke disease where it is most rampant.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>This past month, the national average for unleaded gasoline prices rose 13% from $1.469 to $1.663 according to the American Automobile Association (AAA).  The highest prices surveyed by the AAA occurred in June 2001 when the average price was $1.718.  Because the gasoline prices at the pumps have risen to such high levels, public officials and consumer groups are saying that gas gouging is going on.  The FTC is monitoring the situation but only has the authority to act on price fixing between competitors, rather than gas gouging.  But several experts in the oil industry have noted that the current prices are not actually that high once they are adjusted for inflation.
<P>
Furthermore, the crude oil prices have increased about as much as the prices at the pumps.  But it is unclear how much the two of these prices are correlated.  So it would be interesting to see how closely the two of these prices move, and that would help determine the likelihood of gas gouging.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>A recently published study by researchers from Dartmouth Medical School and Veteran Affairs Medical Center in White River Junction, Vt. has examined the relationship between the amount and the quality of health care in different regions of the United States. The quantity of medical services varies significantly (by as much as 60%) among US regions. However, the study shows that the quality of and access to health care, as well as the outcomes and patient satisfaction are not better or higher in regions where the quantity of care is greater. In fact, such regions may even do worse on some quality criteria such as access to preventive care or outpatient services. The researchers claim that in some regions as much as 30 percent of medical services do not actually lead to improvement in the quality of health care. Such expenses usually go towards creating additional hospital beds and positions for medical specialists, which do not increase the patients' survival rates or levels of satisfaction. This suggests, according to the researchers, that conservative, low-cost health care patterns are more efficient and should be adopted by all US regions. Medical institutions should focus their attention on providing appropriate, personalized, high-quality health care to their patients rather than spend their resources on unnecessary tests, procedures, physician visits, and inpatient stays. </TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>In a thought provoking cause-and-effect study, The Energy Information Administration reported that the fact that 2001 pollution linked to climate change declined by 1.2 percent (the first such decline in a decade) can be directly linked to the slumping economy and high electricity costs.  The EIA attributes the decrease to 

<p>

• A 3.5 percent decline in overall economic growth. 

<p>

• A 4.4 percent reduction in manufacturing output. 

<p>

• An unusually warm winter that curtailed demand for heating oil and natural gas. 

<p>

• A drop in electricity demand, especially in the West, where high prices caused people to conserve. 

<p>

In the wake of the slumping economy coupled with the warmer winter, people have logically reduced their consumption of luxury goods (heat) that they can do without.  As people all over the world have been hit by falling stock prices and rising unemployment, at least we can take solace in the a reduction in greenhouse gas releases.  </TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 30 million of the 42 million people in the world living with the AIDS virus.  Scientists are therefore very interested in why the disease is spreading so rampantly in this part of the world.  Most scientists believe heterosexual sex spreads HIV/AIDS in up to 90 percent of adult cases in this geographical region.  

<p>

However, a team of eight researchers hailing from three countries who reviewed data on HIV infection in Africa estimate a report published in the International Journal of STD & AIDS that only about a third of adult cases in Sub-Saharan Africa are sexually transmitted.  They claim that the majority of infections are actually caused by unsafe blood transfusions and injections.  Scientists on this team state that "The idea that sex explains 90 percent of African HIV just doesn't fit the facts."

<p>

Nevertheless, the claim of this team of researchers is also under attack.  A common assult is "In Kenya, medical procedures have largely been made safe but still HIV infections continue to rise."  The question that these researchers are trying to answer is extremely complex.  They are trying to isolate the percentage of cases caused by sex vs. blood transfusions.  However, many HIV positive patients may be suseptable to both causes.  Another questions is how easily is the virus transmitted through blood transfusions vs. sex.

<TD ALIGN=left>In a recent court case, the reliability of fingerprinting as a method of identifying people was questioned. It was pointed out that fingerprinting does not match one of the so-called Daubert criteria for the reliability of legal evidence. In particular, its rate of error is not known. Methods to estimate the probability of two people having the same fingerprint have been designed before. The first person to propose such a method was Sir Francis Galton. He used an enlarged photograph of a fingerprint and dropped small paper squares on it. Then he tried to infer the features hidden behind each square from the surrounding pattern, which he could see. He found out that he could correctly guess the hidden features with probability 0.5 if he used squares of size 5 fingerprint ridges per edge. Then he divided the fingerprint into 24 such squares, and assuming independence, calculated the probability of guessing the entire pattern by looking at its margins to be 0.5^24. Finally, he multiplied it by the probability to have a particular set of margins and obtained that the probability of a given fingerprint pattern is 1.45 * 10^(-11). This meant that if one chose a random fingerprint, there was a chance of 1/4 of finding another person with the same fingerprint. In my opinion, this probability might be somewhat higher, since not all patterns are equally likely to occur - some might never even occur. A method that takes this into account was proposed by Osterburg et al. They developed Galton's basic idea of subdividing the fingerprint into small squares and used the experimentally observed probabilities of finding different small features (minutiae) in a given square to calculate the total probability of a particular configuration. </TD>

There's always been a lot of confusion over the positive and negative effects of marijuana.  In the recent debate over legalizing marijuana in some states, these questions turn to the medicinal effects of the drug.  most articles that you read are extremely bias, but here's a webpage of interesting statistics.  The website states that  400,000 people die annually from tobacco, 110,00 from alcohol, 100,000 from prescription drugs, 30,000 from suicide, 7600 from aspirin, but 0 from marijuana.  "no information about marijuana-related deaths exists."  These estimates are a little different than what those new federal anti-marijuana commercials lead one to believe.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>While several past medical studies have found that moderate consumption of alcohol may help to prevent heart attacks, a recent study by Tulane found that drinking may help to prevent strokes as well.  The researchers found that someone who had one to two drinks a day reduced their chances of ischemic stroke (the most common type of stroke) by 28 percent compared to those people who abstained from alcohol.  However, the researchers found reason to be wary of encouraging drinking; not surprisingly, those individuals who had five or more drinks a day had a 69 percent greater chance of stroke than did alcohol abstainers.  </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>A recent report published by the Columbia University National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) was found to incorrectly imply that children under 21 drink 25% of the alcohol consumed in the United States. The project surveyed over 25,000 people, 40% of whom were between 12 and 20 years old. In the study, the underage group composed 25% of the drinking population. The error arose because the researchers failed to consider that children from 12 to 20 account for only 11.4% of the U.S. population. Amazingly, no adjustment was made for the over-sampling and the role of underage drinkers in the American drinking scene was greatly exaggerated. </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Trust and Growth

In a paper written 5 years ago, Paul Zak and Stephenen Knack document a relationship between trust and economic growth. They use a sample of 37 countries, for a period of 22 years from 1970-1992, for which they gather data on investment, GDP growth per capita, initial GDP and investment (1970 levels), inflation and education levels (the typical variables included in growth regressions). They find that on average, trust (as measured by the World Values Survey) is higher in more ethnically, socially and economically homogeneous societies. Higher-trust societies in turn, exhibit higher rates of investment and growth, holding other economic and geographic variables constant. To estimate the correlation between trust and economic growth they use regression analysis, in an equation of the form growth = b0 + b1(trust index) + bx, where x=other control variables. The index b1 shows that for a 1-point increase in the trust index, the country would be expected to grow by an addional 0.1%, holding other parameters constant. 

While such results are interesting and rather intuitive (if people in a society trust each other, they are more likely to undertake efficient, profitable economic activities), I cannot help but wonder if the results suffer from what is called an endogeneity problem, with the trust index used actually being a proxy for other variables not included in the model, such as social stability, rule of law, and effective property rights and business regulations, which would in turn not only encourage economic growth, but also determine a high level of trust among people in that society. </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Education Gap for Hispanics
By MIREYA NAVARRO

The article details that 0nly 16 percent of Latino high school graduates earn a four-year college degree by age 29, compared with 37 percent of non-Hispanic whites and 21 percent of African-Americans, according to a recent study of census data by the Pew Hispanic Center. 

These lagging numbers are thought to be due to the lack of role models and practical college advice at home, as well as inadequate preparation from schools. There are also additional barriers of language and culture, particularly an attachment to the extended family. Latino teenagers stay at home more likely than going off to college, making it all the more likely that they get caught up in their families' financial needs.

<TD ALIGN=left>A researcher at University of North Carolina suggests that economic downturns can be good for people's health, in the long run. According to his data, 1% increase in state unemployment reduces smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity by .6%, .3%, and 1.8%, respectively. However, the direct correlation between indicators of economic downturns, such as unemployment rate, and the actual increase in everyone's well-being may not be established--many seem to agree. An example of such difficulty of conclusion is this: a laid-off worker might lose his insurance and decide to maintain health by working out; on the other hand, he might not make such a decision because of medicare. Hence the relation between his unemployment and any future health-related activity seems unpredictable. However, I believe this argument is not correct. While an individual worker's activity might not be predictable, the well-being of the general population may be following a certain pattern. There must be some other argument in support of the difficulty in establishing a correlation between economic downturn and increase in well-being.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This article discusses growing credit card debt of college students. According to a report published in July by the National Center for Education Statistics, nearly three quarters of undergraduates in the academic year 1999-2000 had credit cards in their names; 45 percent carried a balance from month to month; and the average balance due on all of a student's credit cards combined was $3,100. A study by Robert Manning shows that over the last 10 years the indebtedness of college students has been growing constatly as well as a proportion of college students holding credit cards. There is a significant increase of median student debt levels from freshman to senior years. It rises from $901 for freshman year to $2,185 with average $1508 for freshmen and $3,262 for seniors with indicates high skewedness at tails of distribution.  At the same time student financial literacy is deteriorating: high school seniors scores on financial literacy test continue to decline over the last five years. 
The article gives a reference to a court testimony by Robert Manning with more intersting facts. He concludes the testimony by citing the fact that there was a 51 % increase of the bankrupcy filers under the age of 25  over the period from 1990-1999.

<TD ALIGN=left>A December 18th article in the New York Times reported that the antimissile interceptors had a very high success rate of 88%, according to Leiutenant General Ronald T. Kadish of the Air Force, who leads the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency. His data was based on 25 tests, which included both long-range and short-range interceptors. The article quotes General Kadish as commenting on the end-game success of the missiles. However,
in an issue of Arms Control Today, the authors commented that the endgame success rate of the missiles is irrelevant since the overall success rate is more pertinent since quality control errors may have occurred during any phase of the tests, thereby misrepresenting General Kadish's conclusion of an 88% success rate.  If overall success rate is measured, rather than endgame success rate, the overall success rate for midcourse systems drops to only 41 percent.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>A recent study has found that people with shorter telomeres, snippets of genetic materials that cap chromosomes, are more likely to die than others of the same age. The study involved 143 people, aging between 60 and 97, who donated their blood during the 1980s. The study noted which people developed fatal diseases afterwards and analyzed the number of victims. Apparently, people with shorter telomeres are three times as likely to die due to heart disease than those with longer telomeres. The former is also seven times more exposed to infectious disease-caused death than the latter. The study predicted that the intake of fruit and vegetables can maintain the length of the telomeres, thereby reducing risk of death.</TD>

Intense exercise is defined as any exercise that raises heart rate or breathing frequency and lasts at least 20 minutes. 30% women between 18 and 45 engage in such exercise, as opposed to 35% men of the same age range. While 24% men older than 50 engage in such exercise, only 19% women of the same age do. Possible explanations include: Women have more housework than men, and regard such work as their moderate exercise every week; women also have misunderstanding about intense exercises that it may harm their body, such as hurting their uterous; women also are concerned about their nightly safety, and hence do not tend to work out in the gym at night.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Statisticians count euros and find more than money.
The New York Times, 2 July, 2002, F3
Otto Pohl
<p>
This article discusses two projects related to the study of the distribution and diffusion of euros in EU countries. After January 1, 2002, euros began to circulate throughout Western Europe, regardless of their country of origin (which is indicated on the coins). The amount of euros produced by each country is proportional to the country's share in the European economy - for instance, Germany produces the highest percentage of euros (32.9%), while Finland and Ireland produce the lowest (2.1%). 
<p>
Two research teams, based in Freiburg and Amsterdam, are investigating the process of euro diffusion across European borders. The German group uses a differential equation based approach to model the diffusion process, whereas the Dutch one uses Markov chains. The latter has predicted that in about one year, there will be as many Dutch as non-Dutch coins in the Netherlands, and statistical equilibrium will be reached in 5-7 years. Then, they predict, the distribution of coins of different nationality will be the same in all countries and equal to their overall distribution in Europe.
<p>
How do these scientists collect data in order to make such models and predictions? Well, they have web sites that ask people to simply "empty the contents of their wallets" and report what types of euros they have and how many. The problem with this method is that the researchers do not have control over their sources of data and cannot ensure the randomness of their sample. The Dutch group has also enrolled so-called "Euro-meters," people who regularly report the contents of their wallets. The success of such a strategy depends on how random the initial sample of people is. If it is not random enough, then certain biases may persist. Another strategy of gathering data that has been proposed is to ask students in class projects to get coins from banks and report their national origins. Banks might be a more reliable source of information because of the faster flow of money through them. Ordinary people are sometimes the last to get their wallets full of new coins. On the other hand, however, they are also the first to get hold of foreign coins, which are not coming from the banks. Thus it might be difficult to decide which is a better indicator of the actual monetary distribution.

<TD ALIGN=left>Ebay's success story
<br>
This is an interesting article that discusses the current trend on eBay - More and more sellers!  It sights a variety of interesting auctions that have been done on the sight, including selling a briefcase from a company that a seller was laid off from, an unemployed husband,  and many others.
<br>
The article attributes this rising web market to the decline of the economy.  People are more willing to sell their collectibles that have a large amount of personal meaning than to give up, and get a job flipping burgers at McDonalds. <br>
I think this is an interesting trend.  After having an introduction to microeconomics (I acknowledge this yields a minimal understand of econ, but nonetheless), I was struck by the thought of an equilibrium with the Internet.  If I could extrapolate the information from Econ 1 to the real world, I would say that the prices on eBay will eventually rise, and the prices offline will go down.  I think this is further supported by the increasing number of people who are connected to the internet, and with the recent generations' obsession and talent using the web. 
<br>

We'll see how long that takes...</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>The National Football League Players Association recently conducted a study to determine the average time span of a player's career.  The players union looked at team rosters from 1987 to 1996, about 1647 athletes a year. The results were surprisingly bleak. The average career of an NFL player lasts only 3.3 years. The shortest careers belong to running backs (2.57 years), then wide receivers (2.81) and cornerbacks (2.94). The positions with the longest careers are quarterbacks (4.44) and kickers (4.87). NFL officials believe that short careers are mainly the result of frequent high-impact collisions and the data seems to support this conclusion.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>The article discusses a 10-year study of nearly 72,000 female nurses that found that getting too little or too much sleep may increase a woman's chances of developing heart disease.  Those who slept five hours or less per night had a 39 percent greater chance of heart disease than those women who got the optimal eight hours, while those getting six hours of sleep had an 18 percent greater risk.  Those women sleeping nine hours or more faced a 37 percent greater risk of heart disease, although the only explanation the researchers could provide for this figure was that these women slept longer due to underlying illnesses.  The article states that past findings support the possibility that the same relationship exists between sleep and heart disease for men.  The study's findings in this case, however, likely include great amounts of error, since the hours of sleep were based on the nurses' own personal recollections, not on direct observation.  The article does not state whether the researchers did anything to account for the higher stress that some hospital nurses face; this could be the more direct cause of heart disease in some of the cases.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>School League Tables:

In England, they give their school children tests to evaluate the strength of the teaching practices at the school and use this to attract more gifted or less gifted students for their programs.  They present these test results in propaganda for the school, but they do not present ample evidence that the results are from the teaching practices themselves.  Many factors are not taken into account, and there is not a control group.  For instance, average family income is not taken into account, nor is where the child's family lives, or the education level of the parents, etc.  These factors have significant effects on the education potential of the students, and intelligence may even be genetic, so without a control group these schools do not really have any evidence on which to make a claim.</TD>

This article lists various statistics related to youths drinking in texas.  I assume that all of the statistics are supposed to show that drinking in Texas is a major problem, but maybe of the statistics have no correlation, such as 63% of youth deaths in car crashes is because they were not wearing seat belts; underage drinking costs the US $53 billion/year; a $50 keg costs only 30 cents a serving; and 74% of high school seniors have tried alcohol.  By listing these statistics together, the website makes it seem that they are related, which may or may not be the case.  Other statistics are strong but vague statements, such as alcohol is the #1 youth drug problem, and minimum drinking age laws have saved 18,220 lives since 1975. It would be interesting to find the formulas they use to derive these numbers.  It would also be interesting to compare these statistics with paralell ones of DArtmouth students.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>During the past several years, research has shown that the general population demonstrates a negative bias toward the elderly.  This prejudice was found to be even greater that negative biases or certain races.  These studies have included over 10,000 subjects who were exposed to a novel test that showed a series of either names or faces in rapid succession.  Subsequently, subjects were given the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to evaluate biases.  Over 80% of old faces were associated with "failure" or "agony."  Since these results have been replicated many times, it seems as if this is a valid finding</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>A Canadian study reported in the "New England Journal of Medicine" found that switching to daylight savings time briefly increased highway accidents, presumably because drivers had lost an hour of sleep. Researchers looked at data for all highway wrecks in Canada for the period around the time change in 1991 and 1992. The Monday immediately after the time change had 7 to 8 percent more accidents than the Mondays a week before or a week later. 

Since clocks are changed Saturday night/Sunday morning, I wonder if there is any change in accidents on the Sunday after daylight savings time, and if there are also more accidents during the entire week after daylight savings time. Also, if people are used to driving at certain times of day, accidents might temporarily increase because of changed driving conditions.</TD>

A Haitian man has more than doubled the 53 year life expectancy for his nation.  The twice-widowed 107 year old man has 20 children, who gave him 185 grandchildren, great grandchildren, and great-great grandchildren.  107 seems quite impressive already, but when it is taken into consideration that he did it in a country with one of the lowest life-expectancy rates in the world and one that has more than 15 times the infant mortality rate as Canada (Haiti has 80/1000), one can see that he has truly overcome the odds.  

I wonder what his failure rate distribution would be.  Seems memoryless to me...     </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Researchers at Harvard University's Civil Rights Project have found that public schools have become more segregated.  They cite several statistics showing that minorities such as blacks and hispanics are now attending school where their respective percentages of the student body are decreasing.  And, that there is a growing trend for these minority groups to attend schools that are composed of more than 90% minorities.  The researchers are finding that these two extremes are becoming more common.

<P>

However, no real answers are posed.  These researchers have found an interesting trend, but have not fully investigated why this trend is happening.  It is suggested that white students are opting for private schools, and this is leaving more minorities within the public school system; this could be one reason.  But additionally, are the demographics changing drastically?  Are students being allowed to choose the public schools they attend?  These researchers need to probe the underlying reasons before they claim "resegregation."</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Health conscious eaters around the world took alert last year when researchers discovered that acrylamide, a substance known to cause cancer in animals, forms in fries, potato chips and other high-carbohydrate foods cooked at high temperatures. 

<P>

However, cross-country report by the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts finds no statistically significant link between acrylamide and an increased risk in the large bowel, bladder or kidney cancers.  The researchers compared the diets of 987 cancer patients and 538 healthy people, who listed their food habits for an unrelated study four years ago. The samples surveyed listed how often they ate 188 different types of food, including some that contain high or medium levels of acrylamide, such as french fries, bread and biscuits.  The study concluded no increased cancer risk among people who consumed high levels of acrylamide-rich food products. 

<P>

While the study reliably samples a large sample size, the data was from 1999 questionaires distributed for an entirely different purpose.  Another critic, Michael F. Jacobsen, executive director of Washington-based health advocacy group, said the cancers the study focused on weren't the types shown to cause cancer in animals. He said acrylamide was found to cause lung, breast and uterus cancers in animal testing.  So although this study seems to refute the claim that fast food may cause cancer, you should still think twice about ordering that extra-value meal.

<TD ALIGN=left>I work in the office of Evaluation and Research here at Dartmouth.  One of the surveys we run is administered to freshmen upon entering college.  It asks entering students  about many of their habits in high school, their political views, what they expect from college, etc.  This survey has been run by the Higher Education Research Institute for at least 40 years, and when the results for each year come out in mid-winter, highlights get picked up by the national news media.

This year was no exception, and a series of articles have been written on the survey.  One of the articles is the one cited above.  In the article, they mention that this year's freshmen class had an all-time low of 46.5% of students reporting that they drank beer either "frequently" or "occasionally" in high school.  They then go on to say that the all-time high, 73.7%, occurred in 1982.  

While this is a striking comparison, I do not believe it is one that should be made.  In 1982, the legal drinking age in most (if not all) states was 18.  The National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which forced states to raise their drinking ages to 21 or lose federal highway funding, was not signed into law in June 1984.  I do not believe any drinking statistics before this date, or even a few years after, can really be compared to today.  It's not surprising at all that a significantly higher percentage of entering freshmen reported drinking alcohol in high school in the early 1980's--it was legal!</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Kids Grow Older Faster <BR>

To date, an average american girl between 3 and 11 years old owns 10 Barbie dolls, an Italian or British girl owns seven, a German or French girl owns 5 Barbie dolls. However,   despite the fact of being American sweetheart and having the second largest after Wall Street Journal  and just behind Armani empire, Barbie doll is loosing its market share. Last year the company sales dropped by 3%: this is attributed to a phenomenon known as "age compression" or "KGOY" kids getting older younger. Girls now grow out of traditional playing patterns earlier than they used to do in the past. There was a time when a 12 year old girl might still be playing with Barbie. Today the prime audience of Barbie doll is 3 to 5 years old.

<TD ALIGN=left>   This CNN article goes through various findings from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, comparing changes in America's wealth since 1998.  Comparisons are made between 1998 and 2001, and different statistics are computed for different economic groups.  The article concludes that people as a whole are richer, and that the wealthiest Americans have seen the greatest increases in wealth.
<BR>
Some relevant statistics compare net worths of individuals.  For the top 10%, median net worth has increased 69.3%.  For the bottom 20%, median net worth increased by 25.4%.  Noticing that the median family income rose 9.6%, compared to the mean family income rising 17.4%, gives more evidence of the increasing wealth inequalities.

<BR> 
The article is interesting because every income comparison shows that wealth inequalities have been increasing dramatically.   These findings are especially relevant in light of Bush's new tax plan which gives more tax breaks to these wealthier Americans.  It would also be interesting to compare these findings with the changes in quality of life over the same time period.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>After seeing Bowling for Columbine over break, it got me thinking about gun control.  Director Michael Moore ponders the possible correlations to youth gun violence in America.  He examines the following in relation with the events: the availability of guns, violent movies and music, video games, and poor parenting.  In the movie itself, he doesn’t come to a conclusion (don’t worry, this doesn’t ruin the movie).  

In order to quantify at least a portion of the film, I went to the Chance website, and found an article on gun control posted in 1998 (a few months before the Columbine incident).  The study focuses on Economist John Lott’s book, “More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun Control Laws.”  As the title suggests, Lott’s book suggests that if more people are prepared for violence, less violence will occur.  The book itself states that his book includes "the most rigorously comprehensive data analysis ever done on crime".

Part of the controversy of comes from Lott’s theory that more guns does <i>not</i> necessarily mean more accidents.  He debunks previous studies linking households with guns to homicides by saying that saying the two are related is not possible.  This is a large problem with statistics.  You can state that two things are related, but you cannot make a causal statement as to what causes what.  He likened the study of deaths related to home firearms to a study linking people visiting hospitals to people dying.  

This is a very controversial theory, but it can be further researched at the chance website.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This article discusses a health study that found that the number of fatal car crashes increases by about 41 percent in the four hours following the Super Bowl, as compared to those hours on the Sundays before and after the Super Bowl, when the weather and conditions should be roughly the same.  Nonfatal car crashes also increased by 46 percent.  These increases represent 7 additional deaths and 600 additional injuries than on the adjacent Sundays.  The study based these findings on crash data from the last 27 Super Bowls.  The researchers also found that the surge in crashes was greatest in the losing team's state, where there is a 68 percent increase, compared to the 6 percent increase in the winning team's state.  The researchers theorized that this increase is not simply caused by alcohol and the late hour following the game, but also that the losing team's fans are distracted as they replay moments from the game in their heads, wishing they had gone differently.  It seems as if the winning team's fans should also be distracted as they replay positive memories from the game in their minds, but this does not seem to be the case.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>One of the things I noticed when I came back to Dartmouth this year was that the signs saying "The majority of Dartmouth students have 0, 1, 2, 3, or at most 4 drinks when they party" had been replaced. The new signs read "7 out of 10 Dartmouth students have at most 4 drinks when they party." It's interesting that according to these statistics it might also be true that the majority of Dartmouth students have 4 or MORE drinks when they party, but what I really wonder about is how reliable these numbers are. No poll is answered by every Dartmouth student. What are the drinking habits of the people who don't answer as compared to the people who do? Are people less likely to respond to the poll because they're heavy drinkers? Can the drinking habits of all Dartmouth students be ascertained realistically from this self-selecting subgroup? Also, what is the goal of the organization or committee that analyzed this data?</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>It has been reported that there is a 10-20% shortage of nurses in hospitals nationwide.  As a result, the available nurses are required to increase the number of patients that they attend to.  This increased workload has lead nurses for decades to claim that their increase in professional responsibilities is dangerous for patients.  To test this claim, the University of Pennsylvania conducted a study that observed the relationship between nurses’ workloads and patient outcomes.  10,184 nurses in the state of Pennsylvania were surveyed about patient mortality and/or serious complications after surgery.  The results of the study indicated that adding an extra patient to a nurse’s workload is associated with a 7% increased risk of mortality.
	One criticism about this study is that the methodology seems inherently flawed.  Only about 50% of the nurses responded to the survey.  In all likelihood, the nurses who were most likely to return the surveys were those most concerned with their workload.  In addition, the shortage of nurses was reported as a national problem.  However, the study only looked at Pennsylvania hospitals.  The effectiveness of health care and the rates of certain diseases differ in various regions of the nation.  Therefore, the fact that data was collected in Pennsylvania may act as a confound in this study.

<TD ALIGN=left>David Galenson of the University of Chicago recently published a statistical analysis of creativity in avant-garde paintings.  Using regression analysis, Galenson identified two types of creativity: 'conceptual' and 'experimental.' The distinction is that experimentalists change their techniques gradually over time while conceptualists innovate in sudden leaps. Galenson modeled creativity and innovation as 'goods' for which the artist received recognition and praise as 'compensation.' Using these techniques he determined that experimentalists usually produce their most renowned work near the end of their careers while conceptualists produce highly-valued work earlier. Not surprisingly, Galenson's attempt to mesh statistics and painting was not appreciated by most members of the art community.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This article was very interesting because it points out the methods the media uses to make tragedies sound more catastrophic.  For example, for the fires in the west, they will use calculations of how much land was burned to make the event sound much more drastic, therefore selling more stories.  They make tragedies, such as air rage and horrible accidents, sound much more likely then they actually are.  They instill fear into the reader so the reader will want to continue buying the periodical to learn how to guard against these events, when the real guard they have against the events are the high probabilities they will not be the one caught in that situation.  </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Dr. Richard Wiseman, a British researcher, created a web site called LaughLab, which was dedicated to the study of humor. Its main goal was to investigate how people of different ages, genders, and nationalities responded to different types of humor - what kinds of jokes they considered to be the funniest, etc. Dr. Wiseman managed to collect 40,000 jokes and 2 million ratings. He analyzed this data and published his findings in a book called LaughLab: The Scientific Search for the World's Funniest Jokes, which was expected to come out in December 2002. 
<p>
The top three jokes are cited in the article. Personally, I don't find the first one particularly funny or original (maybe there's something specific in it that I am missing). The second one, though, is hilarious! Apparently, there is something highly individual about humor - not all people would laugh even at the "funniest joke in the world." 
<p>
The end of the article gives a ranking of ten countries according to how funny people from those countries found the jokes on the web site. The ten countries considered were the ones that posted the highest numbers of jokes on the web site. What strikes me about these rankings is that all ten countries are Western countries and six of them are English-speaking countries. I suspect that this study suffers from a certain linguistic bias. Since it was conducted in English, people from English-speaking countries were more likely to respond to it, and to appreciate the jokes posted on the web site, which came primarily from English-speaking cultures similar to their own. Thus the study does not provide a global perspective on humor, but rather a Western and Anglophone one. Do people from other countries laugh less or have fewer jokes than, say, the British or Americans? I doubt it.

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>Walking into a dorm at Dartmouth is a sure-fire way to learn just exactly how many people share your problems.  Look at any residential area's bulletin board and you will certainly see countless stats about who you are, how you fit into the population, and how you should act.  The signs tell us how many people are abused, how many people have addictions, how many drinks "normal people" have, anything you ever wanted to know.  The newest signs that have caught my attention are from the Men's project.  They share with us all sorts of disturbing, but often vague, information:  less than 44% of undergraduates are men, 70% of alcoholics are men, 80% of suicides are committed by men.  Signs like this always catch my attention because I'm wondering about their validity.  And in the case of many, my suspicions are warranted.  For instance, to say that 70% of alcoholics are men is a bold claim that may create assumptions in those who don't ask questions.  What exactly does this mean?  70% of diagnosed alcoholics are men?  70% of alcoholics who receive treatment are men?  An estimated 70% of all alcoholics are men?  All of these formulations are different and tell radically different stories.  I would argue that in one respect, to post a claim like this with no further information is unfair and misleading.  Nevertheless, perhaps the goal of such signs is less to disseminate information and more to pique interest and force further research.  Such is the psychology of statistics I guess - some will blindly accept and some will question.  Perhaps the overriding goal is to get both groups to explore deeper.

<TD ALIGN=left>An ambitious study followed about 1 million children for a decade to find a correlation between living with a single parent and devloping problems later in life.

The scientists found that children with single parents were twice as likely as the others to develop a psychiatric illness such as severe depression or schizophrenia, to kill themselves or attempt suicide, and to develop an alcohol-related disease. 

Girls were three times more likely to become drug addicts if they lived with a sole parent, and boys were four times more likely. 

Economic status was also analyzed, but there is debate whether finances have a large influence.  The study also suggests that quality of parenting is an issue when considering future quality of life.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Flu Deaths

On Wednesday, June 8, USA Today reported on a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association about the average number of deaths caused by Influenza and a related virus every year in the U.S.  According to the study, an average of 47,000 people die of the flu and related diseases each year.  Previously, experts believed that the flu killed an average of 20,000 people a year, but this new study concludes that the number is closer to 36,000, with 11,000 other deaths resulting from a related virus called RSV.  However, there is a large variance in the number of deaths over the years, with some years seeing as many as 70,000 flu deaths.  Another finding of the study is that those most affected are people 65 or older, making up 90% of all flu deaths, and 78% of RSV deaths.  RSV was originally thought to primarily affect children.  Experts are concluding that with the growth in the number of old people, the flu could cause many more deaths.  According to one of these experts, “''Simple demographics practically ensure an impending public health disaster.''

<TD ALIGN=left>Article title: "Restricting R-movies linked to decreased teen smoking, drinking."
<P>
This article is a summary of a study performed by researchers at the Norris Cotton Cancer Center at DHMC, DMS, and Dartmouth College.  These researchers, who surveyed about 4500 students in grades five through eight in NH and VT, found that children who are not restricted by their parents from watching R-rated movies are "three times more likely to smoke or drink alcohol compared to those who are never allowed to watch them."  Specifically, researchers found that 30% and 46% of unrestricted children had tried smoking and drinking, respectively, whereas only two and four percent (respectively) of children whose parents restricted them from viewing R-movies had tried the two substances.
<P>
Madeline Dalton, the lead author on the paper, is quoted as saying "This study clearly shows that adolescents are much more likely to smoke or drink if their parents let them watch R-rated movies."  This I do not doubt.  However, I do take issue with is the alternate interpretation of the findings given in the report.  The author of thisnews report misinterpreted the findings of the study as "a new strategy for parents who don't want their children to smoke or drink; don't let them watch R-rated movies."  This is not what the study was saying at all.  What was reported(I am assuming; I didn't read the original study), was probably a correlation between watching R-rated movies and smoking/drinking behavior.  This, as we all know, does not imply causation.
<P>
That being said, however, the difference in smoking/drinking behaviors between the restricted and unrestricted groups <B>is</B> particularly striking.  Especially given the fact that 90% of the students surveyed were under age 14, and only 16% said they were not allowed to watch R-rated movies.  Additionally, smoking/drinking behaviors were not associated with other measures of parental strictness.
<P>
It's definitely something to chew on.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>The proportion of children living in single-parent homes more than doubled between 1970 and 1998—from 12% to 28%.In 1998, about 3 in 10 children lived in single-parent homes. Furthermore, a never-married parent is becoming more common in single-parent homes. Between 1970 and 1998, there was a five-fold increase in the proportion of children living with a never-married parent. 

These figures may have significant implications for trends in everything from education levels and future opportunitites to juvenile crime figures. The study documents that 4 in 10 children living with only one parent lived below the poverty level in 1998, compared to 1 in 10 children living with both parents. It would be interesting if these figures can be related to an increase in juvenile crime between the mid-eighties and the mid-nineties. Establishing any such relationship would have major policy implications at both the national and local level. </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Well the Australian open is grinding down to an exciting finish.  On the men's side, number 2 seed Andre Agassi has clinched the final and fellow American number 9 seed Andy Roddick looks to join him there.  On the women's side, no surprises at all as the top two seeds, American sisters Venus and Serena, have reached the final of the fourth consecutive grand slam.  Last week, I examined how the men's tour seeds players in draws in order to prevent top players from meeting early on.  Lets shift to the women.

<P>

In this year's Australian Open, the men's draw takes on the form of 1 / 30 / 18 / 15 ... 9 /19 / 25 / 7 ... 3 / 31 / 23 / 13 ... 10 / 20 / 32 / 6 ... 5 / 26 / 17 / 11 ... 16 / 21 / 28/ 4 ... 8 / 27 / 24/ 12 ... 14 / 22 / 29 / 2 ... 


<P>

The women's draw takes on the form of 1 / 26 / 18 / 16 ... 11 / 20 / 25 / 6 ... 4 / 29 / 19 / 14 ... 10 / 17 / 28 / 8 ... 5 / 32 / 24 / 9 ... 15 / 22 / 30 / 3 ... 7 / 31 / 21 / 12 ... 13 / 23 / 27 / 2.  

<P>

It is evident that the men's draw is a little bit more rigidly structured than the women's draw.  The women's top seed has a 25% chance of meeting seeds #5-8 in the quarterfinals (as opposed to men's top seed having a 50% chance of meeting seeds #7-8), a 12.5% chance of meeting seeds #9-16 in the round of 16 (as opposed to men's top seed having a 25% chance of meeting seeds #13-16).  In the round of 32, the format is the same as that of the men: seeds #1-8 each have a 12.5 % chance of meeting seeds #25-32 while seeds 9-16 each have a 12.5 % chance of meeting seeds #17-24.  The women will have more exciting matchups in the quarterfinals and round of 16 because of the greater possibilities for possible match-ups.  This creates more interest in the women's game and I strongly think that the men should change their draw policy.  In fact, why not make it even less rigid?  How about seeds #1-16 each having a 1/16 probability of meeting seeds #17-32 in the round of 32?   </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>The article, "Get up and get moving," explains that moderate exercise is better than none at all.  It makes the connection that thirty minutes of exercise per day reduces the incidence of heart disease.  The very end of the article cites an interesting finding from a Stanford study of more than 6,000 men.  This study found that "tolerance for exercise (tested on a treadmill) was a stronger predictor of risk of death than high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol and heart disease."  If we believe that exercising is indeed a way to stay healthy and live longer and that people with a higher tolerance for exercise are more likely to exercise more frequently than those with a lower tolerance, then this claim can make sense.  The article, however, leaves these connections for the reader to draw on his own.
<P>
The last study cited in the article is meant to draw the article to a close.  It says, "And, finally, in the study of 73,743 women, just sitting for longer periods of time predicted an increased risk of cardiovascular disease."  My first thought that came to mind after reading this was, "I wonder if the amount of time spent exercising is a better indicator."  It seems logical that the time spent sitting is inversely related to amount of time spent exercising, but it is unlikely that these two variables are perfectly correlated.  In my mind, it seems more appropriate to link lack of exercise to higher incidence of heart disease, rather than trying to imply a causal relationship with sitting for long periods of time to heart disease.</TD>

For example for Belgian euro test statistics for 250 spins was 140 heads, while for German Euro for 100 spins it was 54 heads.  </TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>This article discusses a study recently completed by the University of Maryland that found that the state of Maryland's application of the death penalty contains large racial and geographic disparities.  The study, similar to several others conducted in recent years in other states, specifically found that Maryland prosecutors are twice as likely to pursue the death penalty for black defendants who kill white victims than for black defendants who kill black victims.  The study also found evidence that there is a huge discrepancy in the application of the death penalty between different jurisdictions; for instance, Baltimore County is 26 times as likely to pursue the penalty than is Baltimore City.

However, while the evidence is supported by studies in other states, it is not clear how accurate these particular researchers' conclusions are from the article.  For one thing, the emphasis on racial disparity, over the geographic disparity that was also found, may be motivated by the fact that the new Republican governor of Maryland is publicly discussing lifting the moratorium on the death penalty implemented by the previous Democratic governor; racial disparity is more likely to raise political uproar.    Therefore, it is difficult to determine from the article whether the black suspects are less likely to be prosecuted for killing black victims because of racial bias or because the vast majority of black victims are killed in Baltimore City and Prince George's County, two areas where prosecutors rarely seek the death penalty.  The article is also not specific about the variables controlled by the researchers, raising the question of the importance of the economic status of the suspect and the victim (or the difference between the two) in the application of the death penalty.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Adam Lawrence of the University of Pittsburgh recently presented his findings about the president's ability to affect the national agenda. He conducted his research by cataloging the issues raised in State of the Union addresses between 1946 and 2002 and comparing them to the results of Gallup polls, which regularly ask respondents to name the most important problem facing the United States. Lawrence's analysis determined that every 50 words devoted to an issue in the address resulted in a 1.5 percentage point increase in the number of people ranking that issue as the nation's most significant problem. Even more interestingly, every 50 words taking credit for solving a problem translated into a 6 percentage point decrease in the number of citizens viewing it as the biggest problem.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>According to this study, resumes with "white-sounding names" such as "Neil, Brett, Greg, Emily, Anne and Jill" received more responses from employers than those with "black-sounding names" such as "Tamika, Ebony, Aisha, Rasheed, Kareem and Tyrone."  5000 resumes were sent in response to various job ads in The Boston Globe and Chicago Tribune and on average "white" resumes received one response per 10 resumes, whereas "black" resumes received one response per 15.  The article does not mention various possibilities for this discrepancy.  It could be that many employers prefer white workers regardless of their credentials or that "black-sounding names" or perhaps "ghetto-sounding names" signal inferior job performance or higher risk to employers, especially those in urban settings.  It could also be due to a bias in the study or a statistical fluke.  In my opinion, studies like this have a hard time being judged objectively, because each possible interpretation is somewhat politically loaded.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>  The article discusses how safe skiing is.  It uses suspicious statistics to prove that it is not dangerous, and has not become more dangerous than in the past.  First, it compares skiing to traveling and concludes that skiing is safer because its fatality rate is 0.15 deaths/million hours of exposure while traveling's rate is 0.5 deaths/million hours.  Then the article discusses whether skiing has become more dangerous than in the past.  In 1997, 121, 800 skiiers and snowboarders were treated in emergency rooms.  In 1993, 127, 000 people were treated.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>"Study links workloads of nurses to patient risk"
<P>
This Boston Globe article is about a study published by University of Pennsylvania researchers in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which is intended to show that increased workloads of nurses due to understaffing of US hospitals lead to higher risks of patient mortality and serious medical complications. There are two statements in the article that arouse suspicion. 
<P>
First, the article says that the response rate to the survey, conducted among nurses in Pennsylvania, was about 50%. In my opinion, this relatively low response rate casts some doubt on the accuracy of the findings, because nurses who are overloaded with work are more likely to respond to such a survey in order to voice their concerns, especially if they feel that patient safety is being compromised at their hospital or if they have had a case of patient death due to the nursing shortage. 
<P>
Second, the author of the article claims that "analysis of (the collected) data showed that adding an extra surgical patient to a nurse's load was associated with a 7% increase in mortality risk". As this figure is presented in the article, it is unclear whether it refers to an absolute increase of 7 deaths per 100 patients, or to an increase of 7% relative to the mortality that occurs without an extra patient. The first interpretation seems unlikely given the following data from the last paragraph of the JAMA publication: "when nurses were caring for six patients instead of four, there were an additional 2.3 deaths per 1,000 patients; for patients with complications, there were an extra 8.7 deaths per 1,000. When nurses handled eight patients instead of four, there were 18.2 extra deaths per 1,000 patients with complications." One can see from these data that adding TWO more surgical patients with complications to a nurse’s workload results in an increase in mortality of about 1%. Thus adding one patient cannot increase mortality by 7%. Therefore, the 7% increase to which the Boston Globe journalist refers is most likely a relative increase in mortality rather than an absolute one. However, the data just mentioned are not quoted in the article, and readers of the Boston Globe are likely to be misled by this figure.

<TD ALIGN=left>As tennis' first Grand Slam of the even heats up down under this week, I thought it would be interesting to examine the draw - making policy on the men and women's tours.  In Grand Slam events (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open), the draw consists of 128 players, of whom the top 32 are seeded.  The seeded players are then placed in certain positions within the draw, while the non-seeded players fill in the gaps.  

<P>

In this year's Australian Open, the men's draw takes on the form of 1 / 30 / 18 / 15 ... 9 / 19 / 25 / 7 ... 3 / 31 / 23 / 13 ... 10 / 20 / 32 / 6 ... 5 / 26 / 17 / 11 ... 16 / 21 / 28 / 4 ... 8 / 27 / 24/ 12 ... 14 / 22 / 29 / 2 ... 

<P>

In any tournament draw, it is guaranteed that the top two seeds will be on opposite sides of the draw and will not meet until the finals.  In a fair draw, seed 1 meets 2 in the final, meets 4 in the semifinals, meets 8 in the quarterfinals, meets 16 in the round of 16 etc.  In other words, in a round with n teams / players, the match up should always consist of players / teams with a combined seeding of n+1.  In fact, this is the way that the NCAA March Madness tournament is set up.  There is no uncertainty in which seed will face which seed.  However, the mens tour does not make a straight up flat draw.  

<P>

The rules of making draws on the men's tour stipulates that that the top seed and 2nd seed each have a 50% chance of meeting #3 in the semifinals and a 50% chance of meeting #4.  In the quarterfinals, they each have a 50% chance of meeting #7 and a 50% chance of meeting #8 while #3 and #4 each have a 50% chance of meeting #5 and #6.  In the round of 16, the top seed four seeds each have a 25 % chance of meeting seeds 13-16 while seeds #5-8 each have a 25% chance of meeting seeds 9-12.  In the round of 32, seeds 1-8 each have a 12.5 % chance of meeting seeds 25-32 while seeds 9-16 each have a 12.5 % chance of meeting seeds 17-24.  Keep in mind that these are only potential match-ups and will only happen if the higher seeded player beats lower seeded players on the way to the final.  However, it is interesting to see the way in which the men's tour makes draws and the rules they set in order to keep match-ups interesting.  Next week I will discuss the women's tour's rules and how they differ from the men's tour.

<TR>
<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>If Money Magazine published it, it must be true-- Austin, Charlotte, Chicago, Denver, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Seattle have officially been declared this year's Best Places to Live.
<p>
How were these places picked?  They were chosen, ostensibly, by our fellow Americans.  Money magazine decided that "the best way to understand what Americans really care about when deciding where to live was to look at how they've already voted with their feet--and their wallets."  In this vein, they limited their list of eligable cities to the 57 cities with populations above 300,000.  They then ranked the cities by rate of population growth since 1990.  Next, they compared the average 2002 home sale in each city to the median income of the city residents, creating what they call a "housing-premium ratio."  The bigger the gap between home prices and income, the higher a city ranked--supposedly, if people are willing to pay more to live in a city, there must be "something about it" that justifies the extra expenditure.  These two numbers were combined to create a "Money Popularity Ranking," which, as its name implies, ranked the 57 large cities in order of most popular to least.
<p>
 But this is where the idea gets a bit fuzzy.  Money magazine says, "A top popularity score alone wasn't enough to make our final list of 10 top towns."  They give an example of Honolulu, which had a high score on the popularity rankings, yet didn't make the cut.  The justification?  "Its far-flung location and tourism-based economy limit its appeal as a full-time residence."  Isn't this a bit subjective?  Maybe the wind in Chicago also limits its appeal as a full-time residence.  Or the rain in Seattle.  Or maybe a large city isn't the Best Place to live to begin with; i'm sure many small-towners would never live in a city.  Thus, while it is nice to have an idea of some of the more attractive cities in the US, to headline them as the Best Places to Live may be going a little far.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>The findings in the Torah and Moby Dick predicting the assassinations of multiple world leaders, the tragedy of September 11th, and the nuclear apocalypse in 2006 do not present strong evidence that they could predict these events.  Considering that there are only 26 letters in the alphabet and that most of the words that were used as evidence were whole words already included in the story.   For the remainder of the words spaced out with equal letters in between, this is not that unlikely.  Considering that there are 300,000 letters in the Torah, it is very likely the desired word patterns can be found somewhere.  The vertical words formed can be manipulated by deciding on different amounts of letters in pages.  Therefore, all evidence presented in the Bible Codes is speculative and cannot be taken into account.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>Professor Annamaria Lusardi wrote an article entitled “Explaining Why So Many Households Do Not Save,” which reveals some discouraging statistics about the generation that is approaching retirement.  Many adults are far from prepared, for approximately 1/3 of the respondents from her data set have “hardly thought” about retirement.  In terms of wealth, a quarter of households nearing retirement have less than $30,000 in total net worth.  This would only buy an annuity of around $2,200 a year.  Also, 15% of households do not hold ANY of the conventional financial assets (checking and savings accounts, CDs, Tbills, bonds, stocks, IRAs, etc.), and more than 50% of the families do not hold any stocks or IRAs.  In one survey, approximately 3/4 of workers close to retiring have little idea regarding how much money they need to accumulate for retirement.  This could cause many problems in the future.  </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>The article, "Exercise rights--and wrongs," discusses the benefits of exercise.  It's a typical health article, but I found their activity comparison to be the most interesting portion.  Apparently, the following activities all provide similar benefits:
<P>
11 min. Jumping rope <BR>
13 min. Jogging (10 min/hour) <BR>
19 min. Swimming <BR>
24 min. Moderate cycling <BR>
27 min. Tennis (doubles) <BR>
30 min. Walking (15 min/hour) <BR>
30 min. Mowing the lawn
<P>
Wait, what?  30 minutes of walking (at the snail pace of 15-minutes-per-mile) provides similar benefits as 30 minutes of mowing the lawn?  I don't really see how these two activities are comparable since mowing the lawn is essentially walking--probably also at the snail pace of 15-minutes-per-mile--plus pushing a lawnmower around.  I have an issue with this.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>In an article published on the ABC website, reporter Robert Kulwich poses the following question: when will the population of Italy reach zero? Professor Charles Grinstead of Swarthmore College estimates that it will take approximately 1000 years for the population of Italy to reach zero. 
<p>
The current population of Italy is 57 million and, on average, each Italian woman gives birth to 1.2 children. The assumptions of the problem are that the average age of women at the time they give birth is 30, women stop having children at age 46 and 50% of babies are female. We further assume that there is no immigration or emigration. To approach the problem we note that any woman in the future can be traced back to a woman alive today, by restricting the ancestry to only go through women. Thus, we can consider how many women alive at time x have as an ancestor a women alive today, and then multiply this number by the number of child-bearing women alive today. Given a particular woman alive today, in 30 years she is replaced by 0.6 women:
<p>
	F(30) = 0.6 and F(30n) = (0.6)^n
	<p>
Hence the number of women alive at time x who can be traced back to one woman alive today is
	F(x) = (0.6)^(x/30).
<p>
If there are W women under age 46 in the current population, then at time x there will be a total of W*F(x) women. 
<p>
A rough estimate of the number of women in Italy under 46 is W=20 million.
Setting W*F(x) = 1, we obtain x = 987 years. Thus in 987 years, there would be only one woman of childbearing age in Italy! 
<p>
(Note: demographer Karl Haub of the Population Reference Bureau estimated through different means that Italy would, under the same conditions, reach a population of 0 in 2000 years)</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Euro NCAP is a company that assesses the safety of vehicles in crashes.  In the study that I found on the internet (http://www.euroncap.com/research/swedish_study.doc) the mathematicians seek to find a correlation to the results from the Euro NCAP (which were in a lab setting) and injury data from car crashes on the streets.  
<p>
The paper uses standard deviation in addition to correlation tables to back up the claims. The researchers also took into account various physical laws and equations to assess the different impact imparted by larger vehicles, and vehicles traveling at different speeds.  
<p>
It turns out that cars with 3 or 4 stars from the Euro NCAP are 30% safer than those with one or two stars (and the non-rated cars).

<TD ALIGN=left>Summary of article:
<br>
Two columnists tell the following story: A Utah inspector tells a local Café’s manager that since one of four eggs carries Salmonella bacterium, a quiche should made from at most three eggs. The manager wonders if the risk of harm could be reduced if he randomly throws out three eggs out of a dozen and makes four-egg quiches from the remaining. The inspector is not sure and says he will do research on this. This is the end of story. Unbelieving readers later verify that the inspector never hears the manager’s proposed solution and definitely never agrees to research further. As a matter of fact, the Utah law prohibits the pooling of more than three eggs, a mechanism that puts eggs in a large container after breaking them.

<br>
<p>
Commentary:
<br>
First, let’s look at the validity of the Utah regulation. Suppose that a four-egg quiche is harmful if at lease one of the eggs is SE-positive, and suppose the report is accurate in that one out of four eggs is SE-positive. Then the probability that a random egg is not SE-positive is _. Hence the probability of a four-egg quiche being harmful is 1-( _ )^4 = 68.4%, and that of a three-egg quiche being harmful is 1-( _ )^3 = 57.8%. The regulation prohibits four-egg quiches so as to reduce the risks of harms. However, the café’s manager’s solution does not help at all. The truth is that, no matter the number of eggs randomly disposed of, each egg still carries _ probability of being SE-positive; and four-egg quiches would still have a 68.4% chance of harm. Therefore, the proposed solution would not reduce the risk at all.

<TD ALIGN=left>If we observe a “lineup” of three pennies, two fair and one with a 75% chance of heads, the chance of guessing which coin is unfair is 1/3. But suppose we had witnessed three tosses with one of these pennies and it had come up heads each time. If we now guess that this penny is the unfair one, according to Bayes’ Rule we have a 63% chance of being correct:
<p>
Say A is the event that three heads are thrown, B0 is the event that a fair coin is used, and B1 is the event that the unfair coin is used. Then from page 19 in our text
<p>
P(B1 | A) = P(A | B1) P(B1) / [ P(A | B0) P(B0) + P(A | B1) P(B1) ]
<p>
and 
<p>
 P(B1 | A) = .63
<p>
Furthermore, when there are five coins in the lineup and we have observed one come up heads three times in a row, the probability is only .46 that this coin is the unfair one. The author of this article, John Allen Paulos, compares these results to police lineups, where he says that "the probability of a correct identification...is frequently as low as 60 percent, and, what's worse, innocents in the lineup are picked up to 20 percent or more of the time..."
<p>
I don’t see the correlation between picking the unfair coin and picking an offender from a police lineup because participants in police lineups all behave in a uniform manner; no one suspect does anything akin to coming up heads three times in a row

<TD ALIGN=left>This article addresses the concern that television violence has a detrimental effect on children.  L. Rowell Huesmann conducted a lengthy study following 329 children from elementary school to their 20's.  He tracked the amount of violent television was watched by each individual and compared it to their levels of agression.  The top 20% of the violent television viewers were designated "heavy watchers".  The results were as follows:

<p>"After controlling for such variables as socioeconomic status and intelligence, the investigators found that the "heavy watchers" had tended to become more aggressive adults. As described in the article, women who had been heavy watchers as children were twice as likely as the other women in the group to have hit or choked another adult in the last year. Men who had been heavy watchers were three times as likely to have been convicted of a crime. Among the women who had married, the heavy watchers were twice as likely to have thrown an object at their spouse in the last year. Among the men who had married, heavy watchers were almost twice as likely to have grabbed or pushed their spouse in the last year."

<p>These are interesting statistics, but I think that they are misleading.  This article implies that violent television leads to actual violence.  However, I believe it's equally valid that those who are more agressive would watch more violent television peaceful individuals simply by preference.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This article concludes that unmarried couples living together have a more equitable division of housework than married couples. One study done by the University of Maryland found that married women spend an average of 18 hours each week on housework, as compared to 10 hours each week for their husbands.  This result is consistent with a number of similar studies conducted over the years.  Another study conducted at the University of California at Irvine concluded that husband who lives with their wives before marriage did 34% of the housework while husband who did not live with their wives before marriage did 30% of the housework.  Finally, another study compared the housework division between 7,000 married and 7,000 unmarried couples.  The results showed that married women did approximately 71% of the housework while unmarried women living with men did 67% of the housework.
	The article raises a number of questions regarding the external validity of these studies.  First of all, it was questioned whether the difference between 71% and 67% in the last study mentioned is a significant finding.  Since such a large sample size was used, I believe that the numerical difference can certainly be considered to be highly statistically significant.  Another question raised is whether or not unmarried couples living together are generally more liberal than couples who do not live together before marriage.  Therefore, it is proposed that unmarried couples living together would also have more liberal views of housework division, thus explaining the difference.  However, a counter-argument was made that unmarried women living with men have been more adeptly trained in cohabitation and continue that pattern during marriage.  The answer to this question seems inconclusive from the information given in the article, but a follow-up longitudinal study could be designed to answer that question.

<TD ALIGN=left>Summary of article: <p><p>
Two columnists tell the following story: A Utah inspector tells a local Café’s manager that since one of four eggs carries Salmonella bacterium, a quiche should made from at most three eggs. The manager wonders if the risk of harm could be reduced if he randomly throws out three eggs out of a dozen and makes four-egg quiches from the remaining. The inspector is not sure and says he will do research on this. This is the end of story. Unbelieving readers later verify that the inspector never hears the manager’s proposed solution and definitely never agrees to research further. As a matter of fact, the Utah law prohibits the pooling of more than three eggs, a mechanism that puts eggs in a large container after breaking them.
<p><p>
Commentary:<p><p>
First, let’s look at the validity of the Utah regulation. Suppose that a four-egg quiche is harmful if at lease one of the eggs is SE-positive, and suppose the report is accurate in that one out of four eggs is SE-positive. Then the probability that a random egg is not SE-positive is ¾. Hence the probability of a four-egg quiche being harmful is 1-( ¾ )^4 = 68.4%, and that of a three-egg quiche being harmful is 1-( ¾ )^3 = 57.8%. The regulation prohibits four-egg quiches so as to reduce the risks of harms. However, the café’s manager’s solution does not help at all. The truth is that, no matter the number of eggs randomly disposed of, each egg still carries ¼ probability of being SE-positive; and four-egg quiches would still have a 68.4% chance of harm. Therefore, the proposed solution would not reduce the risk at all.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>Three University of Pennsylvania economists recently investigated this phenomenon
using two large datasets, Britain's National Child Development Study and America's
National Longitudinal Study for Youth.  As expected, height and earnings were
positively associated. Overall, for white British males, an additional inch of
height was associated with a 1.7% increase in wages; the corresponding advantage
for white American males was 1.8%. In both countries, the shortest quarter of
workers averaged 10% lower earnings than the tallest quarter. 

The intriguing twist in the new study is suggested by the article's subtitle: "Why
it pays to be a lanky teenager?" The researchers discovered that most of the
earnings advantage can be attributed to height at age 16. Differences in height
later in life or in childhood do not add much additional explanatory power. The
researchers proposed social adjustment as a possible explanation. Taller teens may have an easier time participating in athletics and other activities, where they
develop positive self-esteem and social skills that contribute to later success.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>The Tipping Point:  How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference
   by: Malcom Gladwell  

"The tipping point is that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social
behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire."  

        This national bestseller explores the fads and trends of society and
attempts to explain the factors that cause something to really catch on and
become popular.  Gladwell poses examples from all aspects of life:  from the
popularization of Hush Puppies and Sesame Street, to syphilis epidemics, to
Paul Revere's famous midnight ride.  The common theme is that in all of these
we can observe a certain moment when each trend makes a sudden, seemingly
unexplainable, jump.  While his explanations are offered from more of a social
science slant, there are enough statistics to tide over any mathematician.  I
recommend it to anyone who likes to see mathematics applied to the real world not just for natural or scientific phenomena but for social phenomena as well.

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>Michael Drosknin wrote a book called the Bible Codes, which refer to the first five
books of the Bible.  

The Codes combine all the words together into one long string and then arrange it
in rows to find pattern lines 

across or down the rows and columns that form words with equadistant letter
sequences.  Drosknin republished 

the Codes after September 11, claiming that the Bible not only predicted the nature
of the attacks but also 

predicted the US response, which would ultimately escalate to the end of the world
sometime in 2006.  Critics 

rose up in disbelief as is natural in any case of prophecy and one in particular
claimed he could find the same predictions in regular English literature, and proved his findings with passages
from Moby Dick.
        

        My inclination is to discredit Drosknin, since if you look at any large
text, and slice it some certain 

way, you are bound to find some pattern, no matter how miniscule, just from
probability.  When you run 

regressions, if you have enough independent variables you are bound to find a
significant relationship eventually 

even though one may not exist.  In my opinion this arbitrary letter spacing does
not support a credible prophecy 

because it is too forgiving in its pattern-finding and the Bible is too large a
text.

<TD ALIGN=left>This holiday shopping season proved to be even worse for the nation's retailers
that anyone has expected.  Merchants that normally perform very well, such as
Wal-Mart, saw same-store sales up only 2.3% (reduced Wall Street estimate of 2.6%). Additionally, Target same-store sales were down 0.3%, while Kohl's was up 3.3% from
2001 compared to a Wall Street estimate of being up 6%.  Stores like Ann Taylor and
Talbots were hit even harder in these times of economic uncertainty and lack of
spending.  In fact, in aggregate, same-store sales for the combined November and
December period, which accounts for 25% of retailers' annual revenues, rose only
.5% from 2001.  This is the weakest recorded growth since this index wasimplemented in 1970.  In 2001, over the November-December period, same-store sales
were up 2.2% from 2000.  
          These figures are a telling sign of the current state of the economy. 
They confirm the beliefs that exist that the economy is in a very weak and fragile
state right now, and people are not willing to spend money because of the
uncertainty of what is to come.  Seeing popular stores like Ann Taylor and Talbots
down 14.6% and 9.1% respectively, consumers are only spending their money on items
that they need and not on frivolous extras.  These statistics are very important in
illustrating that point.

<TD ALIGN=left>A recent study has shown that golden retrievers are 35% smarter than the average dog. 

This is clearly a flawed study - golden retrievers are
at least 50% smarter than the average dog. Closer investigation shows that the study was conducted by a 
German Shepherd.
