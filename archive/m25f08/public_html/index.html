			<p style="text-align : justify">This course is an
introduction to number theory.  Eric Temple Bell once said that mathematics is
the "queen of science" and number theory is the "queen of mathematics."
Royalty aside, number theory is downright interesting, accessible, and useful.
We will discuss unique factorization into primes and modular arithmetic,
with applications in cryptography.  Other topics will be broached as time
and interest allows.

Homework for Monday, October 20 is posted
<B><A href="m25f08hw4.pdf">here.</A></B><br>
<b>Comments:</b> We did not get to discuss <i>strong</i> pseudoprimes yet,
so delete that word from problem 8.<br>
A hint on problem 7: Assume not and show that there is a unique
element of order 2 (terminology from problem 3); but on the other
hand, show there are at least 3 elements of order 2.<br>
On problem 1, I forgot to mention that <i>u, v</i> 
are positive integers.
</p>

<p>
<b>Homework due Monday, October 13:</b><br>
1. Describe the integers <i>n</i> for which <i>3n &equiv; 5 (mod 7)</i>.<br><br>
2. Describe the integers <i>n</i> for which <i>3n &equiv; 6 (mod 12)</i>.<br><br>
3. Describe the integers <i>n</i> for which both <i>n &equiv; 1 (mod 10)</i>
and <i>n &equiv; 0 (mod 11)</i>.<br><br>
4. Describe the integers <i>n</i> for which both <i>n &equiv; 1 (mod 4)</i>
and <i>n &equiv; 3 (mod 6)</i>.<br><br>
5. Describe the integers <i>n</i> for which both <i>n &equiv; 2 (mod 4)</i>
and <i>n &equiv; 3 (mod 6)</i>.<br><br>
6. Call a positive integer <i>n</i> special if the congruence
<i>x<sup>2</sup> &equiv;  1 (mod n)</i> has exactly two solutions
modulo <i>n</i>.  For example, 3 is special since the solutions
are 1 and 2 modulo 3, while 2 is not special, since there is
just the one solution 1 modulo 2.  Find the special numbers up
to 20.<br><br>
7. Using the terminology of problem 6, formulate and prove a
characterization of the special numbers.  Your proof should
have two parts: show that the numbers you say are special actually are
special, and show that the numbers you say are not special
actually are not special.  (So this hard problem is actually 3 problems:
the formulation of the conjecture, the proof of one side of the conjecture,
and the proof of the other side of the conjecture.  You should use
only tools from Chapter 3 or earlier in our book.<br><br>
8. Prove that there is an integer <i>n</i> such that <i>n</i> is
divisible by <i>2</i>, <i>n+1</i> is divisible by <i>3</i>, <i>n+2</i> is divisible
by <i>5</i>, <i>n+3</i> is divisible by <i>7</i>, and <i>n+4</i> is divisible by <i>11</i>.
(You need not exhibit such a number.)<br>
</p>

<p> 
<b>Homework due Monday, October 6:</b><br>
1.  Find the least common multiple of the integers up to 10.<br>
2.  Describe the integer solutions to the equation 15<i>x</i>+19<i>y</i>=4.<br>
3.  If <i>a, b</i> are coprime positive integers, prove that each integer
<i>n</i>><i>ab-a-b</i> can be written in the form <i>ax</i>+<i>by</i>
with <i>x, y</i> nonnegative integers.  But <i>ab-a-b</i> cannot be so
written.<br>
4.  Show that if <i>a, b, c</i> are positive integers then
[<i>a,b,c</i>]=<i>abc(a,b,c)/((a,b)(a,c)(b,c))</i> by using the
Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic and the functions <i>v<sub>p</sub></i>.
(Recall that <i>v<sub>p</sub>(n)</i> is the exponent on <i>p</i> in
the prime factorization of <i>n</i>.)<br>
5.  Show that there are infinitely many primes that leave the remainder 5
when divided by 6.<br>
6.  Show that if <i>n</i> is a sufficiently large integer, then
below <i>10<sup>n</sup</i> there is a run of at least <i>n</i>
consecutive numbers that are composite.  (You are allowed to assume
the Prime Number Theorem.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Homework assignment due Monday, September 29.</b><br>
1. Use Euclid's algorithm to find gcd(1234,4321).<br>
2. Use Euclid's algorithm to find integers <i>u,v</i> as
in Bezout's identity for 1234 and 4321.<br>
3. Suppose <i>a,b</i> are integers not both 
zero.  Show that each common divisor of <i>a,b</i> divides (<i>a,b</i>).<br>
4. Let <i>n</i> be an integer.  Show that the set of integers coprime
with <i>n</i> are closed under multiplication.  (That is, the product
of any two of them is also coprime with <i>n</i>.)<br>

<p> Special grading policy:  There are 4 grades that will count towards
your final average, namely the two midterms, the cumulative homework grade,
and the final exam.  If you attend at least one of Ken Ono's lectures
(preferably the one Tuesday evening, November 18, 7 pm, Kemeny 008),
the lowest of these grades, call it L, will be replaced by the
maximum of L+5 and (L+90)/2.  After this alteration, your final average
will be figured as follows:  if the lowest grade is one of the midterms
or the homework, it will be dropped and your final average will 
be the average of the remaining 3 grades, with the final exam weighted
as double; if the lowest grade is the final exam, the final average
will be the straight average of the 4 grades.  If you go to one or
both of Ono's lectures, please inform me that you did this.
