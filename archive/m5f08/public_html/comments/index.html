<H2>Math 5: Aural postings</H2>

<p>
Please post real-world examples of mathematical,
musical, or sonic phenomena we discuss in class, either in the form
of discussion,
articles, links, spectrograms, pictures, 
or best of all <b>sound files</b> (either from recordings, found,
or produced by yourself).
If you post a sound file, please describe what it is, why we should
care, what phenomena it relates to.
You do not have to post every single week, but should aim for 5-7 interesting
posts in total. The more you do (and more thoughtful and interesting!),
the more credit.
We will discuss them at the start of each <b>Monday</b> lecture.
Happy aural hunting!
</p>

<p>
Enter your post in the window below. You <b>must</b> provide your name.
If you don't provide your name and submit the comment,
the comment will <b>disappear</b> from the text field
and you will have to <b>type it again</b>. To avoid frustration
I suggest you compose your comment on a text editor then paste in
when you're ready.
Scroll down to read <A HREF= "index.html#comments_start_here">previous posts</A>.


<p>
For uploading <b>sound files</b> there is a <b>2MB limit</b>, ie
about 2 minutes of MP3 or OGG format, but only 12 seconds of WAV.
Therefore I recommend you use MP3 or OGG (convert using audacity).
In all cases keep them short!
Your uploaded files will remain on the Math Dept server.
Unfortunately you <b>cannot remove</b> a comment or file yourself;
email me if you must have something removed.
We all take it for granted you won't post dumb/offensive material.
</p>

<p>
You may embed HTML in your post such as &lt;BR&gt;, &lt;P&gt;,
<BR>
&lt;B&gt;...&lt;/B&gt;, etc for formatting purposes.
I encourage you to include <b>links</b>
like this: &lt;a href="http://interesting.site.org/"&gt;check it out!&lt;/a&gt;
<BR>
You may also cut from a document and paste into the comments area.

<TD ALIGN=left>This is a clip taken off youtube which plays different frequencies and text shows up to label the specific frequency being played. These frequences sound like a "beeping" noise and gets higher and higher in pitch; it is known as a hearing test.  Depending upon one's age, audible frequencies will be between 20-30 Hz on the low side of the audio spectrum, and 10-16 kiloHertz on the high side of the audio spectrum. Some people can hear the whole spectrum between 16 Hz and 20 kHz. Personally, i could no longer hear the "beep" at 14kHz.  You can click on the link and see how long you can hear the frequencies being played.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G60hM1W_mk

<TD ALIGN=left>This is a guitar resonating with a note on the flute. I had to amplify the bejeezus out of everything, so the flute clipped and the resonance is still pretty weak. It was too weak to do any math, but it's a good demonstration of the principle. </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is me clapping and hearing the echoes off of the barn. Using a method similar to the demo, I used half the interval between claps to calculate distance. The period of the claps is 0.6 seconds so the sound pulse travels 340m/s for 0.3 seconds. This means a total distance traveled of 102m. Half that to get my distance to the barn = 51m. It's actually 48m by my measurement, but that's pretty accurate.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Forgot to upload this earlier! Here is Stevie Wonder schooling the Talk Box while playing the song "Papa Was A Rolling Stone". As you can see, there is a tube in his mouth. He mouths the words he would like the keyboard to "sing," and his mouth alters the harmonic content of the output to make it sound like the keyboard is producing the lyrics. It's just awesome!

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>In Will and my presentation, I mentioned spectral music and one of its founders, Gerard Grisey.  One of the pieces that Grisey wrote is called "Partiels".  "Partiels" was composed off of the spectrogram of a low E2 on a trombone, with Grisey trying to orchestrally synthesize the same sound through assigning a different instrument to each partial present in the original sound. 

The piece is part of the "Les Espaces Acoustiques" cycle, which contains a number of pieces related to explore the sonic space.

Here is a youtube video of the beginning of "Partiels"--try to imagine the sound of a trombone when you listen:

<TD ALIGN=left>As further proof that we recognize sources and sounds from their onsets and progress, I challenge you all to guess this tune. Should you need some help, upload it into audacity and use the "reverse" effect under "effect: utility: time changer". Enjoy!</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is Alvin and the Chipmunks singing.  I was curious as to how the voices were done, as they originated in 1958.  I found out that the voice was done by Ross Bagdasarian, Sr. who simply sped up the playback.  He would record singing slowly, then when he played the tape twice as fast, the frequency doubled, and therefore the pitch went up an octave, to the squeaky voices of the chipmunks.  I used audacity to slow the recording so i could hear his original voice, and it is funny, it just sounds like a normal person singing way too slow.  </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is a recorded thunderstorm. Analyzing the spectrum its pretty easy to see its a very low frequency that you hear the rain drops at. Also when the thunder occurs on a spectrum that looks almost identical to a clap. There are countless frequencies present here, because the rain drops do not produce a consistent frequency. But the two main peaks of the plot spectrum are at 50hz and 80hz which are both very low. </TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>I thought it would be cool to analyze a wolf howl given the programs we have.  It is easy to see the changes in pitch as time progresses during the wolf's howl.  You can see the fundamental frequencies and its higher partials.  I also wondered if showed any resemblance to human speech as this is a means of communication for them just as speech is for us.  I checked the formants.  It is difficult to tell if there are formants in the wolf's howl throughout, but there did seem to be formants present.  In one section of the wolf's howl, there seemed to be 2 formants just as in human speech (they were at 620 Hz and 2200 Hz).</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is a fog horn that is played when the Minnesota Wild score a goal. I analyzed it and looked at its decay time which ended up being 2.9 seconds, as well as its frequencies to see if it was a periodic signal or not. Looking at the spectrogram and waves you'd almost think it was periodic, but after a closer look at the frequencies you realize its not. 775, 1761, 2690, & 3744 hz    </TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>I blew over an empty water bottle.  I analyzed it in Praat and found the fundamental frequency to be about 207Hz, which is almost exactly a G3#.  I thought that this was a Helmholtz resonator and thus applied the formula.  Volume was .5L or .0005 m^3, length of neck was 2cm or .02m, the area of the neck was .0001pi given the radius of about 1cm or .01m.  I found the frequency to be about 280Hz, not very close at all to the actual frequency.  This may be due to the fact that I used the speed of sound for the velocity of air when the air actually moved at the speed I was blowing the air at.  There was also moisture in the bottle which may have absorbed some of the sound.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is myself clapping in my room.  I analyzed it in Praat to find its reverberation time which turned out to be .24 seconds which is extremely short.  This makes sense as all of the clothes and sheets in my room are very much sound absorbing.  You can hear from the clip that there is almost no reverberation.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This video is incredible. I stumbled upon it on a humour site... the guy is quirky, but the demonstration is awesome. He does a  "Rubens Tube to visualize sound."

Basically he has a speaker attached to a tube with evenly spaced holes which are leading to a propane tank. When he ignites the tube and plays sound through it, he creates a rubens tube. This makes standing waves and sin curves because of the sound compressions. He changes frequency and the wave correspondingly changes.

<TD ALIGN=left>http://news.uns.purdue.edu/UNS/html4ever/030423.Smith.singing.html

This links goes to an article about recent research (from 2003, not sure if there has been much progress since) on development of a computer system that alters an average singing voice into one much more refined and professional. Reading this article made me think about the homework question where we altered our voice and in general about the differences between the male and female voice. The researchers mention that they are having more success with altering the higher pitched female voices.

The website also has several small audio clips that can be played.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This video reflects speed of sound changes that we were talking about. Whether it's through strings or helium or normal air, the speed can be completely different. As Adam from MythBusters says in this video, helium is 6 times less dense than air, so sound waves travel faster and his voice gets higher. But when he inhales Sulfur Hexafluoride, which is 6 times MORE dense the air, the results are incredible

His post-Sulfur-Hexaflouride-inhalation voice contains VERY strong high harmonics which accounts for demonic/harsher tone of his voice.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Attached is a sound clip of the low string of an electric guitar being bowed with a violin bow.  Will and I discovered this sound while working on our final project and thought that this sound had some interesting properties.

If you import this file into Praat and analyze it for pitch, you can see that it starts at 82 Hz, which is an E2.  However, the bowing of the string pulls the string so far out of its normal shape that the frequency slides all the way up to 86 Hz (slightly flat of F2) before sliding back down to 82 Hz.  Each time that the string is bowed the pitch bends slightly different amounts, sometimes all the way up to 88 Hz, which is sharp of F2.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is actually some research I did earlier in the term that I forgot to post until now--I looked into the lowest pitch recorded, and found some interesting information.  First, Bosendorfer Piano company makes an "Imperial" model with an extended lower register ranging all of the way down to 16.35 Hz, or C0--I found something that claimed to be a sample of this, but was clearly just a pure tone generated at that frequency.  Also interesting was a post I found to "Contrabass Digest" (http://www.contrabass.com/2002/2002-06-08.html).  The post details one man's attempt to build a 64' long contrabass clarinet, and he manages to produce oscillations as low as 4 Hz!  Unfortunately, there are no sound files here either. The last piece of interesting low-frequency research is that there is a composer who specializes in writing for the octocontrabass clarinet (http://www.contrabass.com/pages/octobass.html), an instrument that ranges down to Bb-1 (or 14.57 Hz).

Wish I could find some sound files of that octocontrabass clarinet, but they seem to be nowhere to be found.  There are some pictures though: http://kunst.no/lerstad/octos.html.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>These sounds were made by a small hollow whistle in the shape of a bird sitting on a tree stump.  A mouthpiece with a V-shaped slot angles upward from the bottom of the stump, and there is a small opening in the bird’s beak.  Essentially, the whistle is two roughly cylindrical chambers (the stump and the bird’s body), separated by a narrow opening (the bird’s legs). The first part of the clip shows the noise made by blowing into the mouthpiece.  This appears to be white noise.  The second part of the clip shows the sound produced by blowing through the mouthpiece after the stump has been filled with water.  The warbling sound thus produced appears to be short bursts of white noise with no definite partials.  What mechanism would produce such a sound? </TD>

after talking about how we understand direction of sound the other day, I found this website online. Unless your speakers are positioned perfectly, it will only work with headphones on, and is explained in the 'virtual haircut.' The illusion is called Holophonic sound, and in the future may be used in movies, games, etc.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is a youtube sound clip of binaural beats. I find these to be very interesting because many people claim that it is helpful for insomniacs. The basic premise behind them is called frequency following response. By creating frequency waves similar to that of brain waves, the beats can drop brain wave frequency and put a person in a more restful state and help them sleep.

<TD ALIGN=left>The Blue Man Group is regarded as one of the most modern and innovative musical groups of the 20th century. Their music includes theatrical acts incorporating rock music with emphasis on percussion, performance art, odd props, audience participation, and sophisticated lighting. Our project will focus on one of their many instruments called the Drumbone. The Blue Man Group uses many concepts and functions found in classical instruments in their own inventions. The Drumbone, a spinoff of the Trombone, is made of PVC pipes that slide in length to create different notes. The Drumbone creates different sounds by striking one end of the pipe with drum sticks. In a sense, this percussion instrument incorporates concepts of a open-open ended pipe. Our study will entail how the construction of our own Drumbone produces different pitch and tone. We will observe how end correction plays a part in making the drumbone a successful instrument. It will be interesting to see how acoustic pressure at the piston and where the drumbone is struck impacts air speed and the production of sound.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is me playing my didjeridu (australian aboriginal instrument). The reason it sounds more like flatulence than music is because i haven't really practiced enough, but I am still able to show a couple of the really cool effects the didjeridu is capable of. First, I'm just going "eeeeee-ooooooo-eeee" etc. I assume that the formants still apply because its also a pipe. Secondly, I sing a pitch slightly off from the note I'm playing. The beat frequency is so strong it literally shakes the floor. I highly recommend going on youtube and searching; talented players can do some truly incredible things.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is just ridiculous. In this audio clip, Adam Lopez sings the highest note by a man. He held the previous record at a D7 and hoped to beat it. By the end of the clip, he ends up hitting a C#8 (4490Hz). That note, for those who are wondering, is off the piano. Good god.

<TD ALIGN=left>We intend to construct a marimba-type instrument capable of playing several notes. We want to examine the effect that resonator quality has on the pitch and/or timbre of the notes. We will explore this by changing the resonator medium (ie putting water in the resonators) and adjusting their effective size. Hopefully this modification to the resonators can be adjusted with a foot pedal so that the player can manipulate the sound while playing the instrument. We are going to analyze the notes being played using Praat and Audacity software. We will then explain the various effects using mathematical models analogous to size and wavelength as well as the mass/spring analogy. </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>For my project, I plan to compose a short piece.  The attached file is an excerpt from the first movement of Steve Reich's Electric Counterpoint (1987).  It's one of my favorite pieces of electronically-influenced music, and Reich is widely regarded as one of the greatest American composers and a pioneer in musical minimalism.  I plan to use some of its techniques as a model to compose to.  Reich samples a lot of different sounds and pieces and blends them together in a variety of ways: he loops short segments with varying delays, etc; he phases sounds in and out of pieces to create different patterns and textures, and uses countless other techniques.  I'm not sure what I'll use as the base material.  It could be a lot of fun to take one of Bach's Two-Part Inventions and work with a few phrases out of it.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>For my project, I'm going to compose a piece (or perhaps a series of short pieces) on the guitar that employ and explore several of the musical/mathematical concepts we've talked about in class, including harmonics, excitation of various modes, string tension as it relates to sound production, playing back recording phrases backward, and others.  My aim is not simply to engage these elements, but to toy around with them, manipulating them such that I ultimately produce a work whose compositional foundation is mathematical but that succeeds in being musically satisfying/interesting as well.  I'm curious to discover how this will compare to the process of composing with music theory as the foundation, or composing without any distinct systemized base.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>The recording in this post is my voice pronouncing 'ee', 'aa', and 'oo' in succession.  The next post contains the same file but with the gender converted by a factor of 1.3.  The resulting sound sounds higher and with a buzzier timbre.  The pitch is the same, and all that has changed are the formants, which have shifted upwards, now residing at higher harmonic contents.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This repeating sequence of signals, if played on repeat, appears to continually be getting higher in pitch forever. They are called Shepard's tones, and are basically constructed by overlapping ascending or descending scales in a particular way.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>Since the previous posting did not work, I've re-uploaded the file. Here's the info from the last post:


Here is "Tomorrow Never Knows"(The Beatles, Revolver) an example of vocals running through a Leslie speaker, which we mentioned in class today is a rotating speaker that is in a Hammond console that causes Doppler effect. You can adjust the speed of rotation with a knob on the consul so to vary the effect. Geoff Emerick (the Beatles' engineer) processed John Lennon's voice through a Leslie speaker, and the result was a very expiremental sound. According to a few online sources, this song was actually the first time that anyone ever recorded vocals through a Leslie. You can hear the effect come in for the line "Love is all and love is everyone/Is it knowing? Is it knowing?" which comes in half-way through the track. But I hear the Doppler effect most prominently in the next line though, especially during the second "believing" part of the line "That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead it is believing, it is believing." For general interest, here's just a quote about Lennon's intentions for the effect, as recounted by one of the engineers: "For Tomorrow Never Knows [Lennon] said to me he wanted his voice to sound like the Dalai Lama chanting from a hilltop, and I said, 'It's a bit expensive, going to Tibet. Can we make do with it here?' I knew perfectly well that ordinary echo or reverb wouldn't work, because it would just put a very distant voice on. We needed to have something a bit weird and metallic..."</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>This is a cast iron skillet.  When I plotting the spectrum on Audacity, the partials are far to many to name, and are all relatively close to each other in intensity.  It is obvious that they are not harmonically related.  The decay time is roughly tau =.05 sec.  There are two stronger partials, around 500 B4 and another at 980B5 that showed up in Pratt as being the most intense.  While the sound does not sound like any one note in particular, you can almost pick out a B, especially when playing  a B on the piano and then playing the sound.  These partials, as can be seen on Pratt, takes much longer to decay.  </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>The first sound was created with contact to the middle of the frying pan. It had major partials at 1110 Hz, 1740 Hz. The second sound was created halfway between the middle and the edge. It had major partials at the same partials but also at 611 Hz (and also many other softer partials that didn't exist in the first sound).  with the exception of the 1110 Hz frequency everything gets longer in duration. 
the first sound had a tau value of approximately .02322 seconds, while the second sound was approximately .03048 seconds long.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This sound is a metal knife hitting an empty 5 gallon water jug. When the sound file was analyzed in pratt from a frequency range of 0 to 500 HZ, there were 5 solid partials that could be recorded before the sound was for all intensive purposes fully decayed. These partials were 2722 Hz at 84.4 DB, 3112 Hz at 87 Db, 3855 Hz at 81.6 DB, 4227 Hz at 85.8 DB, and 4774 Hz at 81.1 DB. The decay time for the partials that were measured by observing short ranges of time in the spectrogram. These decay times were around .26 seconds, though it was much harder to analyze the decay rate of the final partials because they were so faint.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Thick Glass Mug. This sound is a metal knife hitting the glass of a mug near the rim of the glass. Based on analysis in Praat from 0 to 5000 hz, there seem to be around 5 reasonably strong partials (in terms of dB strength): 1803.61 Hz at 124.3dB, 2500Hz at 104dB, 3252.1Hz at 102.3dB, 3716.37Hz at 107.7dB, and 4152.77Hz at 110.9dB. Taking the spectral slice of the spectrogram at the time of impact allowed accurate measurement of the initial strength and the frequency of the partials. In addition, the upper three partials may be harmonically related as they are evenly spaced with respect to frequency. Estimating Tau(decay time) for each of these yields, .1077, .0322, .013, .0346, and .0266 seconds respectively. This is an appropriate because the sound dies down in around or less than half a second, showing that the decay time for all partials is around .1 or less seconds. </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>I used a ceremic flower pot. To produce the sound, I clanged a pen on the outer part of the flower pot. I used the frequency analysis plot diagram to see the different frequencies the sound produced. The peak frequencies existed at 750 Hz and 2020 Hz. These two frequencies shows the different modes produced by the sound. The modes do not relate and show to be asymetric. The second tap showed to have the same strong modes at the approximately the same frequencies. The decay times for both sounds are the same.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is me hitting the D string on my guitar in two places
on the string without holding it down and changing the length. This caused it to vibrate in many different modes with more prominent partials wherever I struck it. When i hit in the middle of the string I found partials of 144 and 290 HZ, respectively D3 and D4. When I hit in between this area and the nut of the guitar audacity showed many partials including D3 and 4 along with A2, 3, 4, and 5. frequencies were 109, 144, 218, 291, 435, and 871 Hz.

<TD ALIGN=left>A hand drum that seemed to have two modes - one hitting in the center and one hitting towards the edge.  The first hit is in the center and is the deeper sound while the second hit is higher in pitch.  The lower beat has strong partials at 68, 202 and 334, and 480 with lesser partials at 420 and 711.  The higher beat on the other hand has very strong partials at 331, 480, and 707 Hz with 68 being a lesser partial. This shows how the sound is a sum of the two modes at different intensities.  The first, lower sound had a longer decay time of about 0.145 second while the higher sound had a shorter decay time of about  0.11 seconds.  In the lower sound, the higher frequency partials decayed faster while in the higher sound, the lower frequency partials decayed faster.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>A glass bowl about 12 inches in diameter across its top was struck with a stick and the sound recorded.  Spectrogram analysis with Praat showed strong partials at 713, 1303, 2240, 3421, and 4737 Hz.  Interestingly, the average amplitude of the signal showed a marked pulsation with time, having a beat period of ca. 0.2 s.  This suggests that the bowl has two modes whose frequency differ by ca. 5 Hz.  Close examination of the partial at 1303 HZ (by narrowing down the frequency range to 1250-1350 Hz) showed a pulsation in amplitude of about the same beat period of 0.2 s.  This suggests that there may, in fact, be two modes with frequencies of 1303 +/- 2 to 3 Hz, giving rise to an apparent partial at 1303Hz.  This partial shows an additional interesting feature: the pulsation in amplitude is not symmetrical about the mean frequency, but instead seems to occur more to the high frequency side.  Is there perhaps an additional mode near the other two which is giving rise to the observed asymmetry?

To extract decay times from the Praat spectrogram, I used the following procedure:  At time 0.11 sec into the spectrogram, a 10 msec slice of the spectrogram was selected and the spectral slice option used to display the partials and their intensities.  The intensities were then measured for the partials at 713, 2240, 3421, and 4737 Hz.  The same procedure was then repeated for a 10 msec time slice at 0.20 sec into the spectrogram, yielding another set of intensities for the chosen partials.  The decay times were than calculated for each partial using the formula tau = 20 x (delta t) x log e / (delta dB), where (delta t) is the elapsed time between the two intensity measurements (0.09 sec) and delta dB is the change in the intensity over this period, measured in dB.  The taus found for the partials in question were 120, 32, ca 50, and 28 msec.  The value for the partial at 3421 HZ is only approximate at best, since the maximum peak amplitude in the spectral slice taken at 0.11 sec was near 3365 Hz, suggesting overlap with another partial.

It was also possible to use much the same procedure in Audacity.  Spectra of 10 msec slices were taken at the same two intervals, delta t apart, and subjected to frequency analysis.  The results of the analyses were then exported to two files, from which it was possible to read off directly the values of delta dB.

As a check on the two procedures, I used them to calculate tau for the tuning fork example in the homework.  The results were within a few percent of those calculated by the direct measurement of decay, as used in the homework.  Of course, the tuning fork represents a particularly easy case, since the decay period is long compared to the sampling period of 10 msec, and consequently the latter gives a more accurate measure of the instantaneous intensity (and hence amplitude) than is the case with the glass bowl.  However, the procedure probably gives values which are good to +/- 25%, and, as in the glass bowl case, it should show up differences in decay times for the different partials.

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>I tapped a plastic glass on two parts of its side with a pen.  For the first tap the strongest partials were at 856, 1398, 1539, qnd 1569 Hz.  For the second tap the strongest partials were at 781, 1427, and 1527 Hz.  This, and the fact that the two pitches are clearly aurally different suggest that different modes were being excited with the two taps (a certain amount of error due to the use of a pen, itself not an entirely uniform material, should be acknowledged).  Importantly, though, the decay times for the two taps were essentially equal - it took the first sound 0.244 seconds to drop 30dB and the second sound 0.231 seconds to do so.  The decay times of course should be the same.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is me banging an ice-cream scooper on a pot lid. The pot lid is what you can hear ringing. Frequency analysis shows that the lowest two partials are 161Hz and 524Hz. These two frequencies are not harmonically related, which means that the pot lid has at least two modes of motion. The spectrum has many more clear partials. Some of the most prominent partials are 523Hz and 1026Hz, which are C5 and C6 respectively. As the sound decays, the lid sounds more clearly like a C4, which probably means that   C5 and C6 have the longest decay times. </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>I clanged 2 identical vases together and analyzed their plot spectrum on audacity.  It turned out that the clang produced 2 different frequencies the first 2 times I clanged them (3623Hz and 6627Hz).  These frequencies are unrelated to each other and thus 2 of the modes of the vase.  The third time I clanged it, there were 4 frequencies (3607, 3798, 6656, and 12980).  I clanged them in a different spot which may have caused this if I excited other modes.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbkNxYaULBw

so this guy is doing what we looked at in class today,
he's singing a song reversed and playing it backwards(the rightway), It's interesting to listen to all the noise in the background as well as his own voice backwards, balloons popping backwards definitely showed a surprising difference (one would expect really short sounds to be more recognizable, but thats not the case) anyway, its a fun clip and you can have fun guessing what he's singing</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is a gong. I thought that it would be similar to a bell in that it would have non-periodic partials.  For about the first second after i struck it, there were partials at seemingly non related intervals, except for one at 220 and 440.  However, after a second, all of the partials drastically died down except for the A3.  There were still discernible partials, however, nothing that came close to the magnitude of the A3. the second loudest partial was a D#5, and interestingly, this partial changed to a G#5 later on in the note (around 6-7 seconds)  and finally to a G5 in the last second (10-11).</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>Here is "Tomorrow Never Knows"(The Beatles, Revolver) an example of vocals running through a Leslie speaker, which we mentioned in class today is a rotating speaker that is in a Hammond console that causes Doppler effect.  You can adjust the speed of rotation with a knob on the consul so to vary the effect.

Geoff Emerick (the Beatles' engineer) processed John Lennon's voice through a Leslie speaker, and the result was a very expiremental sound. According to a few online sources, this song was actually the first time that anyone ever recorded vocals through a Leslie.


 You can hear the effect come in for the line "Love is all and love is everyone/Is it knowing? Is it knowing?" which comes in half-way through the track. But I hear the Doppler effect most prominently in the next line though, especially during the second "believing" part of the line "That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead it is believing, it is believing."

For general interest, here's just a quote about Lennon's intentions for the effect, as recounted by one of the engineers: "For Tomorrow Never Knows [Lennon] said to me he wanted his voice to sound like the Dalai Lama chanting from a hilltop, and I said, 'It's a bit expensive, going to Tibet. Can we make do with it here?' I knew perfectly well that ordinary echo or reverb wouldn't work, because it would just put a very distant voice on. We needed to have something a bit weird and metallic..."

<TD ALIGN=left>Steve Reich takes a simple violin gesture, creates a copy that is very slightly longer (by adding a tiny bit of silence at the end), and then loops both.  The effect is a sound that gradually grows out of phase with itself.  It actually takes a while - longer than I expected - to become noticeably two voices, but the sound of the one voice changes as the sound waves overlay each other differently.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>While almost all popular musicians use equal-tempered tuning on all of their instruments, one guitarist who famously tunes his guitar differently is Eddie Van Halen.  Van Halen tunes his B string slightly flat, so that the major 3rd between his G and B strings is a justly tuned 3rd, instead of an equal tempered one.  He does this because the slight beating apparent in an equal-tempered major 3rd sounds bad when played on a guitar with distortion.  To explain why he tunes his guitar differently, he says: 
"A guitar is just theoretically built wrong. Each string is an interval of fourths, and then the B string is off. Theoretically, that's not right. If you tune an open A chord in the first position and it's perfectly in tune, and then you hit a barre chord an octave higher, it's out of tune. The B string is always a motherfucker to keep in tune all the time!"

The attached sound clip is the beginning of the Van Halen song "Runnin' With the Devil."  A plot spectrum run on one of the chords (a D# major) gave the following frequencies: 79 (D#), 119 (A#), 159 (D#), 198 (G).  The 3rd between the D# and G is in the ratio 1.245, very close to the ratio of a justly tuned major 3rd, 5:4.

<TD ALIGN=left>This is one way to tune strings on a guitar. Since the strings are tuned to a perfect fourth, the third harmonic on the lower  string = the second harmonic on the higher string. If the pitches aren't exactly aligned, there is an audible beat frequency. Guitar players use this to help get their strings exactly in tune.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>The human voice is amazing! And I wanted to know what made a particular singer's voice so special (his name is SungSiKyung). So I looked at the singer's vowels. His sound waves looked incredibly clean and I've been trying to find another singer with similar qualities with little success(through audacity). I found a "girl version" of his singing online. Someone chose to change the key of one of his recordings and it sounds like a girl's voice. I tried the same thing with other singers and their voices sound like chipmunks before it resembles the female voice. I thought that this was interesting.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is an A0 on an acoustic piano.  If you listen closely you can hear the individual "clicks" per second, like on the metronome. It should be around 27.5hz.  Keeping my finger on the note, i can even feel the mechanical vibrations, which i cant feel at higher frequency notes.
Another interesting thing to note is that when i plotted the spectrum on audacity and looking at the peaks there were so many overtones that it didnt seem to have any idea what the note was.

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>The two passages in this clip illustrate the large range of note pitch that can be found in Western classical music.  The low note at about 15 seconds into the clip is from the opening of Bach’s Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, and the high note at about 48 seconds is from Allegri’s Miserere.  
According to the score, the low note in the Bach is D2.   Analysis of this note with Audacity does show a series of harmonics corresponding to D0, D1, D2, D3, etc., although the actual pitch is closer to D# than D.  If this series of pure tones is played sequentially through the laptop speakers, the lowest that I can hear is D3, yet when the clip itself is played through these same speakers, the pitch of the note in question sounds correct.  Is this an example of a missing fundamental?  Is it possible that a note which otherwise cannot be transmitted as a pure tone can “piggyback” on a more complex waveform and still be heard by the ear?

<TD ALIGN=left>This is a plain old C minor chord.  C minor is one of my favorite chords, and a number of the greatest works ever composed are in the key of c minor...one of the most notable being Beethoven's 5th, op. 67.  This is a brief recording of Sibelius playing a c minor chord, here in root position and made up of C4, Eb4, and G4.  I wanted to see how well the frequency plot would represent those notes.  Those three were indeed the largest peaks, but interestingly, one of the next largest peaks was G#3.  One would think that adding a G# into c minor would not be terribly pleasant.</TD>

While not all of them clipped, here are three in a row which did.  You can hear the distortion at the peak of each snapping sound, and if you look at the sound wave in audacity you can see it running into +1 and -1 and flattening out at those pressures.</TD>

The first thing you'll hear is the traditional plucking of a guitar string, the frequency generally stays the same while the amplitude decreases. However when I grab the string and pull up and down, parallel to the string the frequency and amplitude are both subject to change. The frequency and amplitude would increase and decrease with the speed of my hand. </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is the sound of a violin playing the note D. I asked the violinist to play as many octaves of the same note as she could. She could only play two octaves which is proven by looking at the Plot Spectrum which shows that she played the frequencies of D4 and D5 whose frequencies were 292 and 585 hertz respectively, thus fulfilling the necessary ratio of 1:2 for the violin to produce two notes that sound like the same pitch. </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is the sound of a mazda miata honking its horn. I thought it was interesting since I've heard the myth that most car horns are in the key of F. This sound actually does come very close to F, when using the frequency 22050 given by audacity</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>This is the sound of the esteemed Bone Gate fraternity's piano, notorious for its keys caked with beer and other unmentionables. I sampled the A4 in audacity and zoomed in until the signal appeared sinosoidal. After finding a good segment, I identified the period of the wave to be .0023 seconds (21.0130s was the beginning point and 21.0107s was the point of repetition). Given that frequency is the reciprocal of period, this yielded a frequency of 434.78 Hz. We know that an appropriately tuned A4 is 440 Hz. Thus this aural experiment affirmed my initial suspicion that the Bone's Gate A4, like the brotherhood, is just slightly off.

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>One of my guitars hadn't been tuned in about two months.  I was curious how flat the tuning of any given note might be.  I tuned the low E string and played the 5th fret A.  Analyzing its frequency showed that it was at about 110, essentially perfectly tuned to A2.  That note is what is posted here.  I played the octave A on the 7th fret of the untuned D string.  That note is posted in the following post (sorry for the inconvenience).  Analyzing that, I got a frequency reading of about 214.  The frequency ratio formula gives a semitone number of  about -0.48 relative to A3, or close to -0.5.  This means that after having not been tuned in a number of weeks, for that particular note the error was about 50 cents - not enough to sound terrible, but halfway to being another note entirely.  The lesson: tune your instrument (or at least a guitar) often.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Wind Chimes. These wind chimes reside outside my door, and I occasionally hit them once on the way in. To me, this track is roughly analogous to the beating amplitude when two tones of close frequencies are played together. Even though this sound is the combination of 6 tones (which are actually probably not pure tones within themselves), it reminds me of this 'beating' concept because each chime is being struck with different time spaces between hits. Therefore, sometimes they are struck together creating a noise which appears to be louder in amplitude, and sometimes they are struck independently, producing a softer, one tone-at-a-time sound. </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>The sound you hear is a ping pong ball being dropped from about 3 feet. The picture of this looks like a sound wave because the clicking is repetitive. it looks like a sound wave with a decreasing amplitude and increasing frequency. if this were made into a tone it would get softer over time with an increased pitch.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>The sound recorded is the sound of a paper bag. What I was really wondering about was the sound of rustling leaves, it just wasn't as easy to record. What I'm curious about is finding an average pitch of the rustling of leaves, as in find an average frequency that could be made into a pure tone. How could I do that? And assuming this is possible, would it be feasible to be able to tell different types of trees by the pitch of the rustling of their leaves? Just a thought. I suppose you would also have to take into consideration the humidity, the health of the tree, etc. There's probably too many factors affecting the sound to really determine anything.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>The notes in this posting alternate between “low A” and “high A”, as played on a bagpipe practice chanter (sort of like a recorder).  By expanding a small section of each note in Audacity, a complex waveform is revealed.  However, there is a pattern for low A showing a period that corresponds to a frequency of 235.54 Hz. This, in turn, corresponds to 10.82 semitones below A4, or about 18 cents sharp of A#3.  A similar analysis of high A shows a frequency of 465.26 Hz or 0.97 semitones above A4, which is 3 cents flat of A#4.  The frequency ratio of the two notes is 11.78 semitones, or 22 cents flat of an octave.

Why are the two notes tuned closer to A# than A?  It probably has to do with the fact that bagpipe bands compete with each other (for money!).  A higher pitch sounds “brighter” and tends to give a band a competitive advantage.  As a result, as bands started to compete with each other, their pitch tended to drift higher and higher.  One interesting consequence of this is that the drones (the three long pipes over the piper’s shoulder which play a continuous single note) of some older bagpipes cannot be tuned up to modern pitch.

Why are the two A’s not tuned to exactly an octave apart?  Apparently it’s just tradition!  To an experienced piper, a high A tuned exactly an octave above low A sounds “screemingly sharp”, as I have seen it described.

For a discussion of bagpipe tuning which is almost a short course in itself, see:
http://www-personal.umich.edu/%7eemacpher/pipes/acoustics/pipescale.html
Be aware that the “chanter” referred to at this site is the one on the bagpipes themselves, not the practice chanter used to play the audio clip.  However, the tuning of the two chanters is essentially the same.

Some of the entries include the sea organ, singing river stones (listen to the sound clip!), and my favorite the vienna vegetable orchestra.  You can see pictures of pipes made out of carrots, cucumbers, and peppers.  Apparently the troupe of 10 performs and then turns their crafted instruments into a big soup for the audience.  Check out their sound clip too, it's pretty funky stuff.</TD>

This is a link to an episode of Myth Busters in which they test to see if it is actually possible to break a wine glass using the human voice.  They find the resonant frequency of the glass and experiment with using it to excite the glass enough to break it.  I thought it was really interesting to see the application of resonance, and they discuss a lot of the things we have been going over in lecture.</TD>

My buddy showed me this site and it's pretty cool. You need headphones and a quiet room but it plays with the time your ears receive a sound. It gives the illusion that you are in a barbershop. </TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>This is a clip of my Chamber Singers rehearsal, recorded last week in Rollins Chapel.  For this piece, there was a soloist and a chorus, so I thought it would be interesting to analyze a small section of the piece to see whether the soloists' notes come through more clearly in the spectrum than do those of the chorus.  Sure enough, the soloist is singing a high F, and the spectrum shows a peak at 697 Hz, and then another one at the next partial: about 1380 Hz.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>In lieu of an aural posting, I am doing a visual posting - a diagram of a sound phenomena I experienced on Friday afternoon that was so compelling, I could almost see exactly how the sound was moving!

I was walking towards the Green Friday afternoon from the east side of campus.  As I passed between Thornton and Dartmouth Halls, I heard some jazzy folk music coming towards me.  At first I couldn't discern where it was coming from, and then I suddenly had a powerful sense that the sound was coming from my right (see diagram).  I remember wondering, for a brief instant, where the band could possibly be set up, since there's no good spot to do so on the north side of the Green.

Suddenly, I remembered our in-class discussions about reflected sound.  I realized instantly where the music was coming from, because I was now accounting for the equal angles between the reflected sound pulse and me, and between the original sound pulse and the source - Collis porch!  Sure enough, when I finished passing between the two buildings, I heard the sound coming loud and clear from my left, across the Green.

This set-up made for a great sound-mirror!</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>[sorry, thought JB was posting this on Friday]

For our project, JB and myself are going to analyze the acoustics of 4 different buildings/spaces on campus - Leverone Fieldhouse, Thompson Arena, the 1902 room in Baker Library, and the Lobby area of Fairchild - we will be playing a reproducable, identical sound source (probably the alarm button on a megaphone, or a loud cell phone chime) in each space and recording the echo, etc - and analyzing the results - maybe calculate some resonance times? Sky's the limit in math 5. Hopefully those buildings will work, we may need to find some smaller ones. Word!</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Instead of analyzing the acoustics of rooms around campus, I have decided to look more into the history of music theory.  I will primarily focus on the developments in music theory by the Greeks.  I hope to be able to find the history of many of the topics we have studied in class, as well as maybe some other interesting topics relating to math and music.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Term Project

For our term project, we intend to examine the acoustics of several places on campus comprised of different materials, sizes, and shapes.  Using a megaphone which will emit a repeatable, specific sound, we will visit Leverone Field House (steel and windows), Baker Berry's 1902 room (wood), Fairchild Tower (brick and concrete), and Remsen Hockey Rink (ice and steel) to build an analysis of these spaces and the echoes we produce.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>For my project I'm going to do an investigation into a device called a talk box. You're probably familiar with the talk box if you're a Peter Frampton fan as he used it extensively on his live album Frampton Comes Alive. Its basically a an air tight tube which the guitarist puts in his mouth at one end, the tubed taped to a microphone. At the other end, is a pedal box with an input from the guitar signal. It basically uses what we've been talking about with formants and applies it to a guitar signal. The result is sort of a robot sounding synthesis of voice and guitar, its pretty cool. I'm going to look into both the history of this device, and the math and science behind it. </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Project Idea:  I originally thought it would be interesting to analyze the accoustics of the Great Hall in Thayer Engineering School.  However, I went and looked at it and realize that it would be insanely difficult since it has so much structure and so many doors and hallways that lead into it.  So, I started researching online to find an interesting instrument to analyze and write a report about its history.  I stumbled across the "Sea Organ" which was originally created in Croatia.  It is basically a set of stairs that is designed so that when the waves crash onto them it plays music.  I've decided to analyze this structure and the history of how the Sea Organ was built.  And, if possible (although I have no idea how difficult the structure is), build a replica of the "Sea Organ".  Attached is a sample of the sounds of the Sea Organ.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>I hit an upside down stainless steel bowl and it produced a very interesting effect. Zooming in on the graph shows how the sound created pulses as it bounced off the walls of the bowl.  

To measure decay, I examined only the peaks of these minute pulses and found it to be about .036 seconds

The strongest frequencies were all over the place with 552, 764, 1076, and 1480 Hz.  </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is a sound recording of pots and pans clanging my a kitchen.  It is repeated 3 times.  The main frequency of the loudest clang is at 384 hz (G4).  The decay time is very short (.1 seconds), hence we would have a very low Q-factor.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is a recording of a spoon striking a wok top.  The decay rate was very rapid (.05 seconds) but a low bass note hung around for a while afterwards, not always picked up by my computer recording.  But if I held the wok to my ear I could hear the bass note really clearly, similar to a tuning fork.  The partials were 126, 344, and 700 (strongly) as well as 1108, 1344, and 1544 (not so strongly). </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is a recording of me hitting a metal cereal bowl with a plastic spoon towards the side of the bowl. If you analyze it with Audacity you can see that it has numerous partials at non-harmonic intervals, thus indicating the presence of multiple modes. According to pratt, the strongest mode is the one at 669 Hz, though there are others which are higher on the Audacity spectrum including 1569 and 1816 Hz. Other partials include 1141, 2424, and 2576 Hz. The overal decay time seems to be about 0.26 seconds.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>I produced this sound by holding my finger on a piano string (C4, equal-tempered frequency of 261.63 Hz) and playing the note normally. Rather than holding my finger at a specific node, which would have produced a harmonic, I isolated the percussive aspect of the piano hammer hitting the string. The decay time for the sound is approximately .034 seconds. There are many partials, but the strongest partials are at 38, 114, 248, 280, 560, 760, 1315, and 2100 Hz. It is important to note that there is no partial present at or around 261.63, the fundamental frequency of the string I used. </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>I got this sound by hitting a metal box. The main partials were at about 600, 1050, 1550, 2270, 2700, 3000, 3200, and 3460 Hz. It was hard to get an accurate decay time because the envelope was not clear.  I would gues it was about .05 sec. Almost all the partials decayed at the same rate except for two. One was the 3460 partial.  The other was about 750 Hz which was not that intense but for some reason lasted the longest by far.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>I tapped my tin whistle with a pencil.  The main partials were at 1784, 3077, 4029, 4820 and 8707 Hz.  One thing that makes determining the decay time difficult is that, upon closer inspection, I found evidence of a flutter echo.  Sound pulses were probably emitted within the tube as well, and the microphone recorded some of the echoes.  However, if I look just at the first sound, the initial amplitude is 0.26; the signal reaches 0.0962 - 37% of 0.26 - at about 0.017 seconds.  This decay time is rather short, and the Q-factor would be short as well.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>I placed my microphone inside my empty nalgene bottle and then hit it 3 times with a pencil in two different locations (side of the bottle, bottom of the bottle).
Suprisingly, both locations have the same component frequencies, but have different strengths depending on the two locations.  The frequencies are: 2325, 2555, 3844, 4011, and 4931.  When I hit it on the side, the higher frequencies were more predominent (mainly 3844 and 4011), whereas when I struck the bottom the lower frequency peaks were higher (2325, 2555).
The decay time is approximately .05 seconds.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>I used a cooking pan and struck the bottom several times with a spoon.  I first hit the middle of the bottom, then various places around the edges of the pan, and then in the middle again.  I wanted to see what different partials would appear if I hit different places on the pan, to see maybe if the modes' shapes could be guessed at.  When I struck in the middle, the partials 467, 930, 1764, 3339, and 4852 Hz. were present.  467 was the weakest of these and 3339 was the strongest.  The hits around the edge of the pan all showed the same partials, including all of the partials from the center hit.  In addition to the already listed partials, there was 2875, 4234, and a very faint 5778 Hz.  The appearance of new partials shows that different modes were excited along the edge of the bottom than in the middle.  You can hear this in the different tones of the two different locations.  I found the decay time for the hits to be 0.0635 seconds.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>This clip is from the beginning of the song "Love like Winter" and it came up on my iPod over the weekend.  I thought it would be fun to try to analyze the steps and to figure out what type of setup created the echo.  Analyzing the sample in Audacity, the echo appears to be a flutter echo, which means the person was walking between two flat and relatively close together surfaces.  It sounds to me that the steps are created by walking down a long hallway or corridor.  Using the formula derived in class and measuring the period in audacity to be around .003 seconds, the walls are approximately .51 meters apart.  In feet, this is only 1.7 feet which would be an extremely narrow hallway.  However, my thought is that our calculation didn't work exactly right because the person was probably walking down the center of the hallway and our calculation was for someone standing up against on of the walls.  If we double it, the hallway is approximately 4 feet which is slightly more reasonable (still narrow, though!)  </TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>When making a violin, (I used to be a violin maker) one carves the top and back of the instrument and slowly reduces their thicknesses.  As these plates get thinner one holds them at different points and taps on them at other points to hear how clearly they ring and at what pitches.  Determining the pitch can drive one crazy.  Here I recorded the tap tones of the top of a violin I am in the process of building.  The first set of taps is the top vibrating in mode 5, the second set mode 2 and the third set mode 1 (I think Alex is going to talk about modal vibrations at some point).  Looking at the spectrum plots of these tones gives a pretty good understanding of why it's so hard to hear the fundamental pitch -- there are lots of different frequencies (not in Fourier series) competing for ones attention....</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>I play a harmonic on my bass by touching the string just above the 5th fret on the A string and plucking the string. This creates a node at the 5th fret, causing the string to become a standing wave with a wavelength half as long as its entire length and with a frequency of 880 Hz. The next harmonic is played just above the 7th fret on the D string, creating a node at this location and generating a standing wave that also has a frequency of 880 Hz. I then tighten the D string, causing the frequency, and thus the pitch, of the second harmonic I played to increase. As this frequency increases while the first harmonic remains the same, we can hear beats generated that increase in frequency as the two pitches become more different. Then, I re-tune the two strings, causing the beat frequency to decrease as I loosen the D string and bring the two pitches back together. I then strike the two harmonics and loosen the D string further, again the beat frequency increases as the two notes move farther apart in frequency and decreases as they move closer together. This is the standard way of tuning a stringed instrument by ear. When the beats slow down and then disappear you know that the two strings are in tune with one another.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>On my guitar I played a series of notes to illustrate the sound and position of octaves. The first note I play is an open E (low), followed by an E one octave above, then the same on the next next, and so on - six notes paired with their respectively corresponding octaves, each pair separated by an interval of 12 equal semitones and possessing frequencies characterized by a 2:1 ratio to eachother. 
(I've been trying to complete, and am still working on, a different submission, but wanted to be sure to get one in for now)</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>I chose one of my least favorite noises, the teapot whistle.  I thought maybe I could come to like the noise more if I appreciated it on a musical, instead of purely obnoxious, level.  Analyzing the sound with audacity, I found it is composed of primarialy D9 and D8 pitches.  This is showing the 1:2 ratio of an octave.  The notes have values of 4672 Hz and 9371, very close to a perfect octave.  So my obnoxious teapot is singing a D octave.  </TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>This sound clip starts out with a sample of my bass guitar playing an A2 (110 hz).  A second later, a computer generated sine wave at 110 hz is played along side the guitar sample.  The resulting effect is a superposistion in waves, and since one can hear an oscillating hum this means there is a slight difference in the two frequencies which is forming a beat frequency to occur.  Also, by looking at the superposistion we can tell that the waves did not have the same frequency because they both constructively and destructively interfered.  This therefore shows the A string on my bass guitar is not perfectly tuned.</TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>This is the opening of the cello-piano movement of Messiaen's Quartet for the End of Time. For the first note, B4, the first five peaks were, as expected, B4, B5, F#6, B6, and D#7. When the piano enters, the spectrum analysis naturally becomes more complicated, but it is interesting to observe the difference in timbre between the piano's sound and the cello's sound. One important thing to note about the cello's sound is that there is a considerable amount of vibrato; that is, the note seems to oscillate slightly around the pitch, a fact which is shown in the plot spectrum as smaller peaks centered around the main peaks for each note/harmonic. </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is the first 10 seconds or so of Auld Lang Syne.  if you look at the frequency spectrum for the first note (from 0.7 sec to 1.5 sec),  you can see that the first 4 peaks are in the 1-2-3-4 ratio ( C2, C3, G3, C4), which is why we hear a C chord.  </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>In class, Professor Barnett jingled keys in front of the speaker and it sounded similar to bells. I think one of my favorite sounds is bells. For my first aural posting, I jingled my car keys near the speaker of my computer. I then amplified the audio track with audacity.

After learning about the frequency of sound waves and what it means to amplify a sound, I find it interesting to analyze this audio track. When I amplify it, something inside the computer vertically stretches the sound waves by the percent I indicate. It is fascintating to think sounds reduce to functions that can be manipulated by percentages to create new sounds. The frequency of this audio track is mostly between 4000 Hz and 10000 Hz. </TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is a recording of the low E string on my guitar.  Although I tuned the instrument before recording, the Audacity 'spectrum' feature is telling me I really played an F#.  Quite possible.  Regardless of the pitch, this is a good example of a function which decreases in amplitude, has a relatively visable period (especially just after the initial plucking of the string), and has a pitch which remains pretty constant.  </TD>

<TH ALIGN=left>Comment:</TH>
<TD ALIGN=left>This is me singing a pitch on the syllable "Do," which I am using to illustrate the relationship between frequency and pitch.  I determined pitch by two different methods: one by listening, and one by working with the graph of the note on audacity.

After singing the note, I compared it to a note on my tin whistle, and determined by listening that the note I had sung was G4.

I then zoomed in on the graph and determined that the length of the signal's period was in the range of .0025 to .0026 seconds.  Thus, by 1/.00255, the frequency was 392.16 Hz.  I plugged this number into our logarithmic equation, and determined that this pitch was almost exactly two semitones below A4 (-1.99), which is - as expected - G4.

Another interesting thing I noticed about the graph, pertaining to this week's material, is that - especially near the beginning, when the tone is clearest - it looks almost exactly like the graph on today's Fourier Series worksheet: the graph of g(x) = sin(200 pi t) + sin (400 pi t).

Both the graph and the clear timbre of the tone suggest that the signal's harmonic content includes one b1, and one b2.  By the relation w = 2 pi f, I would thus suggest that the function of this tone is g(x) = sin(784.33 pi t) + sin (1568.64 pi t).</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>This is an audio clip I found of 3 thunder claps in a row.  The immediate thing I noticed and found interesting about this sound clip is that it shows a periodicity of about 3 seconds.  I found it pretty amazing for nature to be so periodic when storms seem by definition so chaotic.  
The other effect I noticed in the clip is the obvious fact of the amplitude change.  Since it gets much louder when the thunder clap occurs the amplitude would increase dramatically when that happens.  The amplitude decreases rapidly after the initial "boom" of the thunder but is still fluctuating with the crackling between the claps.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=left>Here is a train whistle I recorded near White River Junction, VT, a few days ago (I was indoors so you can hear some background noise, and rumble). There's a lot going on here: there are 3 musical notes, and the chord seems to start out at C4-E4-A4, but the A4 drifts up to Bb4 by the end (moving from a minor to dominant-seventh feel, if you know harmony). I wonder why? Something to do with steam pressure changing? Each note has a harmonic series. We'll learn more about all these notes and concepts soon!
