<h1>Math 20 Homepage</h1>
<p>
<h2>Summer 1998</h2>
</center>
The basic details for the course are outlined in the description of
the course handed out in lecture on <a href="http:dayone.pdf">day
one</a> of the course.  In order to read and print this file using
your browser, you will need the Adobe
Acrobat Reader; instructions for doing this are given in the 
homework assignment "due" on the first day of class below.

<h2>Some Important Points:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Math 20 meets Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in room 102 Bradley from
10:00am to 11:05pm.  In addition, we may meet in our x-hour on
Thursdays from 12:00 to 12:50pm.  
<br><br> 
<li> 
To see the distribution of scores on the mid-term, click <a
href="http:exam1-dist.pdf">here</a>.  To see some suggested solutions,
click <a href="http:exam1-sol.pdf">here</a>.  Students with scores
below 50 should make arrangements to see me early the week of August 3rd.
<br><br>
<li>  There is a web site for the text which can be accessed by
clicking
 <a href=
"http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/probability_book/book.html">
here</a>.  Form this site you can:
<ul>
<li>
View (or even print out) the solutions to all the <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/probability_book/answers.odd.pdf">odd
numbered exercises
</a> in the text.
<li>
Download a number of the programs
mentioned in the text: <a
href=
"http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/probability_book/Maple5.4.sit.hqx">Maple5.4.sit.hqx</a>.  
In class, we'll use primarily Maple, but the
web site includes Mathematica and True Basic versions of these
programs as well.  
</ul>
<br><br>
<li>
It is recommended that you have a current version
of Maple on your Mac.  Professor Shemanske has kindly provided a 
very user friendly <a href="http:maple.html">guide</a>
 for installing Maple on your Mac.
<br><br>
<li>
I hope to meet everyone at least once in my office.  Of course, the
        best way is to visit during my <a
          href="http:office-hrs.html">office hours</a>.
</ul>
