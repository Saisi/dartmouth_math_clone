Our schedule for the remainder of the term:<br>
We have regular class meetings on Nov. 16, 18, 21, 28, 30.<br>
The x-period will meet on Nov. 29.<br>
The final exam is on Dec. 3 at 3 pm.
Tutorials will be held as usual on Nov. 27 and Nov. 30,<br>
but concerning the Nov. 27 tutorial, if no one shows up in
the first 15 minutes, Mr. Huang might leave.
</p>

<p>
There are no more written assignments.  However,
we will continue to go over new material (Sections 5.6
and 5.7), so it would be good to try and do some
of the problems from these sections on your own.
</p>


<p>
Tutorials meet on Wednesdays and Sundays
from 5 to 6 pm.<br>
The Wednesday tutorial meets in Bradley 105 and the Sunday
tutorial meets in Bradley 13.<br>
<b>Students are encouraged to attend!</b>

			<p style="text-align : justify"> Students are encouraged

			homework problems, and not how that is achieved. The honor
			principle applies to homework in the following way. <span
			style="color:#CC0000; font-weight:bold">What a student
			turns in as a homework solution is to be his or her own
			understanding of how to do the problem. Students must
			state what sources they have consulted, with whom they
			have collaborated, and from whom they have received
			help.</span> Students are discouraged from using solutions
			to problems that may be posted on the web for previous
			offerings of the course, and as just stated, must
			reference them if they use them. The solutions you submit
			must be written by you alone.  Any copying (electronic or
			otherwise) of anotehr person's code or solutions, in whole
			or in part, is a violation of the Honor Code.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align : justify">The honor principle
			applies to exams as follows:<span style="color: #CC0000">
			<b> Students may not give or receive assistance of any
			kind on an exam from any person except for the professor
			or someone explicitly designated by the professor to
			answer questions about the exam. Students may not use
			library or internet sources on take-home exam problems,
			but they may use their textbook and personal
			notes.</b></span></p>
			
			<p style="text-align : justify">If you have any questions as to whether some action
			would be acceptable under the Academic Honor Code, please
			speak to me or another member of the course staff, and we
			will be glad to help clarify things.  It is always easier
			to ask beforehand than to have trouble later!</p>
