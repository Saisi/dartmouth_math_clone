<TD ALIGN=left>This article generalizes some statistical trends of SAT scores and SAT takers. Conclusions include:<br>
1. There is large and growing gaps between black and other students on the SAT.<br>
2. There is a continuing growth in the wealth of those taking the SAT.<br>
3. There is a continued correlation between SAT scores and family income.<br>

<TD ALIGN=left>This study links liquor store sales in Ontario to violent assaults. The case for correlation seems stong, especially in light of the effects of alcohol on decision making, but its methodology may be too imprecise to establish causation - the study includes only state liquor stores and there was no followup to determine whether alcohol was involved in any assaults.

<TD ALIGN=left>Here's the interesting backstory of the "t-statistic" and "t-test", which was created by a British Chemist William Sealy Gosset who had studied chemistry and mathematics at Oxford.  Gosset created the t-statistic while working for the Guinness Beer company in Dublin, hoping to come up with a way to adequately estimate the amount of yeast to add to the brewing process so that the beer correctly fermented but did not become too bitter.

Here's a link to the abstract:

These results suprised many other scientists and they are still looking for a possible explanation.  Personally, I question the results because they do not specify the amounts of vitamins that people were taking or define what it means to have an "increased risk of dying."</TD>

Pretty interesting study (also dubious...sample of only 17 traders) that links higher testosterone levels to increased riskiness...which translates to larger profits (or losses) when investing.

<TD ALIGN=left>Some researcher have recently found out a statistically significant correlation between gene variant AVPR1a and the altruistic behavior of people. This might be a very interesting example of a correlation study, since this kind of studies will become more and more common as time goes on. Here is a link:

<TD ALIGN=left>I just read this article in the New York Times online and I thought it was interesting, although it doesn't have much statistics in it.  It's about how pot belly's have been linked to dementia:

<TD ALIGN=left>You can provide comments and suggestions about things that made you think about statistics. They can be things that you read in a newspaper or things from your personal experience.
You can also post ideas about statistical experiments that you would like to see performed in the final project.</TD>
