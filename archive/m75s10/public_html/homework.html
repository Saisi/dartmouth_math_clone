<p>

Homework assignments will be posted on this page.  The collaboration policy is much like other mathematics classes - you may collaborate on homeworks with other students, but write up your solutions in your own words.  I recommend that you try each problem out on your own before consulting others, since this is usually a more effective way to learn something from doing homework assignments. <p>
