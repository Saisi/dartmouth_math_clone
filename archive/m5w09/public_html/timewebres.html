But let him sit on a hot stove for a minute and it's longer than an hour. That's relativity." Physicists do not agree with his conclusion that "That's relativity." But the article provides food for thought.

<img src="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m5w09/smallclock4.jpg" WIDTH=35 HEIGHT=35 border=0"><a href="http://search.epnet.com/direct.asp?db=aph&jid=%22PHY%22&scope=site">Ultraslow light pulse propagation observed in atoms--both cold and hot</a>, the work of  Lene Hau, appears in Physics Today v. 52 no. 7 (July 1999) p. 17-18  1999  (journal in print in Kresge and online through the Dartmouth library. 
<BR><BR>Abstract:
Although the high density and very slow motion of atoms at nanokelvin temperatures can be exploited to drastically modify the optical properties of the atoms, ingenious methods at room temperature and above can have the same effect. In early 1999, Lene Hau of the Rowland Institute for Science and Harvard University and colleagues announced that they had slowed the speed of light pulses through a Bose-Einstein condensate to only 17 meters per second, down by a factor of almost 20 million from light's speed in a vacuum. Marlan Scully and colleagues at Texas A&M University, the National Institute for Standards and Technology in Boulder, and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics recently reported similar results using an group of atoms that, at a temperature of 360 K, are a billion times hotter than Hau's sodium atoms. Dmitry Budker and his team at the University of California, Berkeley, have witnessed even slower speeds in rubidium at room temperature.
 
<BR><BR>In commenting on this article, Professor Delo Mook has said: "As I understand this, it is just a super, super refractive index. Light is being slowed down by passage through a medium--no big deal. What is big news here is that the speed is incredibly slow. But there is nothing to undo Einstein's second postualte or Maxwell's equations. Actually the second postulate is just a special case of  the first postulate: the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames. Since Maxwell's equations predict a speed for light that is independent of the motion of the source or reciever of the light, Einstein's second postulate follows immediately. And there has never, ever been any evidence that Maxwell's equations are in error. They are the only part of "classical" physics that has survived relativity theory unscathed."

<BR><BR>The original research article was first published in Nature-- Hau, Lene Vestergaard; Harris, S. E.; Dutton, Zachary: Nature v. 397 no. 6720 (February 18 1999) p. 594-8 1999 (Nature is in print in Kresge and <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/">online back to 1997</a>).</p>
