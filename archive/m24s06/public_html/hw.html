<p>3.3 #2(a, b), 3(a, b), 4, 6, 7(a, b)<br>
For #6 note that by T<sup>-1</sup>(1, 11) they mean the <em>set</em> of 
all elements T maps to (1, 11) (since T is not 1-1 there can be no proper

<p>Section 2.5 #4, 5, 9, 12, 13</p>

<p>3.1 #2, 3, 4, 6</p>

<p align="center">Proof Assignment 6</p>

<p>Exercise 8 from 2.5.  That is, prove the following generalization of 
Theorem 2.3 (you'll want to look at the proof of 2.3 to do it):</p>

<p><b>Theorem.</b> Let T:V&rarr;W be a linear transformation between 
finite-dimensional vector spaces V, W.  Let &beta; and &beta;<b>'</b> be 
ordered bases for V, and let &gamma; and &gamma;<b>'</b> be ordered bases 
for W.  Then [T]<sub>&beta;<b>'</b></sub><sup>&gamma;<b>'</b></sup> = 
P<sup>-1</sup>[T]<sub>&beta;</sub><sup>&gamma;</sup>Q, where P is the 
matrix that changes &gamma;<b>'</b> coordinates into &gamma; coordinates, 
and Q is the matrix that changes &beta;<b>'</b> coordinates into &beta; 
coordinates.</p>

<p><b>Proposition.</b> Let V, W be finite-dimensional vector spaces and

<p><b>Due Friday, April 28</b></p>

<p>Section 2.1 #4, 5, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 26, 28, 29</p>

<p align="center">Proof Assignment 4</p>
<p><b>Proposition.</b> Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space, and 
T:V->V be linear.  Then the following are equivalent:<br>
(a) V = R(T) + N(T)<br>
(b) V = R(T) [direct sum] N(T)<br>
(c) R(T) [intersect] N(T) = {0}.<p>
<p>Hints: Be sure to explicitly state where finite-dimensionality is used.  
May want to structure this as (a) <-> (b) and (c) <-> (b), where (b) 
implies (a) and (c) by definition of direct sum (which along with + is 
defined on page 22).<br>
More hints: the only ingredients you need are the definition of direct 
sum, what equality between dimension of a vector space and dimension of a 
subspace indicates about the space and subspace, the Dimension Theorem 
(page 70 in your book) and Proof Assignment 3 with N(T) and R(T) playing 
the roles of W1 and W2.  Finite-dimensionality is a prerequisite to using 
many of those pieces.</p>

<p>Section 1.6 #2(a,b), 3(a,b), 5, 7, 11, 12, 14, 15, 22</p>

<p align="center">Proof assignment 3</p>
<p>Prove the statement of Section 1.6 #29(a) and then 29(b) as a 
corollary.  In other words, prove:</p>
<p><b>Proposition.</b> If W1 and W2 are finite-dimensional subspaces of a 
vector space V, then the subspace W1+W2 is finite-dimensional and its 
dimension is dim(W1) + dim(W2) - dim(W1 intersect W2).<br>
<b>Corollary.</b> If W1 and W2 are finite-dimensional subspaces of a 
vector space V such that V = W1+W2, then V is the direct sum of W1 and W2 
if and only if dim(V) = dim(W1) + dim(W2).</p>
<p>You may assume the reader is familiar with the definition of sum and 
direct sum for vector spaces (though it is good to say things like "to 
show V is the direct sum it remains to prove ...") and with the result 
from Section 1.3 (p. 22, exercise 23) that the sum of two subspaces is a 
subspace (so for the proposition, you need to prove the dimension 
calculation only).</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Due Friday, April 14</b></p>

<p>Section 1.2 #2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 17<br>
For #7, see example 3.  For #9 and other proofs in homework (that is, 
proofs not singled out as "the proof assignment") it need not be written 
up in a fully formal way.</p>

<p>Section 1.3 #2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 14, 20, 23, 25</p>

<p>Section 1.4 #2(a,b,f), 3(a,b,c), 4(a,b,c), 6, 10, 11, 13, 15<br>
For 6, you are working with a general F whose multiplicative identity is 
named 1 and additive identity named 0.  For 13, prove the first sentence 
as a proposition and the second as its corollary (but again, not in a 
fully formal manner).</p>

<p>Section 1.5 #2(a,c,e), 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 16</p>

<p align="center">Proof Assignment 2: prove the following and write 
up.</p>

<p><b>Claim.</b> Let W_1 and W_2 be subspaces of a vector space V.  Then 
W_1 union W_2 is a subspace of V if and only if W_1 is a subset of W_2 or 
vice-versa.</p>

<p><em>Hint:</em> do the "if and only if" in two separate directions.  One 
will be 
immediate.  For the other, try contradiction.</p>
