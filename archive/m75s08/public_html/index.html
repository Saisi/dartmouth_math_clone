<blockquote>You wake up one morning and in the half-light you
... notice that your loved one is gone and find a note on the
pillow saying `I LOVE XOU'. Almost certainly this will reassure
you, as you will assume that in the dark the Y became an X. Of
course, this is not 100 per cent certain. It is possible that
the X was intended for L and that you have been abandoned for
your close friend (or so you thought) Lou.</blockquote>

So begins the book <i>Error-correcting codes and Finite
Fields</i> by Oliver Pretzel, the book we will use as a
resource in Math 75, Applied Topics in Number Theory and
Algebra. Error-correcting codes are a relatively recent
mathematical invention; they are behind accurate cell-phone
reception and good quality CD's and DVD's. But they are just
one application of the theoretical concept of a finite field, a
topic which is close to two-centuries old in abstract algebra.
Math 75 will develop the necessary theory, and then present
applications. Besides error-correcting codes, if time permits,
we will look into other applications such as the notorious
&quot;abc conjecture&quot; and algorithmic questions of
recognizing prime numbers (including the recent sensational
test of Agrawal, Kayal, and Saxena, which was the subject of
the latter two's joint senior thesis).

<p>Lectures are MWF, from 10:00 AM - 11:05 AM in Kemeny 105.
<br>The X-hour is Thursday, from 12 to 12:50. While we will not
have normal class on the X-hour, it is likely that it will
occasionally be be used for review sessions.

If the final exam is the lowest grade, then homework, the two
midterms, and the final exam each count for 25% of the grade.

If either the homework or one of the two midterms is the lowest
grade, then that grade is dropped. In this case the other two
pre-final exam grades count 25% each, and the final exam counts
for 50% of your grade.

<P><TABLE bgcolor="#7397b0" border="0" cellpadding="2"

name="textbk"></A>Honor Code</TH></TR></TABLE><p>

On exams and quizzes <b>no help can be either given or
received</b>.<p> On <b>homework</b>, you should <b>feel free to
discuss the problems and to work together in solving them</b>.
However, the final write-up must represent your own work; <b>no
one can write up your assignment in your place, nor can you
merely copy someone else&#39;s completed assignment</b>. <p>
Homework problems are designed to be doable using the course
text, notes, and lectures. Outside references (including books
and online sources) may be used, but <b>any such references
must be cited in the final write-up</b>. Keep in mind that
while going afield for solutions is perhaps a good talent, it
is no substitute for working problems out yourself.<p> If you
have any questions as to what is or is not acceptable within
the honor code, please talk to one of the instructors. Honor
code violations are taken seriously, and any suspected breach
must be brought before the Committee on Standards. <P><TABLE

Students with disabilities who may require special
accomodations should speak to an instructor as soon as
possible. It is also advisable to stop by the <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/disability/geninfo.html">Academic
Skills Center</a> in Collis to register for support services.
<p> Also, students who have schedule conflicts with the course
due to religious observances should make arrangements with one
of the instructors as soon as possible (before the second week
of class). <hr> <a href="../../../index.html">Back
