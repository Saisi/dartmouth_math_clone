Have you ever wondered why medical schools require calculus? Or why
biology has recently been described as "the most mathematical science"?
&nbsp;Math 4/27 will show how real researchers in medicine and biology
use mathematical models to predict change and design strategies for
controlling epidemics, administering drugs, managing ecosystems.
&nbsp;Using basic calculus and a free online application, <a href="../../../~matc/eBookshelf/calculus/BigGreen.html">The Big Green Ordinary Differential Equation Machine</a><br>
you can study a multitude of real situations. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Math 4 is for students with one semester of calculus at least. &nbsp;We
use a text book developed especially for this course. &nbsp;See the
Biology Department web site for how this course fits into prerequisites
for the Biology major. &nbsp;The goal of Math 4 is to enable students
to read critically and think about the research literature in medical
and biological modeling with differential equations.<br>
<br>
Math 27 is for students with more mathematical background. &nbsp;Math
22 is a required prerequisite for Math 27. &nbsp;The goal of Math 27 is
to enable students to conduct their own independent research projects
in mathematical biology after completing the course, if they so desire.<br>
<br>
Both courses meet in the same room at the same time. &nbsp;The
difference is that in Math 4 we will prepare to read the research
literature, finally doing so around week 5 or 6. &nbsp;In Math 27 we
will be reading the research literature from the start of the course.
&nbsp;In both courses the grades will be based on 3 papers, however the
topics will be different. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Honor principle: All authors must contribute substantially to any paper
with their names on it. &nbsp;All sources must be appropriately cited.
&nbsp;Any suspicion of plagiarism will be forwarded to the COS.
