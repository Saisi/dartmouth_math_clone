Homeworks will be due in each Wednesday at the start of class (or to my office beforehand). They
will include material covered by the end of class of the Friday prior to the due date . The homework is your best chance to practice the techniques learned during the course and as such is vital if you are to understand everything as fully as possible. <br>

<br> You should only hand in the <b>required</b> problems. <br> 

Roughly once every other week, one of the homework problems will be singled out. This problem should be written up and handed in seperately from the others (again during the Wednesday class or earlier). This problem will be graded by me rather than the course grader.
 

<br>

<font color=red><b> Please note that late homework will not be accepted. </b> </font><br>

<br>

<b> Homeworks must be: </b> <br>
<li>Written up neatly and carefully on 8.5 x 11 paper. <br> 
<li>Ordered so that the grader can easily find all solutions. <br>
<li>Stapled if there is more than one sheet. <br>
<li>Clearly marked with your name. <br>

<br>

It is advised that you work in groups when solving the homework
problems. However, you should write up the final versions individually
to ensure that you understand the concepts involved. While you are
only handed in the required problems, it is strongly recommended that
you do as many of the others as possible. You should use your best
judgement for the recommended problems and concentrate on those areas
where you feel you are having difficulty.<br>


<br>


<b>Grading:</b> Most questions will be graded by an assigned course grader. Each week one question will be graded more carefully than the rest. Roughly every other week, this question will be predetermined and graded by the instructor. On the other weeks it will not be preannounced. The total each week will be 15 points. <br>
