<b> Math 23, Autumn 2004</b>: Exam information
<p><hr><p> 

<p><hr><p>
<b> Midterm</b>: The exam will have two parts. Part 1 will be an in class, closed book exam on Wed 11/3, although you will be allowed a single-sided sheet of <b>handwritten</b> notes. Part 2 is a take-home, open book exam. It will be given out on Wed 11/3 and is due in on Mon 11/8 in class (or beforehand to my office). The two parts will be equally weighted. <br>

<br>

For Part 2 you may use any books or electronic resources you wish. However you are asked not to discuss the exam with anyone else.<br> 

<br>

The homework for that week will be reduced to allow time for the take-home exam.  <br>
