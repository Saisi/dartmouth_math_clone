<I>Take from all things their number and all shall perish.</I><BR>
Isidore of Seville, ca 600<P>
<P>
<I>The best material model of a cat is another, or preferably the same, cat.</I><BR>
A. Rosenbluth, Philosophy of Science, 1945<P>
<P>
<I>Some of the men stood talking in this room, and at the right of the door a
little knot had formed round a small table, the center of which was the
mathematics student, who was eagerly talking. He had made the assertion that
one could draw through a given point more than one parallel to a straight
line; Frau Hagenstr&ouml;m had cried out that this was impossible, and he had
gone on to prove it so conclusively that his hearers were constrained to
behave as though they understood.</I><BR>
Thomas Mann (1875-1955), Little Herr Friedemann
<P>
<I>When you have eliminated the impossible, what ever remains, however
improbable, must be the truth.</I><BR>
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930), The Sign of Four
<P>
<I>A mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems.</I><BR>
Paul Erd&ouml;s
<P>
<I>When asked what it was like to set about proving something, the
mathematician likened proving a theorem to seeing the peak of a mountain and
trying to climb to the top. One establishes a base camp and begins scaling
the mountain's sheer face, encountering obstacles at every turn, often
retracing one's steps and struggling every foot of the journey. Finally when
the top is reached, one stands examining the peak, taking in the view of the
surrounding countryside and then noting the automobile road up the other
side!</I><BR>
Robert J. Kleinhenz
<P>
<I>"When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said, in a rather scornful tone, "it
means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less."
"The question is," said Alice, "whether you can make words mean so many
different things."
"The question is," said Humpty Dumpty, "which is to be master - that's all."</I><BR>
Lewis Carrol, Through the Looking Glass
<P>
<I>It is not knowledge, but the act of learning, not possession but the act of
getting there, which grants the greatest enjoyment. When I have clarified
and exhausted a subject, then I turn away from it, in order to go into
darkness again... I imagine the world conqueror must feel thus, who, after
one kingdom is scarcely conquered, stretches out his arms for others.</I><BR>
Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855), Letter to Bolyai
<P>
<I>It is here [in mathematics] that the artist has the fullest scope of his
imagination.</I><BR>
Havelock Ellis, The Dance of Life
<P>
<I>There are many questions which fools can ask that wise men cannot answer.</I><BR>
George Poly&aacute;, in H. Eves Return to Mathematical Circles
<P>
<I>The real danger is not that computers will begin to think like men, but that
men will begin to think like computers.</I><BR>
Sydney Harris, in H. Eves Return to Mathematical Circles
<P>
<I>All great theorems were discovered after midnight.</I><BR>
Adrian Mathesis, in H. Eves Return to Mathematical Circles
<P>
<I>The infinite! No other question has ever moved so profoundly the spirit of
man.</I><BR>
David Hilbert, in J. R. Newman The World of Mathematics
<P>
<I>A habit of basing convictions upon evidence, and of giving to them only that
degree or certainty which the evidence warrants, would, if it became
general, cure most of the ills from which the world suffers.</I><BR>
Bertrand Russell, in G. Simmons Calculus Gems
<P>
<I>If you would be a real seeker after truth, you must at least once in your
life doubt, as far as possible, all things.</I><BR>
Ren&eacute; Descartes (1596-1650), Discours de la M&eacute;thode
<P>
<I>God made the integers, all else is the work of man.</I><BR>
Leopold Kronecker (1823 - 1891), Jahresberichte der Deutschen Mathematiker Vereinigung
<P>
<I>Mathematicians have tried in vain to this day to discover some order in the
sequence of prime numbers, and we have reason to believe that it is a
mystery into which the human mind will never penetrate.</I><BR>
Leonhard Euler (1707-1783), in G. Simmons Calculus Gems
<P>
<I>The mathematician may be compared to a designer of garments, who is utterly
oblivious of the creatures whom his garments may fit. To be sure, his art
originated in the necessity for clothing such creatures, but this was long
ago; to this day a shape will occasionally appear which will fit into the
garment as if the garment had been made for it. Then there is no end of
surprise and delight.</I><BR>
Dantzig
<P>
[In the margin of his copy of Diophantus' Arithmetica]<I>To divide a cube into two other cubes, a fourth power or in general any power whatever into two powers of the same denomination above the second is impossible, and I have assuredly found an admirable proof of this, but the
margin is too narrow to contain it.
</I><BR>
Pierre de Fermat (1601?-1665)
<P>
<I>On two occasions I have been asked </I>[by members of Parliament],<I> 'Pray, Mr.
Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers
come out?' I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas
that could provoke such a question.
</I><BR>
Charles Babbage (1792-1871)
<P>
[On Ramanujan]<I>
I remember once going to see him when he was lying ill at Putney. I had
ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me
rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavorable omen. "No," he
replied, "it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number
expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways."
</I><BR>
Godfrey H. Hardy (1877 - 1947), Ramanujan
<P>
<I>The discovery in 1846 of the planet Neptune was a dramatic and spectacular
achievement of mathematical astronomy. The very existence of this new member
of the solar system, and its exact location, were demonstrated with pencil
and paper; there was left to observers only the routine task of pointing
their telescopes at the spot the mathematicians had marked.
</I><BR>
James R. Newman, The World of Mathematics
<P>
<I>It is nothing short of a miracle that modern methods of instruction have not
yet entirely strangled the holy curiousity of inquiry.
</I><BR>
Albert Einstein (1879-1955), in H. Eves Return to Mathematical Circles
