<b>Maple</b>:  We will be using the software package <i>Maple</i> from
time to time.  If you are not familiar with Maple, one or more of these 
pages should help get you started:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/software/mapleV5.1-mac.html">Installing Maple V5.1 on a Mac</a> (for
older machines)
<li><a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/software/maple6-mac.html">Installing Maple 6 on a Mac</a> (for
newer machines)
<li><a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/software/maple-pc.html">Installing Maple on a PC</a>

</ul>

<P>

<b>Grade</b>: Your grade will be determined as follows:

<PRE>
Category                 Weight         
----------------------------------     
homework and quizzes      15%            
two mid-term exams        25% each       
final exam                35%                                                  
</PRE>   

<p>

<b>Exams</b>:  The date, time, and format of all exams are yet to be
determined.  

<p>

<b>Makeup policy</b>: Homework will be assigned (almost) every class
period, and will be due at the next class meeting.  <i>No late
homework will be accepted for any reason</i>, but your three lowest
homework scores will be dropped before computing your grade.  Thus you
may miss up to three homework assignments without penalty.

<p>

Makeup tests will only be given in case of legitimate emergencies.  

<p>

<b>Tutorial:</b> At this point, it seems unlikely that there will be a tutorial for math 14.  More information
as it becomes available.

<p>

<b>Honor policy</b>:
<ul>
<li>Collaboration is encouraged during the process of
thinking about homework problems, but is not acceptable while writing
up your final solutions.  That is, working together on homework is
fine, but copying is not.  
<li>No collaboration of any form is acceptable during exams.
</ul>

<p>

<b>Students with disabilities</b>:  Any student with a documented disability needing academic adjustments or
accommodations is requested to speak with the professor by the end of the second week of the term.  All discussions
will remain confidential, although the Academic Skills Center may be consulted to verify the documentation fo the
disability.
