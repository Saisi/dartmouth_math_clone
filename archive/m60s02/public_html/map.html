Here is some help regarding down loading maple 7 to a 
<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/software/maple7-mac.html"> Mac </a>
and here is some help for loading it onto a 
<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/software/maple-pc.html"> PC </a>.

Here is the program we used to  in order to  explore the 
<a
href="temps/ProbD11.html"> flipping  </a> of a fair coin on the
first day of class. <b> Note:</b>the below flipping program is a bit
more sensibly
organized and the program CoinToss has  different output. 
After loading and running this template you can explore  the 
associated   <a href="temps/ExpEx1.html"> Expected Values  </a> and <a
href="temps/VarEx1.html"> Variance   </a> that arise in this setting.


<hr>
Here is a program for displaying the
<a
href="temps/Histogram1.html"> histogram   </a> associated to a list of
data.

Here is a cleaned up template for exploring the 
<a
href="temps/Flipping1.html"> flipping  </a> of a fair coin.  
In particular <b> it contains  the CoinToss program necessary in order to
run the
below Streak program </b>.  
<hr>
<p>

Here  is program which will analyze the <a href="temps/Streaks1.html">
streaks   </a>  that one witnesses when  flipping a coin.  Notice to
analyze the list you will need to use  the above Histogram program.  

<hr> 

<p>

Here  is program which will analyze a  <a href="temps/Standarize1.html">
standardized   </a> sum.  Here is a program to remind us how to
<a href="temps/ExperimentalVar1.html">
experimentally  </a> compute the variance.

<hr> 

 Here is a program where we explore the<a
href="temps/CLTStreak1.html">
 central limit theorem </a> via our
maximal streak random variable. 
<hr>

 Here is a program where we explore the<a
href="temps/Competion1.html">
 hypothesis  </a> testing.
