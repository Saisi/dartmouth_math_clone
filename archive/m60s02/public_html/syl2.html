<H1> Probability  (<a

Syllabus</H1>
</CENTER>


Math 60  is an introductory  course on probability.
The course will have two components an exploratory simulation based
component where we will explore several interesting advanced probability
ideas and a more "down to earth" traditional component where we will
familiarize ourselves with the basics of mathematical probability.
One of the main goals of the exploratory aspect of this course is to leave
with you with tools that will enable you to  set up and simulate your own
probability experiments.  In the process of developing these tools we will
take a look into some interesting advanced topics ideas like Brownian
motion, streak theory and stochastic differential equations. In the "down
to earth part of the course" we will
 introduce to the  basic  mathematical
concepts  used in probability and in the process 
develop a consistent way to articulate and interpret  the results
of our  simulations.  In order to accomplish this we will be 
covering chapters 1-9 of this <a

book</a> (scroll down to see the table of contents).
