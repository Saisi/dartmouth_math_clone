<h2>Math 60  Log</h2>
<hr>
<b> Week 1 (March 27-29) :</b>
<p>
<b> Wednesday :</b>For the first couple weeks we will be introducing some
probabilistic
concepts via experiment.  You will need to simulate probabilistic
phenomena to do this.  I recommend using maple.  Here is some help
regarding down loading maple 7 to a 
<a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/software/maple7-mac.html"> Mac </a>
and here is some help for loading it onto a 
<a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/software/maple-pc.html"> PC </a>. 
Here are the templates from the first lecture.  First we looked at the
<a
href="temps/ProbD11.html"> flipping  </a> of a fair coin, then we
analyzed
the  <a href="temps/ExpEx1.html"> Expected Value  </a>, and hopefully  by 
Friday we will explore the <a
href="temps/VarEx1.html"> Variance   </a>.  Your first assignment is
essentially to
redo these experiments for an unfair "coin", one whose  probability 
of turning up  heads is not 1/2 (you should pick your own probability of
the coin turning up heads and perhaps experiment with a few different 
values). 
The assignment is to analyze the random
variable which is one if the coin turns up heads and -1 if it turns up
tails.  Assignment: first make claim about what the expected value of the 
random variable should be  in this setting  
and then experimentally justify your claim via a computer
simulation. This assignment also must
include a paragraph or so describing the sense in which your experiments
help justify your claim!  
<p>
For an example of an unfair "coin" I recommend
going to the Math 40 class (at 1:45 in Bradley 105)  where pennies will
be spun rather than flipped. 


<p><b>Friday:</b>
Today we explored the notion of expected value a little more carefully and
in particular the expect length of a <a
href="temps/Streaks.html"> streak  </a>  when flipping a coin.  We also
explored the <a href="facts/1FMP.html"> First Fundamental Mystery of
Probability  
</a>.

<p> 
Homework.  Problem  1.  (To be turned in) Work out
approximately how
many shots a basketball player attempts in a season and a approximate  
the average percentage of these attempted shots that are made.  Modify the
streak program to
simulate the streaks that a "random basketball" players will experience.  
Write a paragraph arguing how you might determine  whether  basketball
players behave randomly or not.
<p>
 Problem  2.  (To be turned in)  Perform the survey  described in class on
5 people.

<b> Week 2 (April 1-5) :</b>
<p>
<FONT COLOR="RED" FACE="Arial, Monoco">
X-Session in Berry Starr 274
</font> form 12:00-12:50 on Tuesday April 2nd.  
We will talk about Monday's homework which is the first example of
modifying a template in a meaning full way.  Attendance is optional, but if
you have limited or no programming experience you will  probably  want
to attend this X session.

<p>
<b> Monday.</b>  
Today we explored the notion of variance and
in particular 
explored the <a href="facts/2FMP.html"> Second  Fundamental Mystery of
Probability
</a> and the <a href="facts/3FMP.html"> Third   Fundamental Mystery of
Probability
</a>.

<p>

Homework: 1.(to be turned in) Examine the standardized sum of an unfair
coin toss (as we did for the standardized fair coin toss  - see the <a
href="temps/Standarize1.html"> standardized   </a> sum program).  How does
the empirical distribution appear to  compare to the normal curve as the
number of tosses in each  experiment gets larger? Recall: this will
require observing that the variance of the underlying random variable is
4*p*(1-p) which can be
 <a href="temps/ExperimentalVar1.html">
experimentally  </a> verified. 

<p>
2. (to be turned in)  Simulate the expected value of the longest
streak of successes  as opposed to  the expected value of the longest
streak. Compare the expected length of a success streak with that of a
streak and formulate a conjecture about the
relationship between these two expected values.  Discuss the   empirical
evidence that lead you to your for your conjecture.   

<p>
<b> Wednesday </b>:  Today we saw the the <a href="facts/CLT.pdf">
  Fundamental Theorem of
Probability
</a> and explored a bit about what it means to   statisticians.  
We did this via the  <a href="temps/CLTStreak1.html">
 maximal streak  </a> random variable.

<p>
  Your homework  will
be to perform the same analysis we performed for the streak random
variable for 
the following random variable: imagine that  each of the plus and minus
ones that  we
see after our fair coin
toss  corresponds to a dollar amount that we
receive or owe. We play this game N times.  After each time we play 
we either owe some amount, are breaking even or we are ahead.  For
example N=4 and  we "flipped" the payoffs 
{-1,-1,-1,1} in that order then after the second toss we owe 2 and
after the third toss
we owe 3.   Simulate the random variable which corresponds to counting
the number of times during the experiment  when
you are ahead.  For example for with our {-1,-1,-1,1} flips we are never
ahead
and the result would be 0.  Pick an M and look at the
standardized sum representing  the performing this experiment  M
times.  Experimentally verify that this
random variable is becoming normal as M is getting larger.  
<p>
The homework should be turned in on <FONT COLOR="RED" FACE="Arial,
Monoco">  <b> MONDAY!!!!! </b> </font>.  If it is turned
in via email please call it LastnameHW4, or example <b> I </b> would call
my maple assignment LeibonHW4 and if I had a PC 
I would send my professor the file  LeibonHW41.html and a
bunch of gif images that were located in the image folder after
saving my program as html.
<p>

A <b> Question:</b> The assignment says:
Simulate the random variable which corresponds to counting the number of
times during the experiment when you are ahead.
Does this mean the total number of times you are ahead, or the number of
streaks when you are ahead?
<p> 
The <b> Answer:</b> the total number of times you are ahead.
<p>
<b> Friday </b>:  Today we explored how a good understanding of the
big square root can lead to a dramatically improved version of the <a
href="temps/RW.html">
 calculus.

<b> Monday.</b>
Today we saw that the the exponential and geometric distributions <b>
are </b> the memoryless distributions. Do Friday's homework for tomorrow
and look over chapters 6 and 8.
<p>
<b> Wednesday</b>
Extra credit announcement.  Up to ten extra credit points will be added to
your exam scores provided you turn in a "mini-project". A
"mini-project" might  consist of the following three parts.  1. questions
2.  simulations  designed to
explore your questions and a  3.  conjectured answer based on your
simulations
and any other form of reasoning. You may work with other people on this
"mini-project" if you'd like. (A VERY terse example of a
"mini-project": 1. It is
clear to me that if I take the bus waiting problem and make the 100
minute wait longer then I should  get closer to the "integral value".  But
what if if make the  time smaller?  When it is 0 I know the answer is
ten, but how does it decrease to its eventual integral value as time gets
larger?...  2. Now I simulate
this experiment with the uniform on [5,15] distribution for various times
from 0 to 100 and I plot the expected
waiting times....  3. From my simulation, and especially my plot,  it
appears that one approaches the integral value very quickly.   In fact it
looks like an exponential curve with a negative exponent....) 
<p>
Please read chapter 6 carefully  and look over chapter 8, turn on Friday
numbers 14 and 20 from 6.1 and do and turn in if you'd like numbers 6 and
19 form 6.1.
