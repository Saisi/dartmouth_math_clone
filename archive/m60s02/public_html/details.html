<h2>Math 60  - Probability - Spring  2002</h2>

<p>
<b> Text: </b> <IT>
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/">Introduction
to Probability</I></a>, (second Edition), by Grinstead and Snell. 
</IT>
<p>
  
<b>Grade</b>: Your grade will be determined as follows: 
a midterm exam (30%), a final exam (40%),  Homework (10%), 
and a small project (20%). 

<p>

<b> Homework:</b> 
Homework assignments can be found in the 
<a href="hw.html"> homework
log</a>. Homework assignments will always be broken into two parts,
the to be turned in part and the optional to turn in part.
You should always do all the problems and turn any thing you are not
confident about so that you can get some feed back on it. The in class
half of the exams we be comprised mostly of slightly modified homework
problems so before the exams you should make sure you understand how to do
all the problems assigned form the book. 


<p>

<b>Exams:</b> The midterm and final will each have two parts.  The in 
class part which will be comprised mostly of slightly modified homework
problems, book examples and class examples.  You may also be asked to do
routine tasks like state definitions and theorems. The take home part will
be a collection  of more challenging problems and will
determine  70% the  grade associated to the exam.
<p>
<b> Project:</b>  The best way to learn probability is to do probability
and this project will give you the opportunity to  do some
probability.  You will
be asked to simulate a probability question of your own.   Suggested 
topics  the meaning 
of this admittedly rather vague request   will be provided. 

<p>

<b> Honor policy:</b>  Collaboration is encouraged during the process of
thinking about homework problems and your projects. In fact if you would like 
to work on your projects in small groups thats fine with me. However <b> 
no </b> 
collaboration of
any form is acceptable during exams, and (expect when explicitly stated on
the exam) the use of any references other than your
class notes and our book is not acceptable. 



<p>

<b> Students with disabilities:</b> I encourage students with
disabilities,
including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases and learning
disabilities, to discuss with me any
appropriate accommodations that might be helpful.
