<P>
This course will provide an introduction to algebraic structures known
as groups, rings and fields, complementing your knowledge of vector
spaces from linear algebra. We will investigate properties of these
structures and maps between them with a focus towards classification.
Homework problems will be both computational and theoretical.

</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Homework assigned on consecutive  Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays is
due <B>in class</B> on following Wednesday.  Thus, for example,
homework assigned September 22 and 24 is due Wednesday, September 29.</TD>
<P>
<LI>Homework is to be written <B>neatly</B> using one side of 8 1/2 x
11 inch paper.  Do <B>not</B> use paper from a spiral notebook unless
you can tear off the ragged edge.  All papers are to be stapled.
<P>
<LI>
Use <B>English</B>.  If you can't read your solutions aloud as
fluently as if you were reading your textbook, try usings nouns and verbs in your writeups!
<P>

<LI>Late homework will not be accepted in the absense of divine
intervention or matters of similar weight.</TD>
<P>
<LI>While homework is collected weekly, it is assigned daily so that
you can work on it daily since many of the problems you consider will
require reflection.  Moreover, lectures assume that you have at least
begun to assimilate the ideas presented in the problems.  In other
words, waiting until the last moment to do your homework will be
detrimental to your understanding and measured progress; but of
course, the decision is yours :-).

<TD><B><BIG>Honor Principle</B></BIG>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<UL>
<LI>I <B>encourage</B> you to talk to and exchange ideas with other students.
Reach a consensus about a probable proof or counterexample to a
problem.  <B>Then</B> write your solutions up by yourself.  Also,
<B>be sure</B> to give credit to anyone who provided you with a clever
insight or idea.  Aside from being intellectually honest, this will
quickly point out to you ideas you don't fully understand, and
indicate things for you to review.


<P>
<LI>For exams, all work must be your own.  Take home portions of exams
will be open book and notes.
