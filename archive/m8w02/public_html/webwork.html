<h2>WeBWorK and Math 8</h2>
 </center>
  
<blockquote>
  <p></p>
  <p>  </p>
  <h3> I. What is WeBWorK ? </h3>
  <em>WeBWorK</em> is a system that allows students to do their homework in
an interactive web-based environment.  <br>
  <br>
 Using <em>WeBWorK</em>, students may try to answer homework problems more
than once.  After each try, a message appears telling the student whether
the answer is correct or not.  This provides immediate feedback to the students,
allows them to discover what they did wrong, and hopefully allows them to
understand the topic of the question better. <br>
 <br>
 Each <em>WeBWorK</em> problem set is individualized. Each student has a
different version of a problem generated from a fixed template; for example
the numerical values in the formulas may be slightly different). 
  <p></p>
  <p>  </p>
  <h3> II.  How anybody can try out WeBWorK</h3>
  <p></p>
  <p>  Anyone with an internet connection can try out WeBWorK by following 
the directions in Part III below. Use <strong>practice1</strong> as the <strong>
login name</strong> and <strong>practice1</strong> again as the <strong>password</strong>
. To see different problems, you can login as practice2, practice3, or practice4
and use the login name for the password.</p>
  <p>  </p>
  <h3> III.  How to use WeBWorK to do your homework</h3>
  <p></p>
  <p>    Using <em>WeBWorK</em> is quite simple.<br>
     Below are the basic steps on how to get started.<br>
  <br>
   <strong>NOTE:</strong> Most pages of <em>WeBWorK</em> also contain   directions.
 Therefore, if you are ever unsure of what you should   do, try reading the
directions and descriptions on the page at which   you are looking.<br>
   </p>
  <ol>
 <li>You can use any computer with a browser like Netscape or MSIE.  In general,
it is not possible to use a text-based browser like lynx since most of the
mathematics is rendered using a  graphic format.   </li>
    <li>Open Netscape and go to the   main <em>WeBWorK</em> page, address 
  <a href="http://webwork.math.rochester.edu/">   </a>
      <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/webwork/">http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/webwork/</a>
.    </li>
    <li>On that page you will see names of current <em>WeBWorK</em>   courses.
 Find the name of your course and click on it.  </li>
    <li>This   will get you to the main page of your course.  This page includes 
  necessary information about logging in.<br>
 To log in, click on the   'Login' button.  </li>
    <li>This will take you to a login page.  Enter your   login name and
password, and click on the 'Continue' button.<br>
   Your <strong>login name</strong> is the usually just your last name, 
 followed possibly by a digit for people in the class with the same   last
name (e.g. smith, smith2, ...)). Possible exceptions include   compound last
name like "den Hartog" or "De La Huerta" which would   be rendered Hartog
and Huerta respectively.    <br>
 Your initial <strong>password</strong> is (unless you gave me   something
else) your six-character student ID ``number''. </li>
    <li>If   your login is incorrect, you will be told so, and you can return
to   the login page and try again.  </li>
    <li>If you are   registered for the course, you should receive and email
from your   instructor confirming your login and password.   <br>
 If your login is   correct you will see a page where you can do following: 
   
      <ul type="">
   <li><strong>Look at and do the problems in a set via Netscape.</strong><br>
      To do the first days assignment, for example, click on the line in 
 the box that starts with 'setw02day1'.  Then click on the 'Do problem  
set' button.<br>
 On each line in the box, where all the sets are   listed, after the set
number, you can see whether the set is open or   closed.  If the set is open,
that means that when you solve a   problem, it will be counted towards your
grade.  If the set is   closed, you can still solve problems, but your results
will not be   recorded.  <br>
 After the indication of whether the set is open or   closed, there is additional
information about the due date (if the   set is open), or whether the answers
are available (if the set is   closed).    <!-- 
When the answers are available, you have the option of
  looking at correct answers when viewing a problem.
-->
         </li>
        <li><strong>Get a printout of the problem set.</strong><br>
 To print   out setw02day1, for example, first choose the download type.
 The   default of pdf is probably what you want, although you may have to 
  configure your browser to use Adobe's Acrobat Reader to view (and   print)
the files.  If you want to work with postscript, you can save   it to your
desktop and (on a mac drag it to a printer icon). To view   postscript, you
will need to install ghostscript (see the <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/software">software</a>
 page on the Mathematics Department's   web site.   <br>
 After choosing one of the download types, click on the line in   the box
that starts with 'setw02day1...'.  Then click on the 'Get hard   copy' button.
A couple of things may happen at this point.  If your   browser is set up
to handle pdf documents, your browser window will   fill with the homework
set in it as a document.  In this case, go to   the icon 'file' and choose
the 'print' option.  If your browser is   not properly configured, you may
get an alert message asking what to   with the file.  In this case, you can
save the file to disk (so that   you can print it at a later time), choose
an application to view or   print the file (e.g. GSview or dropPS for postscript
or Acrobat   Reader for pdf).  Any of the computer consultants show be able
to   help you with this kind of problem.   
          <p>           </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Look at a summary of your WeBWorK homework   scores.</strong><br>
 This is the second section of the page.  If you   click on the button 'Get
Summary', you will see your current scores   for all available problem sets.
 </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      </li>
    <li>If you are printing out a problem set or looking at a summary of 
 your homework scores, you are done.  If you are viewing a problem   set
via Netscape, you will see a page with the problems in the set   you chose.
 To view and/or answer a problem, click on the number of   the problem and
click on the 'Get Problem' button.  Notice that   there are three modes of
viewing the problem: 'text',   'formatted-text' and 'typeset'.  It is best
to view the problem   using 'typeset' mode, which should be the default.
Once you choose a   problem and click on the 'Get Problem' button, you will
see the text   of the problem with boxes for your answers.  Enter your answers
and   click on the 'Submit Answer' button.  If you are working on a   problem
set that is already closed, you will have the option to see   the correct
answer or a solution if one is available (currently only   a few problems
have solutions available).  To see the correct answer   and/or solution,
just check the box(es) and click on the 'Submit   Answer' button (you do
not have to enter an answer to see the   correct answer or solution).  Once
you have submitted an answer, you   will be told whether your answer is correct
or not.  If not, you can   try again.  After you've tried a problem, you
can either go to the   next problem, the previous problem, or see the list
of the problems   again.  </li>
    <li>If you want to check the status of your problems   (e.g. to double
check that your answers have been recorded), use the   "Prob. List" button
at the top of the page to see the   problem list page.  </li>
    <li> When you are finished, log out using the   "Logout" button at the
bottom of the page.  </li>
    <li>That's   all, folks!      </li>
  </ol>
    
  <h3> IV.  Important facts to know </h3>
  <p></p>
  <p>    </p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>What to do if you have problems with WeBWorK:</strong><br>
   
      <ul>
        <li>If you have a problem logging in, contact your instructor.  
        </li>
        <li>If you have a problem printing out a set, ask a consultant  
at a  computer lab.  If you don't get sufficient help,   contact your instructor
or TA.     </li>
        <li>If you have questions on specific homework problems or if you
have   comments about <em>WeBWorK</em> that you think can help us   make
          <em>WeBWorK</em> better, click on the 'Feedback'  button on any
of the pages of <em>WeBWorK</em>.   </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
    <li>If you are logged on to <em>WeBWorK</em> for longer that 30 minutes
   without any activity,   you will be asked to log in again.  This is a
security measure.  You   can resume your work after you logged back in. 
All your results from   the last log in will be saved.     </li>
  </ul>
