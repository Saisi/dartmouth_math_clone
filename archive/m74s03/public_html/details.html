<p><b>X-Session</b>:  The X-sessions will play a crucial role in this 
course.  At each X-session we will meet and students will be randomly 
asked to describe their attempts at a solution to a selected homework 
problem. <b>Grade</b>: Your grade will be determined as follows: a 
midterm exam  (30% of your grade), homework (30% of your grade),  and a 
final exam (the remaining  40% of your grade).  <p><b>Class Log:</b>   
The homework assignments and exam due dates  will be posted in the class 
<a href="hw.html"> log.</a>  <p><b>Honor Principle</b>: On the exams, 
no help is to be given or received. On the homework, collaboration is 
permitted and encouraged.  <p><b>Students with disabilities</b>:  I 
encourage students withdisabilities, including "invisible" disabilities 
like chronic diseasesand learning disabilities, to discuss  with me any
appropriate accommodations that might be helpful.<p><b>PRELIMINARY 
Syllabus</b>:This class will cover several topics in combinatorial, 
algebraic and geometric topology.In particular, we will cover various 
topics in Knot Theory (see the Knots Knotes for details), we will classify 
surfaces (see the ZIP proof) and we will classify the covering spaces of 
a nice topological space (see chapter one of Hatcher).  To accomplish 
these goals,  we  will need to carefully develop the notion of 
the fundamental group of topological space.
