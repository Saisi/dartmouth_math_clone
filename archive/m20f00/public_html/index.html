Textbook</h3>
Introduction to Probability (Second Revised Edition) by Charles M. Grinstead
and J. Laurie Snell
<p>This book makes frequent references to programs that are available on
the web. I'll be using the Maple
<br>versions, but they are also available for Mathematica and TrueBASIC.
You can find all of them at <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/book.html">http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/book.html</a>

<h3>
Exams</h3>
There will be 1 midterm exam and a cumulative final exam. The exams will
(tentatively)
<br>have two parts: an hour long in-class part and a take-home part. You
may not consult with
<br>anyone but me on either part of an exam. You will not be able to use
your book, notes or
<br>calculator on the exams unless it explicitly says so on the exam .
Tentative dates for the
<br>midterm exams are as follows.

<p>The Registrar's Office schedules the final exam, which will occur during
the period
<br>December 2 - 6. If you must make travel plans before the schedule for
final exams appears,
<br>do not make plans to leave Hanover before December 7.&nbsp; Exams will
not be given early to
<br>accommodate travel plans.

<h3>
Homework Policy</h3>
There will be homework assignments due each week. You may (you are encouraged
to) worktogether on the homework assignments. However, the work you turn
in should be your own.&nbsp; This means that after whatever
<br>discussions you have about the problems, you should write up your own
solutions in your own words. If you work with someone else from the class,
please list their names at the top of your assignment.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h3>
Grades</h3>
The exams, homework, and final exam all count equally toward your grade.

<h3>
Disabilities</h3>
I encourage students with disabilities (of any kind; including ``invisible''
disabilities like chronic diseases,
<br>learning disabilities, or psychiatric disabilities) to discuss with
me after class or during my office hours
<br>appropriate accomodations that might be helpful.&nbsp; Students with
disabilities who will be taking this course
<br>and may need disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged
to make an appointment to see
<br>their instructor as soon as possible.&nbsp; Also, they should stop
by the Academic Skills Center in Collis Center to register for support
services.
