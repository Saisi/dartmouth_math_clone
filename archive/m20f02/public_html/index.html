It   is a revision of an earlier book written by the second author and published   by McGraw Hill. This revision is published by the American Mathematical Society.   This book can be purchased at the AMS bookstore. </p><p>We will also keep the book on the Web. </p><p>You can download the book in <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/book.pdf">Adobe   Portable Document Format (pdf)</a>. For this you will need the free <a href="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html">Acrobat   Reader </a> and make this a helper for pdf documents. (Note that you must have   version 3.0 or later of the Acrobat Reader.) For reading on the screen we recommend   that you set the magnification to 125%. Our book emphasizes the use of computing   to simulate experiments and make computations. We have prepared a set of programs   to go with the book. We have Mathematica, Maple, and TrueBASIC versions of these   programs. You can download the programs from this location. We also have experimental   versions of the programs written for us as <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/bookapplets/index.html">Java   applets</a> by Julian Devlin. Please contact us if you have any trouble obtaining   or running these programs. The answers to the odd-numbered problems are available   from this website. </p><h3 align="center">Remarks about the course:</h3><h3 align="center">Instructor: Jim Baumgartner</h3><h3 align="center">Office: 105 Choate House</h3><h3 align="center">Office hours: Tuesdays and Thursdays 4-5</h3><p align="left">I am often available at other times and I am happy to meet with   you if there is no other interference.</p><h3 align="center">Exams: 2 midterm, 1 final</h3><h3 align="center">All exams will be take home, equal value.</h3><h3 align="center">Classroom: 105 Bradley</h3><p align="left">Our homework grader is Jonathan Wakelin.
