Ties are allowed.&nbsp;The set of such rankings is called a "profile."&nbsp; We seek a functionfrom the set of profiles to group rankings that is supposed to representthe collective rankings of each profile.&nbsp; Here are the propertiesthat the function is required to satisfy:<p>Axiom 1.&nbsp; The group ranking should be a weak order.<p>Axiom 2.&nbsp; The function should satisfy monotonicity.<p>Axiom 3.&nbsp; The function should satisfy Pareto optimality.<p>Axiom 4.&nbsp; The function should satisfy independence of irrelevantalternatives (IIA).<p>Before explaining these axioms, just a few comments.&nbsp; Arrow’s originalpaper was in 1949.&nbsp; Since that time he revised it some, and lots ofpeople have reformulated the axioms to suit themselves.&nbsp; Three formulationsare in some of the reserve book readings.&nbsp; You are encouraged to lookat Olinick, Roberts, and Luce and Raiffa.<p>Axiom 3, Pareto optimality:&nbsp; If all rankings in the profile arealike, then the group ranking is the same as these rankings.<p>Axiom 4, Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives:&nbsp; To determinewhether x is preferred to y in the group ranking you need only considerhow x is ranked relative to y in the profile—i.e., any modification ofthe profile that keeps the ranking of x and y unchanged will yield thesame group ranking of x and y.<p>Axiom 2.&nbsp; Monotonicity:&nbsp; If two profiles are the same exceptthat in the second one, candidate x is ranked higher than in the first,and if the group ranking for the first profile has x ranked above y, thenthe second ranking must also have x ranked above y.&nbsp; Thus, if x isa winner, moving x up in a voter’s ranking shouldn’t cause x to lose.<p>Axiom 1.&nbsp; Weak order:&nbsp; A ranking is a weak order if it istransitive, antisymmetric, and complete.&nbsp; (Complete to a combinatorialistis the same as "connected" to a logician, i.e., given any candidates xand y, each voter must prefer&nbsp; x to y, y to x, or be like them equallywell.)<p>In the proof we define the term "decisive set" of voters.&nbsp; Givena set of voters and a set of candidates, a set Dxy of voters&nbsp; is adecisive set for candidate x over candidate y means that for any profilein which all voters in Dxy prefer x to y, then in the group ranking x ispreferred to y.<br>&nbsp;</body></html>
