<p>

<!-- Course Description information -->
This course will introduce the student to several topics in finite mathematics including sets and counting, logic, graph theory, game theory, and voting theory.  A major goal of this class is to give students confidence in talking and writing about mathematics.  We will spend roughly two weeks on each of the five topics.

</table>
<p>

<!-- Class Participation information -->
It is important for students to come to class prepared and ready to participate.  Students should aim to ask at least one question or make a comment in <b>every</b> class period, and preferably more than one.  Attendance is particularly important on days that are dedicated to group work, as every student will be expected to participate actively in his or her assigned group.

<br>

<!-- Homework policy separator -->
<table bgcolor=#7397b0 border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 width=100%>
<th align=left><A NAME="hw"></a>Homework Policy</th>
</table>
<p>


<!-- Homework policy information -->
There will be two types of homework assigned in this course.  Two days a week, problem sets will be assigned and posted in the homework section.  One day a week, a worksheet will be handed out in class.  Students will work together in groups on the problems on this worksheet, however every student must write up his or her own work.  Student solutions to these questions should be written in complete sentences and submitted on a separate sheet.  All homework assignments will be due just <b>before</b> the following class.  That is, problem sets assigned Monday and Wednesday will be due before class on Wednesday and Friday, and  worksheets assigned on Friday will be due before class on Monday.  <b>LATE HOMEWORK IS NOT PERMITTED FOR ANY REASON.</b>  The grader is permitted to give a grade of 0 on any homework that is not neat and stapled.  Take pride in your work!
<br>
<br>
Problem sets will be graded on a scale of 0-2 as follows:
<ul>
<li>0 means major errors and/or little to show
<li>1 means significant errors and/or partially complete
<li>2 means substantially complete and correct.
</ul>
Worksheets will be graded on a scale of 0-5 based on completeness, clarity, and accuracy.

<p>

<!-- Project separator -->

<th align=left><a name="project"></a>Project</th>
</table>
<p>

<!-- Project information -->
In a course where one can only catch a glimpse of each topic before it is time to move onto the next, this project is intended to give the student the opportunity to delve a little more deeply into a topic which interests her or him.  Every student is expected to submit a writing project on a subject which is related to one of the topics covered in this course.  This work should be comparable to a section in a textbook (or a lesson plan) in that it includes exposition, pertinant definitions, examples, and relevant applications.  
<br>
<br>
Students will be expected to hand in a brief project proposal which includes the topic they plan to research and a list of resources.  This project proposal is due on <b>Friday, May 14th</b>.  The project is due on <b>Friday, May 28th</b>.
<br>
<br>
An x-hour will be scheduled around the middle of the term for an informal discussion of possible topics for projects.  Students are strongly encouraged to set up an appointment with the instructor to discuss areas of interest.

</table>
<p>

<!-- Honor Principle details -->
Collaboration on homework is permitted and encouraged, but obviously
it is a violation of the honor code for someone to provide the answers
for you.  In other words, you should feel free to talk to other students while 
thinking about a problem.  However, when it comes time to write up your solutions, 
you should do this by yourself and without outside assistance. 
<p>

Tutorial assistance for this course, that is, help with your homework,
will be available in 102 Bradley, Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays
evenings 7 - 10pm.  Tutorials will begin on Thursday, September 26.
<P>

Also note that the Tutor Clearinghouse will have private one-on-one
tutors available for Math 8.  The tutors are recruited on the basis
that they have done well in the subject, and are trained by the
Academic Skills Center.  If a student receives financial aid, the
College will pay for three hours of tutoring per week.  If you would
like to have a tutor, please go to 301 Collis and fill out an
application as early in the term as possible.
