First homework is due.Write up the problems through Problem 15 to turn in. The mandatory problems are2,4,7,8,9,10,14,15. If you are not familiar with mathematical induction, startreading Appendix B on mathematical induction and do as many problems from thatappendix as you can. If you find you are having trouble with functions, you maystart working on the appendix on relations but if you are relativelycomfortable with functions, just skip that appendix. When we do a problem inseveral different ways in class, turning in multiple solutions done in class tothat problem won't count for extra credit! It is when you or your group findsextra solutions independently that they count for extra credit. After thisfirst assignment you will also start getting homework problems from thesupplementary problems for the chapters, problems that have not been discussedin class. However, the majority of the homework will consist of problems fromthe main text, and we will discuss many, probably most, of the problems fromthe main text in class. Turn in the problems in a notebook, using the table ofcontents page you can download from the website to make a table of contents. Ifyou don't have a table of contents, I can't grade the notebook, because I won'thave a place to put the grades. Please look over the material in the notesthrough Problem 27 for our class discussion on Thursday.</p><p>Wednesday, Jan 16: Second homework is due. Write up problems 16 through 33to turn in. Problem 19 is optional, though if we have time later on, we willcome back to it. The mandatory problems are 16, 18, 20, or else start workingproblems in the appendix on mathematical induction, 24, 27, 29, 30, 32, 33. Thefeedback form has been revised. Print it out and get feedback from otherstudents on your solutions to the non-mandatory problems. There is a three-holepunch available in the math department office; you may use it to punch holes inthe feedback forms so you can put them with your problems in your notebooks.</p><p>Friday, Jan 18 Please be prepared to discuss the problems through Problems42-50. Problems 43 and 44, which are based on Problem 42, are intended to giveyou a bit of a stretch, so you might want to start with Problems 45-50.</p><p>Monday, Jan 21:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No class,Martin Luther King Day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Classmoved to X-hour at 8.45 Thursday.</p><p>Wednesday, Jan 23:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please beprepared to discuss problems 51-56.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Please turn in problems 34-50.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The mandatory problems are Problem 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 43 (the phrase&quot;the y-axis&quot; should be replaced by &quot;the line x=n&quot;), 46, 49,50.</p><p>Friday, Jan 25.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was asense in class that some people would like to attack the next set of problemsinstead of jumping forward into induction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So please read the section on Ramsey numbers and be preparedto discuss problems 58-62.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Youíllfind that they dovetail nicely with the problem we were working on in class onThursday.</p><p>Monday, Jan 28.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please readChapter 2 through Problem 71 and be prepared to discuss the problems throughProblem 71.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Chapter 2 is availablefrom the web site, as is the current draft of the entire book.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The file containing the whole book doeshave an index if you are beginning to have trouble finding definitions, etc. </p><p>Wednesday, Jan 30.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please turnin problems 51-71.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The mandatoryproblems are 54, 56, 57, 59, 65, 66, 68 (which you may have already done aspart of Problem 21), 69.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Eventually I would like to see Problems 62 and 71, but it isunreasonable to expect everyone to get them this week.</p><p>For Friday Feb. 1, Please look over problems 74-78 and 83-85 and be preparedto discuss them in class.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also ourmid term should probably be sometime next week.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Think about whether it would be better for you to have it inthe X-hour or to have it some evening (most likely Wednesday).</p><p>For Monday, Feb. 4, Please look over problems 86 to 95 and 97.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My Monday office hours are going toneed to be at 3 instead of 4 because the department has a faculty candidategiving a talk at 4:00.</p><p>For Wednesday, Feb. 6, Please turn in problems 74-78, 83-85, 86-95 and 97.The mandatory problems are 78, 84, 86, 89, 91, 92, 94, 97 (Hint to saving somework: note that #(G) is 1 if G is a tree, and that you can compute #(G)directly if G is a tree with extra edges. You might or might not run intoloops, edges from a vertex to itself, in working the problem, depending on howyou do it. Notice that a loop is never in a spanning tree, so you can deleteloops as soon as they arise in computing spanning trees.) Problem 94 is likelyto require a fair amount of thought, so although it is mandatory, I won'texpect to see it on Feb. 6.</p><p>Thursday, Feb 7, Class in X-hour at 8:45. Please go over the review at thebeginning of Chapter 3 and Problems 100-110 and be ready to discuss them inclass. </p><p>Friday, Feb. 8 no class &quot;carnival holiday.&quot;</p><p>Monday, Feb. 11, Please look over problems 111-123 and be prepared todiscuss them in class. </p><p>Wednesday, Feb. 13,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please turnin problems 100-123.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The mandatoryproblems are 102, 107, 108, 109, 111, 114, 115, 117, 119, 120.</p><p>Thursday, Feb. 14, 7:00PM Mid Term Exam (You will have until 9:00 if youneed the time.)</p><p>Friday, Feb. 15,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please lookover problems 124-135 and be ready to discuss them in class.</p><p>Monday, Feb. 18,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please lookover problems 125-127 and 129-140 and be ready to discuss them in class.</p><p>Wednesday, Feb. 20,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please turnin problems 124-127 and 129-140.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The mandatory problems are 124, as revised <ahref="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/Desktop%20Folder/Problem124revised.pdf">here</a>, 126, 127, 129,131, 134, 135, 138. If you are planning to get to Problem 203 by the end of theterm, continue through problem 148 with Problem 144 and 146-148 mandatory. </p><p>Friday, Feb. 15,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>please workyour way through problems 141 to 149, reading the material on pages 65-67 asyou go. If possible, I would like us to be able to introduce Problems 150 and151 in class on Friday, because they are tricky to understand but easy once youunderstand them. If you are trying to get to Problem 203, I recommend that youtry to get to at least problem 154. As a group you will want to decide whetherto skip over problems 155 to 161 and come back to them if you have time afteryou get to 203. If you do want to do problems 155-161 for next Wednesday, Isuggest you work on them simultaneously with doing problems 164-174simultaneously, partly because most of them are pretty straightforward.</p><p>Monday, Feb. 25,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please look overproblems 149-154 and 162-174 and be ready to discuss them in class. If you aretrying to get to Problem 203 by the end of the term, I suggest that you try toget to problem 183. That will give you a chance to finish off 155-161 if youwant to.</p><p>Wednesday, Feb 27,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please turnin Problem 131 as revised <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/Desktop%20Folder/Problem131revised.pdf">here</a>,Problems 141-154 and 162-170.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Themandatory ones are Problems 144, 146, 147, 148, 151, 153, 165, 166, 168,170.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you are trying to get toProblem 203, I suggest you turn in Problems 149-154 and 162-183.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The mandatory ones are 151, 153, 165,166, 168, 170, 173, 174, 175, 177, 180, 182. </p><p>Friday, March 1,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please lookover problems 171-83 and be ready to discuss them in class. If you are tryingto get to Problem 203 by the end of the term, I suggest that you try to get toProblem 195.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(There is a lotof algebra in Problems 196-203.)</p><p>Monday March 4, If you are not trying to get to Problem 203, download thesimplified version of Chapter 4 that was posted around noon Saturday and lookover problems 191-201.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you aretrying to get to Problem 203, look over Problems 196-203, using the version ofChapter 4 you already have.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If youwant to work on problems 155-161, now is the time to do it!</p><p>Wednesday, March 6.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the newversion of Chapter 4, please turn in Problems 171-183 and 191-201.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The mandatory problems are 173, 174,175, 177, 179, 181, 193, 194, 198, 201.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>If you are trying to get to Problem 203, please turn in Problems 184-203in the old version of Chapter 4. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Inthis case, the mandatory problems are 173, 174, 175, 177, 179, 181, 185, 186,189, 193, 194, 201, 203.</p></div></body></html>
