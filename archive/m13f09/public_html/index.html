<p>
Homework will consist of two parts:  
<ol>
<li>    Webwork:  this is an online homework system that gives you immediate feedback 
concerning the correctness of your responses.  
The webwork homework must be submitted online by 11:00 on the due date; the system does not permit late submission.  
Please see the this document (link coming soon) for information about how to use webwork. Each webwork assignment
is worth approximately 3 points.
<li>    Written homework: Typically, about two problems will be assigned from the text each class. The problems will
be posted in the <a href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m13f09/hw.html">Homework Assignments</a> section of the webpage.
Please show your work fully. The written homework from the previous week will be due every Friday. Each written homework is worth
ten points, and each assignment will be scored on a scale of 0 to 10.
</ol>
    In addition to the assigned homework problems, you will find the class time much more beneficial if you read 
the material in the text in advance of each lecture.  
It is very helpful to try working some of the homework problems in advance of the lecture so that you have a good 
idea of where the difficulties lie. 
You are strongly encouraged to do additional problems for practice.
</p>

<p>
Late homework will be reviewed, but you will recieve a score of 0.  
</p>

<p>
Collaboration on homework is permitted and encouraged, but <b>all homework is to be written up independently!</b>

There is one graduate TA, Asa Levi.

The Tutor Clearinghouse has organized study groups for this course, and private one-on-one tutors are also sometimes available for Math 13. 
 The tutors and study group leaders are recruited on the basis that they have done well in the subject, and are trained by the Academic Skills Center.  

Study Groups for this term will meet as follows:<br>
<br>
Sunday 4-5:30 PM in Kemeny 006<br>
<br>
Monday 7-9 PM in Kemeny 006

<p>
We encourage any students with disabilities, including 
"invisible" disabilities such as chronic diseases and learning disabilities, 
to discuss appropriate accommodations with us, which might help you with this class, 
either after class or during office hours. Dartmouth College has an active program to 
help students with disabilities, and we are happy to do whatever we can to help out, as appropriate.
<br><Br>
The Student Disabilities Coordinator, Nancy Pompian, can be reached at 6-2014 
if you have any questions. Any student with a documented disability requiring 
academic adjustments or accommodations is requested to speak with their instructor by the end of 
the second week of the term. All discussions will remain confidential, although the 
Academic Skills Center may be consulted to verify the documentation of the disability 
and advise on an appropriate response to the need. It is important, 
however, that you talk to one of us as soon, so that we can make whatever arrangements 
might be needed in a timely fashion.
<br><br>
Whether or not you have a disability, the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/">Academic Skills Center</a>
is an excellent place to visit. 
Take some time to look at their videos and other resources. 
Would you benefit from some of the planning tools? Do you think you could improve your note-taking skills? 
Is stress eating your life? You're the only one who knows what might benefit you, and it doesn't hurt to look.</p>
