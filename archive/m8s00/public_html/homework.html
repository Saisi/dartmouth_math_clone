<ul>
<li>Review Chapters 1 - 5 (as necessary) 
<li>Skim Sections 17.1 and

<li>Work the problems on the supplementary sheet handed out in
lecture. (Not to be handed in!!!) To access the class demo run in lecture on Monday, 
<a href="demos.html">click here</a>.
<p>
If you didn't pick up a copy in class (<b> or even if you did</b>),
you can print your own copy as follows.  If you are printing to a
postscript printer (e.g. a Kiewit printer), choose the <A
HREF="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m8s00/hw1sup/hw1.ps"><B>postscript</B></A> version, download it to
your hard disk, and then drag it onto your desktop printer icon.
Alternatively, choose the <A HREF="hw1sup/hw1-pdf.pdf"><B>pdf</B></A>
version.  The pdf version will probably print in all cases, and is
viewable via Acrobat Reader.  There are notes about handling pdf files
in the Maple notes which you are to read below.
<li> Familiarize
yourself with our webpage.  Note that all future assignments will be
give via this page and <b>not</b> handed out in lecture.  Also be sure

<LI>
A tank contains 1000 liters of pure water. Brine that contains 0.05
kg of salt per liter of water enters the tank at a rate of 5 liters/min.
Brine that contains 0.04 kg of salt per liter of water enters the tank
at the rate of 10 liters/min. The solution is kept thoroughly mixed
and drains from the tank at 15 liters/min. How much salt is left
in the tank<BR> 
<B>(a)</B>after t minutes?  <B>(b)</B>after 1 hour?</LI>
<LI>Into a 2000 liter container is placed 1000 liters of a brine solution
