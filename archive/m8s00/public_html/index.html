<H3><FONT COLOR=red>Important Notes About the Final:</font></h3>
<ul>
<!--
<li>
<FONT COLOR=red>Our second exam is scheduled for <b>Wednesday, May 10, from
4:00 - 6:00 pm in 101 Bradley</b>.</FONT> You are responsible for material
covered since the first exam through Friday's, May 5th, lecture.
Some important notes about the exam: 
 <OL>
 <li>The solutions to the problems in the first two Matrix handouts
 (the assignments that were due May 5th and May 8th) are available in
 <b>pdf</b> format <a href="./handouts/matricesSolutionsNew.pdf">here</a>
 and in <b>html</b> format <a href="./handouts/matricesSolutionsNew">here</a>.
 <li>You need not worry about estimating the error when using Taylor
 polynomial approximations. 
 <LI>Calculators are not allowed. You will  not need one for the exam. 
 <LI>You are permitted to bring along an 8.5-by-11 piece of paper 
 with any notes written on it (both sides) that you want. You 
 must write it out on your own.  Do not make a copy of someone else's, 
 because that would be a violation of the Honor Code. 
 <LI>Practice exams from previous Math 8 courses may be found 
 <A href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m8f99/exams.html">here</a> 
 and <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m8w00/exams.html">here</a>. 
 Doing some more odd and even-numbered problems in the book is good 
 practice for the exam, too. 
 </OL>

<li>
The 2000 Spring Final Examination Schedule has now been released. Our final
exam has been scheduled for
<b>Friday, June 2nd, from 8:00 - 10:00 am in 111 Wilder</b>.
To remind everyone what was stated on the handout
distributed on the first day of classes (and is clearly stated on the
class "General Information" webpage), I quote: <b>No early exams will
be given to accommodate  over-optimistic travel plans.</B>
</li>
<li>Some further details:
<ol>
 <li>While the emphasis of the final exam will be on material covered
 since the last test, this emphasis will <b>not be exclusive</b>. Questions
 concerning material covered at any point during the term could appear on
 the final. So review (and make sure you understand) your first two exams!
 <LI>Calculators are not allowed. You will  not need one for the exam. 
 <LI>You are permitted to bring along an 8.5-by-11 piece of paper

are available in
