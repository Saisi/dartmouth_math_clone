<h1>GENERAL COURSE INFORMATION FOR MATH 8</h1>
<p>
<h2>Homework Policy:</h2> Written homework will be assigned daily and
will be due before the next class meeting. Homework will be turned in
to and picked up from the boxes outside of the lecture hall. Late
papers will not be graded. Missing papers count zero. Moreover,
neatness counts; if the grader can't read your paper, you get no
credit.

Homework will be graded on an 0 - 2 point scale: 2, mostly correct; 1,
about half correct, 0; mostly incorrect or missing. Homework scores
will be used only in helping to determine borderline grades, although
there is a very strong correlation between those who do not do the
homework regularly and those who receive low exam grades.
<p>
<h2>Tutorials:</h2> To assist you with the homework and the course in 
general, there will be evening tutorials every Tuesday, Thursday, and 
Sunday from 6:00 to 8:00 pm in 102 Bradley Hall. 
Tutorials will begin on <b>Thursday, March 30</B>.
<p>
<h2>Exams:</h2> There will be two mid-term exams and a final exam.
The mid-term exams will be given on
<b>Wednesday April 19th</b> and <b>Wednesday May 10th</b>. The
final will be given at a time and place during the exam period
(<B>June 2nd - June 6th</B>) to be scheduled by the
Registrar's office.  <B>No early exams will be given to accommodate 
over-optimistic travel plans.</B>

Students having conflicts with the mid-term exams should contact their
instructor early to try to resolve them.
<p>
<h2>Grading:</h2> Your grade in the course will be determined
primarily from the total points obtained on the three exams.  Homework scores 
will be used only to resolve borderline cases.

<p>
<h2>The Honor Principle:</h2> On exams: No help given or received.
<p> 
On homework: Collaboration is permitted and encouraged, but NO
COPYING . In other words, you should feel free to talk to other
students while you are in the process of thinking about a
problem. However, when it comes time to write up your solutions, you
should do this by yourself without outside assistance.
<p>
<h2>Special Needs:</h2>
Students with
special needs or disabilities should contact me as soon as possible so
that we can arrange appropriate accommodations.
