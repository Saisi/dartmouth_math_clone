<p>
  
<b>Grade</b>: Depending on which total grade is higher, your 
grade will be determined either as  
 homework  (10% of your grade),
2 midterms exam  (30% of your grade each),  
and a final exam  (the remaining 30% of your grade)
<bf> OR </bf> homework  (10% of your grade),
2 midterms exam  (20% of your grade each),
and a final exam  (the remaining 50% of your grade). 

<p>

<b>Exam Times:</b> Two  exams will be held on the evenings of 
October 14 and November 11 
from 6-8 p.m.. Our final will be on Tuesday <a 
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/calendars/exams/04-05.html">December 
7th</a> at 11:30 a.m.  (Joint Math Exam).  
You are  expect to be  free  at these times and must discuss 
any  legitimate  conflicts  with  one of us <b> during the first week of class</b>.     

<p>

<b>Class Log:</b>   The homework assignments and exam  dates  can be 
found in the  class <a href="syl.html"> log.</a> 
Your homework  will only be graded  if 
we can find your name and the assignment's number on it.  If you intend to turn in  
multiple pages, then these pages <bf> must </bf> be stapled together.  
Homework will <bf> never 
</bf>  be accepted late, and any assignment not turned in on time will 
be recorded as a zero. However,  you will be allowed to drop your
three lowest homework scores. 

<p>

<b>Honor  Principle</b>: 
On the exams, no help is to be given or received.
On the homework, collaboration is permitted and encouraged, but NO COPYING . In other 
words, you  should feel free to talk to other students while you are in the process 
of thinking  about a problem. However, when it comes time to write up your solutions, 
you must do this by yourself without outside assistance. 

<p>

<b>Students with disabilities</b>:  We encourage students with
disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases and 
learning disabilities, to discuss  with us  any
appropriate accommodations that 
might be helpful.

<p>

<b> Tutorial Sessions </b>: 
There is a tutorial session every Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday from 7-9 where you can 
receive advice on the course material (except during Thanksgiving break). 

<p>

<b> Study Group </b>:   <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/tutors/join.html">Study group</a>
are available for this course through the academic skills center. 

<p>

<b>X-Session</b>: We will be scheduling 2  X-Hours in order to make room 
for three  (optional) review lectures, one for each of the three exam
(see  the <a href="syl.html">syllabus</a>). 

<p>

<b>Rough Syllabus</b> (<a href="syl.html"> Detailed Syllabus </a>): 
This course is a sequel to Mathematics 3 and is appropriate for students who have 
successfully completed an AB calculus curriculum in secondary school. Roughly half of 
the course is devoted to topics in one-variable calculus: techniques of integrations, 
areas, volumes, trigonometric integrals and substitutions,
sequences and series including Taylor series.

<p>

The second half of the course generally studies scalar valued functions of several 
variables. It begins with the study of vector geometry, equations of lines and 
planes, and space curves (velocity, acceleration, arc-length). The rest of the course 
is devoted to studying the differential  calculus of functions of several variables. 
Topics 
include limits and continuity, partial derivatives, tangent planes and differentials, 
the Chain Rule, directional derivatives and applications, and optimization problems 
including the use of Lagrange multipliers.
  
<p>

<b>Alternatives: </b> There are several alternate ways to satisfy the  
Math 8  requirement that may better suit your needs.  You should consider 
them.  They are:
<p>
  <a 
href="../../../m11f04/public_html/index.html">Math 
11</a>: Math 11  is a course designed for students who find that through 
October  20th of  our course <a href=                             
"syl.html">syllabus</a> that our course looks entirely like  review (the 
equivalent of two terms of AP  credit based  upon  the BC exam or the  
permission of a Math 11  instructor 
is required).
<p>

 <a href="../../../m15f04/public_html/index.html">Math 
15.1</a>:  Math 15 is a course fine tuned 
to the needs of the Physics 15 and 13 student (this course has the same 
prerequisites as  Math 8).
<p>

<a
href="../../../m9f04/public_html/index.html">Math
9</a>:  Math 9 is an honors version of Math 8 with an emphasis on proof 
(This  course can be taken by invitation of the Department Chair  or with 
the permission of a Math 
9  instructor).
