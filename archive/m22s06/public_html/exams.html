EXAM</span>.&nbsp; The final exam will given at the time and place
scheduled by the Registrar: Friday, <span

11am in 102 Bradley Hall</span>.&nbsp; TAKE NOTE, the exam is not in
our usual classroom.&nbsp; The exam will cover all material covered in
class through Wednesday's lecture on May 31st.&nbsp; There will be no
"take-home" portion, and the format will be
a blend between the in class and take home portions of the first two
exams.&nbsp; The exam will be closed book.</span><br>

 style="font-weight: bold;">SECOND
EXAM.</span>&nbsp; The second exam will be given on Thrusday, May 11th
during our x-hour.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as with the first exam, the exam
will be in two parts.&nbsp; The first
will be the in-class portion and will be objective in nature.&nbsp; I
will ask for <span style="font-style: italic;">precise statements
of
<span style="font-weight: bold;">definitions</span>, theorems from
lecture or the text and direct applications
of what we have studied</span>.&nbsp;
The second will be the take-home
portion which will include problems that are more computational or
which require more thought or time and which would not be appropriate
in a 50 minute time slot.&nbsp; You are not expected to spend more than
two hours on the take-home portion, but no time limit will be imposed.<br>
<br>
</big><big style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Your work, and especially
your
work on the take-home, is expected to be
well written and clear.&nbsp; Unsupported assertions usually will
receive little or no credit.<br>
<br>
The first exam will cover all
material covered in lecture and in the
readings up to and including Monday's lecture (on sections 5.1 and 5.2
of the text).&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">(Recall that we
also covered and had homework on part of section 5.4!)</span>&nbsp;
Naturally, the emphasis will be on the material covered since the first
exam.&nbsp; However, it may be necessary to use concepts and techniques
from the material covered on the first exam.<br>
<br>
The exams have been graded and will be returned in class on Monday. </big><big
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">(College regulations forbid my putting
the exams in the homework
boxes.)&nbsp; Students who are unable to pick their exams up on Monday
will have to come by my office to get their exams.&nbsp; Although it is
still premature to assign grades, I have done so to give you an <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">appoximation</span>
of where you stand based on the total on your first two exams and your
homework to date.&nbsp; The homework has been scaled to a score out of
50.&nbsp; I have written your total and homework score on your exam --
as well as your approximate grade.&nbsp; For reference, the ranges (out
of 100 + 100 + 50 = 250) are:<br>
</big>
<ul style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
  <li>A: 220-250</li>
  <li>B: 185-220</li>
  <li>C: 150-185</li>

EXAM:</span> The first exam will
be given on Thursday, April 20th
during our x-hour.&nbsp; The exam will be in two parts.&nbsp; The first

text).<br>
<br>
By popular request, I have posted
some sample problems for the first exam <a href="exam1-prac.pdf">here</a>.&nbsp;
I posted these to <span style="font-weight: bold;">supplement</span>
your preparation for the
exam.&nbsp; Partial solutions

<span style="font-weight: bold;">The
exams have been graded and will be returned in class on Monday.</span>&nbsp;
(College regulations forbid my putting the exams in the homework
boxes.)&nbsp; Students who are unable to pick their exams up on Monday
will have to come by my office to get their exams.&nbsp; It is a bit
premature to assign
grades so early in a course, but I know that you may want an idea of
where you currently stand, so I have made a crude stab at <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">approximate
grades</span> based on your exam score and your homework score (from
the first three assignments).&nbsp; It seemed appropriate to score the
homework out of 35, so your homework totals have been scaled to a
number between 0 and 35,&nbsp; I wrote this score and your total score
on the front of your exam as well as a letter grade.&nbsp; Let me
emphasize again that this letter grade is just an approximation and
shouldn't be taken too seriously.&nbsp; On the other hand, it does give
an indication of where you stand currently.&nbsp; For reference, the
ranges are (out of 135 = 100 + 35):<br>
</big>
<ul style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
  <li>A: 113-135</li>
  <li>B:&nbsp; 95-113</li>
  <li>C: 80-95</li>
  <li>D: &lt;80</li>
