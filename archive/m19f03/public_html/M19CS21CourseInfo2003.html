</span></b><span style='font-weight:normal'>Theteaching method for the course is based on student group discussion of problemsin class for about half of each class period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These group discussions are followed by whole-classdiscussions which explain the ideas behind the problems and amplify onthem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is a good bit ofresearch that shows students retain more information when they &quot;construct&quot;their own understanding of it in some way; the teaching method is designed tofoster such constructions while covering the material in discrete mathematicsthat computer science students need to know.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Interviews of students from earlier offerings of this coursefound that students believed at the end of the term that trying to solveproblems that introduced ideas before the ideas were presented in class washelpful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Most students felt thatworking on these problems in small groups contributed to theirunderstanding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not all studentshave felt this way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Whiledifferent students learn in different ways, it is Professor Bogart's opinionthat students who did not find small group work helpful either did not try hardenough to make the groups work for them or were matched with people who did nottry hard enough.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It will bepossible for the composition of the groups to change from day to day, and theformation of the groups on any given day will be based in large part on studentchoice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore the student whowants to try to get the benefits of group work should be able to do so.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously it is difficult toparticipate in a group if you don't come to class, so regular class attendanceis strongly encouraged!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It hasbeen difficult for students who come to class late to catch up with whatevergroup they join, and it disrupts the flow of ideas in this group.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus for reasons of self interest andcommon courtesy, it is especially important to come to class on time.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>Although the reasons for group work are based on research inlearning, it is worth mentioning that people responsible for hiring in businessusually put very high priority on a recruit's ability to function as part of ateam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>The exact timing of the exams willdepend on when we have covered a relatively complete body of material.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The exams will be designed to take onehour, but they will be scheduled in the evening so that students can take up totwo hours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This gives studentstime to make and correct mistakes, and to think through how to do a problemwhen they are taking a different (and perhaps more difficult) approach than theinstructor intends!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
