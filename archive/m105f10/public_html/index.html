			<p style="text-align : justify">This course is an
introduction to algorithmic number theory.  Emphasis will be on primality testing,
factoring, and discrete logarithms.  We will also discuss algorithmic aspects
of finite fields.
</p>
			 
<p>
There is no required text, but a resource will be ``Prime numbers: a computational
perspective", by Richard Crandall and Carl Pomerance.

			<p style="text-align : justify"> Collaboration on
homework is definitely allowed and even encouraged.  However,
it is tempting to think that you understand something that was figured out
by your friend.  When you hand in a solution, you should know it well enough
that you could explain it to others.  Please name others you worked with
when handing in homework papers.              Merely copying (electronic or
			otherwise) of another person's solutions, in whole
			or in part, is a violation of the Honor Code.</p>

			<p style="text-align : justify">I encourage any students

			as chronic diseases and learning disabilities, to discuss
			appropriate accommodations with me, which might help you
			with this class, either after class or during office
			hours. Dartmouth College has an active program to help
			students with disabilities, and I am happy to do whatever
			I can to help out, as appropriate.</p>

			<p style="text-align : justify">The Student Disabilities
			Coordinator, Nancy Pompian, can be reached at 6-2014 if
			you have any questions. Any student with a documented
			disability requiring academic adjustments or
			accommodations is requested to speak with me by the end of
			the second week of the term. All discussions will remain
			confidential, although the Academic Skills Center may be
			consulted to verify the documentation of the disability
			and advise on an appropriate response to the need. It is
			important, however, that you talk to me soon, so that I
			can make whatever arrangements might be needed in a timely
			fashion.</p>
