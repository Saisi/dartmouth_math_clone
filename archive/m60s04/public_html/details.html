<h2>Math 60  - Probability - Spring  2004</h2>

<p>
<b> Text: </b> <IT>
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/">Introduction
to Probability</i></a>, (second Edition), by Grinstead and Snell. 

</IT>
<p>
<b>Grade</b>: 
Your grade will be determined as follows: 
a midterm exam (20%), a final exam (40%),
homework (10%), Quizzes (10%), and a small project (20%). 

<p>

<b> Homework:</b> Homework assignments can be found in the 
<a href="hw.html"> 
homework log</a>.  There will be two types of homework problems: those to 
be 
turned in  (labeled DUE in the homework log) and the routine ones of which 
one 
will be randomly 
selected every  Friday and made into a quiz (labeled ROUTINE in the 
homework log). 
 
<p>

<b> 
Project:</b>  The best way to learn probability is to do probability
and this project will give you the opportunity to  do some
probability.  You will
be asked to simulate a probability question of your own.   
Suggested  topics and  the meaning 
of this admittedly rather vague request   will be provided. 

<p>

<b> Honor policy:</b>  Collaboration is encouraged during the process of
thinking about homework problems and your projects. In fact, if you would 
like  to work on your projects in small groups thats fine with me. However 
<b>  no </b> collaboration of
any form is acceptable during exams, and (expect when explicitly stated on
the exam) the use of any references other than your
class notes and our book is not acceptable. 


<p>

<b> Students with disabilities:</b> I encourage students with
disabilities,
including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases and learning
disabilities, to discuss with me any
appropriate accommodations that might be helpful. 
<p>

<b> Syllabus </b>: Math 60  is an introductory  course on probability.
The course will have two components: an exploratory simulation based
component where we will explore several interesting advanced probability
ideas and a more "down to earth" traditional component where we will
familiarize ourselves with the basics of mathematical probability.
One of the main goals of the exploratory aspect of this course is to leave
with you with tools that will enable you to  set up and simulate your own
probability experiments.  In the process of developing these tools, we 
will take a look into some interesting advanced topics (things like 
Brownian
motion, streak theory and stochastic differential equations). In the "down
to earth" part of the course we will introduce to the  basic  mathematical
concepts  used in probability and, in the process, we will 
develop a consistent way to articulate and interpret  the results
of our  simulations.  In order to accomplish this we will be 
covering chapters 1-9 and 11 of this <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/">
book</a> (scroll down to see the table of contents). Hence, this  book's 
table of contents could be used as more detailed syllabus.
