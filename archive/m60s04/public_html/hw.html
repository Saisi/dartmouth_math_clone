On Friday last week's simulations are due. <b> Comments:</b>
Feel free to use whatever  language you want (Maple, C++, Java, ETC...) to 
produce you simulations.   If you use a language other than Maple, then  
please 
briefly explain what you intended for your code to do.   You will turn in 
three things for each problem: (1) the code, (2) the  simulations results, 
and (3) the conclusions you made based on these simulations.  You can 
either (1)  Blitz these components to me,  (2) print them out and turn 
them in, or (3)  post them on a web site and send me the URL (this last 
option would be the most convenient for me).
