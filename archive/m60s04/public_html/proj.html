<p>
Pick a question involving probability that has piqued your interests 
and research it's answer.  
In  all likelihood this will involve simulation. I encourage you to pick a 
topic close to your heart, and to talk with me if you are unclear whether 
your ideas are feasible.  Some examples are: 
<p>
Question: What is a good model for card shuffling? Using such a model can I 
explore the effect of shuffling on the playing of various games?
<p>
Question: Can I make a model for traffic at the corner of Wheelock and 
Main street?  
 Using this model can I explore possible ways to optimize traffic flow 
through Hanover?
<p>
Question: The first digit of randomly constructed numbers in nature often 
satisfy  the Benford distribution. How can can I explore this claim?

I would appreciate these being turned on or before  the last day 
of classes (Wednesday June 2).
