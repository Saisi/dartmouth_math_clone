<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Exams</h3>
There will be a midterm exam and a final exam.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may
use your book, notes and homework on the exams.&nbsp; They will be very
much like the homework.
<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Homework Policy</h3>
Homework will be assigned each week, due the following week.&nbsp; During
the quarter, each of you will present a homework problem at the board.
<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Grades</h3>
The exams will count for 25% each, the and the homework will count for
50% of your grade.
<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">The Honor Principle</h3>
Every student who matriculates at Dartmouth agrees to abide by the academic
honor principle.&nbsp; You have an obligation to act with integrity in
your own academic work, and to take action if you observe honor code violations
by others.&nbsp; Academic integrity is essential to the scholarly enterprise
and we take it seriously.
<p>In Math 3, you are encouraged to work together on homework problems,
and to use professors, other students, other textbooks, and generally any
resource you can find that will help you understand and work the problems.
You must write up the homework solutions by yourself in your own words.
In brief, collaborate but don't copy.
<p>You must do all work on exams independently, without giving or receiving
assistance of any kind.
<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Special Concerns</h3>
Please talk to us as soon as possible, or whenever something comes up,
about any special concerns you have about the class.&nbsp; If you have
a disability and may require disability-related accommodations, talk to
us as soon as possible; this includes invisible disabilities like chronic
diseases, learning disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities.&nbsp; If
you have athletic or other extracurricular commitments and hope to accommodate
them (for example, by taking midterms at alternative times), talk to us.&nbsp;
If you are ill and fall behind on work, talk to us.&nbsp; If you are in
any way concerned about the course or your performance in it, talk to us.
If you can't do the homework, go to the tutorials, or talk to us. Make
an appointment, either after class, by phone or via blitzmail, if you can't
make regular office hours.
