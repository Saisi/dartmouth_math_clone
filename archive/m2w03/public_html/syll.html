<b> Textbook: </b> <br><br>
<i>Calculus with Applications,</i> by Varberg and Fleming  
<br> The text is available at Wheelock books as a reader. 

<p>
<b> Do These Quickly: </b><br><br>
At the beginning of the first class of each week, the class will begin with a series of problems that should take the first few minutes of the class period.  The intention of these problems is to remind you of material in your mathematical background that will be used in the week's lectures.  We intend the problems to take a few minutes and expect you to finish them outside of class if you find you do not have enough time.  These problems will not be collected and are solely for your benefit.  If  you are finding the problems difficult we encourage you to come see us during our office hours or to discuss the problems with one of the tutors.

<p>
<b> Homework:</b> <br><br>
Homework will be given every class period except Friday and will be due at the BEGINNING of the following class.  <b>LATE HOMEWORK IS NOT PERMITTED FOR ANY REASON.</b>  However your two lowest homework grades will be dropped to allow for missed assignments.  Expect to spend approximately three hours working on homework outside of class for every hour spent in class.  Homework submitted on more than one sheet of paper should be stapled, not attached with a paperclip.  <b>MESSY OR UNSTAPLED HOMEWORK WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</b>

<p>
<b> Problem of the Week: </b><br><br>
Assigned each Monday, the Problem of the Week (PotW) will be a harder problem dealing with the material covered in that week.  They are to be turned in before the quiz for that week.  Whereas we hope that you will work with each other on the homework, we strongly encourage that you work with your classmates on the PotW.


<p>

<b> Exams:</b>

<br>

<br>

There will be two exams during the quarter in addition to one final
exam. 
<b>IT IS DARTMOUTH POLICY THAT FINAL EXAMS ARE NOT SUBJECT
TO RESCHEDULING SO PLEASE DO NOT MAKE YOUR PLANS TO LEAVE CAMPUS UNTIL
THE REGISTRAR HAS ANNOUNCED THE SCHEDULE FOR FINALS.</b>

<p>

Hour exam 1:  Monday, January 27, 4:00-5:00 p.m. (Bradley 101) <br>
Hour exam 2:  Monday, Febuary 17, 4:00-5:00 p.m. (Bradley 101) <br>
Final exam:  Wednesday, March 12, 10:30-12:30 p.m. (Rocky 3)<br><br>


<b> Weekly Quizzes:</b><br><br>

There will be a short quiz at the end of the last class of the week (usually Friday.)  The quiz will cover the material from that week and will contain problems similar to those on the homework. <b> MISSING CLASS ON THE DAY OF A QUIZ WILL RESULT IN A SCORE OF ZERO ON THAT QUIZ.</b>

<p>

Quizzes will be given on Friday of each week, except for the week of Winter Carnival.  That week the quiz will be given on Thursday, February 6th due to Winter Carnival.

<p>

<b> Office Hours:</b>

<br>

<br>

We encourage you to visit during office hours if you have any questions,
need help with homework problems, or would just like to talk about the
material.  See above for times.

<p>


<b> Grading: </b> 

<br>

<br>

Your final letter grade for Math 2 will be determined by the fraction of 520 possible points you earn.  The components of the total score are: 

<br>

<br> Hour Exam 1:  100

<br> Hour Exam 2:  100

<br> Final Exam:  150 

<br> 8 Quizzes: 80  (10 points each)

<br> Homework:  50 (2 points each)

<br>  Problems of the Week:  40 (5 points each)

<br> Total:  520

<p>

The 25 homework assignments will be graded given 0, 1, or 2 points as follows:

<br>

<ul>

<li>0 means major errors and/or little to show,

<li>1 means significant errors and/or partially complete,

<li>2 means substantially complete and correct.

</ul>

<p>

<b> Tutorials: </b> <br><br>
Tutorials will be scheduled for four nights a week, Monday-Thursday 7-9 pm in Gerry 104.  The tutors are 
<a HREF="mailto:Anna.Frantz@Dartmouth.Edu">Anna Frantz 03</a>, <a HREF="mailto:Thomas.Zangle@Dartmouth.Edu">Thomas Zangle 05</a>, <a HREF="mailto:Erik.Jacobson@Dartmouth.Edu">Erik Jacobson 04</a>, and <a HREF="mailto:Leigh.Vicens@Dartmouth.Edu">Leigh Vicens</a>.

  Tutorials are optional, but you are encouraged to use them to work on the homework or for help with the course material.  Additionally, the tutors are available on a limited basis to provide individual help to students who feel they need it.   

<p>
<b> Honor Principle: </b>
Dartmouth students are expected to adhere to the honor principle.  In this course, that means that while homework can and should be worked on and discussed with others, the work you hand in must be your own.  No copying!  All exams will be closed book and closed notes, and obviously no collaboration is allowed on exams.  Calculators are <b> NOT </b> permitted on exams.  

<p> <b> Special Needs: </b>
Any student with a disability for whom special accommodations would be helpful is encouraged to discuss this with the instructor as soon as possible.
