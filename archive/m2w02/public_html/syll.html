<p>
<b> Homework:</b> <br><br>
Homework will be given every class period except Friday and will be due at the BEGINNING of the following class.  <b>LATE HOMEWORK IS NOT PERMITTED FOR ANY REASON.</b>  However your two lowest homework grades will be dropped to allow for missed assignments.  Expect to spend approximately three hours working on homework outside of class for every hour spent in class.  Homework submitted on more than one sheet of paper should be stapled, not attached with a paperclip.  <b>MESSY OR UNSTAPLED HOMEWORK WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</b>


<p>

<b> Exams:</b>

<br>

<br>

There will be two exams during the quarter in addition to one final
exam.  The first two exams will be held on Monday, January 28th and
Monday, February 18th. The final exam will be held on Monday, March 11.
<b>IT IS DARTMOUTH POLICY THAT FINAL EXAMS ARE NOT SUBJECT
TO RESCHEDULING SO PLEASE DO NOT MAKE YOUR PLANS TO LEAVE CAMPUS UNTIL
THE REGISTRAR HAS ANNOUNCED THE SCHEDULE FOR FINALS.</b>

<b> Weekly Quizzes:</b><br><br>

There will be a short quiz at the end of the last class of the week (usually Friday.)  The quiz will cover the material from that week and will contain problems similar to those on the homework. <b> MISSING CLASS ON THE DAY OF A QUIZ WILL RESULT IN A SCORE OF ZERO ON THAT QUIZ.</b>

<p>

Quizzes will be given on Friday of each week, except for the week of Winter Carnival.  That week the quiz will be given on Thursday, February 7th due to Winter Carnival.

<p>

<b> Office Hours:</b>

<br>

<br>

We encourage you to visit during office hours if you have any questions,
need help with homework problems, or would just like to talk about the
material.  See above for times.

<p>


<b> Grading: </b> 

<br>

<br>

Your final letter grade for Math 2 will be determined by the fraction of 480 possible points you earn.  The components of the total score are: 

<br>

<br> Hour Exam 1:  100

<br> Hour Exam 2:  100

<br> Final Exam:  150 

<br> 8 Quizzes: 80  (10 points each)

<br> Homework:  50 (2 points each)

<br>

<br> Total:  480

<p>

The 25 homework assignments will be graded given 0, 1, or 2 points as follows:

<br>

<ul>

<li>0 means major errors and/or little to show,

<li>1 means significant errors and/or partially complete,

<li>2 means substantially complete and correct.

</ul>

<p>

<b> Tutorials: </b> <br><br>
Tutorials are scheduled Monday through Thursday nights in room 201F of
Carpenter Hall at the following times:<br>
<ul>
<li>Mondays: 8:00-10:00 p.m.
<li>Tuesdays: 7:00-9:00 p.m.
<li>Wednesdays: 8:00-10:00 p.m.
<li>Thursdays: 6:30-8:30 p.m.
</ul><br>
  Tutorials are optional, but you are encouraged to use them to work on the homework or for help with the course material.  Additionally, the tutors are available on a limited basis to provide individual help to students who feel they need it.  Arrangements for individual tutoring should be made with the tutor. 

<p>
<b> Honor Principle: </b>
Dartmouth students are expected to adhere to the honor principle.  In this course, that means that while homework can and should be worked on and discussed with others, the work you hand in must be your own.  No copying!  All exams will be closed book and closed notes, and obviously no collaboration is allowed on exams.  Calculators are <b> NOT </b> permitted on exams.  

<p> <b> Special Needs: </b>
Any student with a disability for whom special accommodations would be helpful is encouraged to discuss this with the instructor as soon as possible.
