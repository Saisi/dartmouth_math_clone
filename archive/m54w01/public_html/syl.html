<H1>Basic Topology (<a
href="index.html"> Math 54 </a>) Syllabus</H1>
</CENTER>
<p>
Math 54  will be an introductory course in
topology with an emphasis on developing geometric insight and in obtaining
an overview of the various techniques used in topology (these
include ideas from geometry, algebra and analysis).
The topics covered in this course (and its sequel math 74) will
include the  fundamental concepts (continuity, compactness, connectedness,  
and  product spaces), identification spaces, the fundamental group,
topological groups, covering space theory, and
the geometry and topology of compact surfaces.  
<p>


<p>
More explicitly, in math 54 we will cover chapters 1
through 5 and 10.4 of Armstrong's <I> Basic Topology  </I>  
as well as a proof of the classification of compact surfaces and some
additional applications of the fundamental group.  We will follow the
following steps.

<p>
Step 1: Intuitive topology.  We will learn to deal with "topological
objects" by assuming their "obvious" properties as axioms.  In the process
we shall develop an understanding of the Euler Characteristic and
classify compact connected  surfaces (via Conway's ZIP proof). 


<p>
Step2:
Next we will formalize of intuitive topology via the language of set
theory and  explore the fundamental concepts (chapters 1 - 3) in terms of
this language.  This will include understanding carefully the concepts of 
continuity, basis, compactness, connectedness, and  product spaces.


<p>
Step 3: Constructions.  Now we will learn how to construct interesting
topological spaces (in particular our initial surfaces). This will include  
identification spaces and a brief look into topological groups (chapter
4) and  <a href="axiom/need.pdf"> deck-like </a> group actions.  

<p>

At this point we will have our first <a href="exam/M54x.pdf"> exam
</a>. 


<p>
Step 4:
The fundamental group (chapter 5).  We explore the fundamental group and
learn to compute it via the  <a href="axiom/need.pdf"> deck theorem</a>
(using the language of covering space theory (10.4)). 
 

<p>
 Step 5: Applications.  We will apply the fundamental group to understand
a variety of basic topological questions.  In particular we will prove the 
"meteorological" theorem, the "there's your scalp!" theorem, the Brower
fixed point theorem, and several <a href="axiom/need.pdf"> other </a>
results.  

<p> We will finish with our final <a href="exam/f.pdf">
exam </a>.

<p>

In math 74 we will follow <a
