<B>Grade cutoffs for both exams combined:</B> Add your two exam scores together and compare to the table below.  
That would be your grade if I had to assign grades today based only on your exam scores (so homework and the final
can still change this siginificantly).

A- 170 - 182
B+ 161 - 169
B  148 - 160

<b>Exams</b>:  Both midterms and the final will be in-class, closed-book, and closed-notes, and calculators will
not be allowed.  The date and time has not yet been set for any of the exams, but note that the final exam period
lasts until Wednesday, March 14, so make your travel plans accordingly (plane reservations are <i>not</i>
a sufficient reason to reschedule your final exam).

<P>

<B>FINAL EXAM UPDATE:</B>  The final exam is now officially set for Tuesday, March 13, from 9:00 -- 11:00
a.m. in Spaulding Auditorium (quadrant E7 of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~deancoll/map/800x600/ae-58.html">this
campus map</a>).  Recall that plane reservations are not a sufficient reason to re-schedule the final.


<p>

<b>Makeup policy</b>: Homework will be assigned (almost) every class
period, and will be due at the next class meeting.  <i>No late
homework will be accepted for any reason</i>, but your three lowest
homework scores will be dropped before computing your grade.  Thus you
may miss up to three homework assignments without penalty.  

<p>

Makeup tests will only be given in case of legitimate emergencies.  

<p>

<b>Tutorial:</b> The tutors for this term are <a href="mailto:kevin.missett@dartmouth.edu">Kevin Missett</a> and <a
href="mailto:rudel@dartmouth.edu">David Rudel</a>.  There will be a tutorial every Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday
night from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m. in Bradley
101 (the usual classroom).

<p>

<b>Honor policy</b>:
<ul>
<li>Collaboration is encouraged during the process of
thinking about homework problems, but is not acceptable while writing
up your final solutions.  That is, working together on homework is
fine, but copying is not.  
<li>No collaboration of any form is acceptable during exams.
</ul>

<p>

<b>Students with disabilities</b>:  Any student with a documented disability needing academic adjustments or
accommodations is requested to speak with the professor by the end of the second week of the term.  All discussions
will remain confidential, although the Academic Skills Center may be consulted to verify the documentation of the
disability.
