<P>
<B>Information for the the second midterm (this is no longer subject to change)</B>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The midterm will be Thursday, February 22 from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. at Murdough Cook Auditorium (the same
place as last time).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>No books or notes of any kind will be allowed.  No calculators will be
allowed.  Also, of course, no communication with your fellow students (or
anyone else) is allowed during the exam.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Officially, the midterm covers everything covered in class from Wednesday, January 31 through Monday,
February 19 (inclusive).  
Because we have deviated quite a bit from the book in the last few weeks, it's easier to list the topics covered,
rather than the sections.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>extreme value problems (section 4.5)
</LI>
<LI>mean value theorem (section 2.6 - we didn't do much with it, but you should know the statement of the mean
value theorem, and the picture that goes with it.)
</LI>
<LI>implicit differentiation (section 2.9)
</LI>
<LI>anti-derivatives (section 2.10)
</LI>
<LI>position, velocity, and acceleration, and how they relate to differentiation (section 2.11)
</LI>
<LI>exponential and logarithmic functions and their derivatives (this is in section 3.2/3.3 of your book, but we 
did things in a different order and in a different way).
</LI>
<LI>inverse trigonometric functions and their derivatives (section 3.5)
</LI>
<LI>indeterminate forms and l'Hopital's rule (section 4.9)
</LI>
<LI>sigma notation for sums (section 5.1)
</LI>
<LI>Riemann sums for estimating the area under a curve
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
This exam is not cumulative, but you are, of course, responsible for retaining the main ideas of calculus that you
learned in the first weeks of the course (like, for example, the chain rule, and how to sketch detailed graphs of
functions, etc.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The format of the exam will be as follows (same as the first exam):

<UL>
<LI>12 multiple choice questions (five points each).  No partial credit will be awarded on the multiple choice
section.
</LI>
<LI>Three longer questions which will be graded carefully, and on which
partial credit can be obtained (13 points each).
</LI>
<LI>One point for legibly printing your name.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Very roughly speaking, about 50-70 percent of the exam will consist of questions similar to questions you've
seen (and done) on homeworks and in class.  The remainder will be extensions of the ideas we've talked about in
class - ranging from very slight extensions to harder problems that require a very solid understanding of the
concepts we've learned.  If necessary, the scores will be curved - I expect the median grade to be a B.

<P>
