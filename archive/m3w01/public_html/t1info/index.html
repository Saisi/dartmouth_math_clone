<P>
<B>Information for the the first midterm</B>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The midterm will be Thursday, February 1 from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.
in Murdough Cook Auditorium.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>No books or notes of any kind will be allowed.  No calculators will be
allowed.  Also, of course, no communication with your fellow students (or
anyone else) is allowed during the exam.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The exam will cover the following sections:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>1.2 - 1.4
</LI>
<LI>2.1 - 2.5, 2.8
</LI>
<LI>4.2 - 4.4
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Note that, while you are responsible for all the material covered in Chapter
P, you will not be <I>directly</I> tested on it.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The format of the exam will be as follows:

<UL>
<LI>12 multiple choice questions (five points each).  No partial credit will be awarded on the multiple choice
section.
</LI>
<LI>Three longer questions which will be graded carefully, and on which
partial credit can be obtained (13 points each).
</LI>
<LI>One point for legibly printing your name.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Very roughly speaking, about 50-70 percent of the exam will consist of questions similar to questions you've
seen (and done) on homeworks and in class.  The remainder will be extensions of the ideas we've talked about in
class - ranging from very slight extensions to harder problems that require a very solid understanding of the
concepts we've learned.  If necessary, the scores will be curved - I expect the median grade to be a B.

<P>
