We will study formal deductions in a formallanguage, which are proofs formulated in a precise framework, so precise that they can be studiedmathematically:  We can prove things about them.  Our results about formal deductions can illuminate theproofs found in mathematicians' research papers and in mathematics students' homework papers.<p>We will begin the course with the study of the language of sentential logic, a formal language that is notpowerful enough to model the language used by working mathematicians.  Building on this, we will study themore powerful language of first order logic, and the notion of formal deduction in first order logic.  Wewill prove Godel's Completeness Theorem, a major result, which states that this notion of formal deductioncompletely captures the power of mathematical proof in the following sense:  Given any axiom system (forexample, the axioms for a real vector space) and any statement in our language, either that statement can beproved from the axioms by means of a formal deduction, or else we cannot hope to prove the statement becausethere is a context (in our example, a real vector space) in which the axioms are true but the statement isfalse.<p>We will see how the Completeness Theorem can be applied to develop a logically valid way of doing calculuswith infinitesimals, or infinitely small numbers.  (So you really can compute a derivative by dividing aninfinitely small dy by an infinitely small dx.)  We will also briefly discuss Godel's Incopleteness Theorem,which tells us that it is impossible (<i>mathematically</i> impossible) to write down a complete system ofaxioms for the natural numbers:  Any valid system of axioms we come up with is necessarily incomplete in thatthere are facts about the natural numbers that are true but cannot be proved from those axioms.<p>An important philosophical consideration through our study will be the notion of "effective" or"algorithmic" process.  For example, Godel's Incompleteness Theorem will tell us that there is no algorithm tolist all the true statements about the natural numbers.  In other words, it is impossible to program a computerto answer all possible questions (even in our restricted formal language) about the natural numbers.<p><br><!-- Textbook separator --><table bgcolor=#7397b0 border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left><a name="textbk"></a>Textbook</th></table><p><!-- Textbook information --><i>A Mathematical Introduction to Logic</i> by Herbert B.

Are you prepared? When the class divides into small groups, do you fully particpate in your group's work?  Do you contributeto class discussions, or present homework solutions to the class, when you are asked to?  Classparticpation grades are not based on whether you talk a lot or say brilliant things.<p>Written homework will be graded both on content and on clarity of writing.  Writing clear andunderstandable proofs is critical in all areas of mathematics, but particularly called for in the study ofmathematical logic.<p>In-class exams will not require lengthy proofs and will be graded on content.<p>The final exam will have a take-home portion, which, like written homework, will be graded both on contentand on clarity of writing.<p><br><!-- Honor Principle separator --><table bgcolor=#7397b0 border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left><a name="honor"></a>The Honor Principle</th></table><p><!-- Honor Principle details -->Academic integrity and intellectual honesty are an integral part of academic practice.  This does not meanthat you can't work on homework together or get ideas and help from other people.  It does mean that youcan't present somebody else's work or ideas without giving them due credit.<p>Feel free to discuss homework problems withother people and to work together to answer them.  You must write up the answersyourself without copying from anybody.  (This means you cannot copy down a joint solution arrived at by agroup working together, even if you were part of the group.  You must write up the solution in your ownwords.)  You must also acknowledge any sources your consulted or people you worked with; working withother people or consulting other sources will not lower your grade.<p>Of course, no help may be given or received on exams.  For the take-home portion of the final exam, theonly sources you may consult are your textbook, your class notes and the instructor.<p><br><!-- Disabilities separator --><table bgcolor=#7397b0 border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left><A NAME="disabilities"></a>Disabilities</th></table><p><!-- Disabilities statement -->Students with disabilities who will be taking this course and may needdisability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make anappointment to see the instructor as soon as possible.
