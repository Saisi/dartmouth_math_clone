<P>We encourage you to contact us by e-mail for purposes of asking
questions, making comments, or setting up meetings.</P> 
<B><U><P>Teaching
Assistants</U>:</B> Kelly Fender, Tracy Van Dorpe, Dongmei Xu </P>
<B><U><P>Math Tutors</U>:</B> Steven Gay will be in 13 Bradley (in the basement) Tuesdays 6:30 pm to 7:30 pm and Thursdays 8:00 pm to 9:00 pm. Zeynep Oz will be there Tuesdays from 7:00 to 9:00.</P>
<B><U><P>General organization</U>:</B> </P> <P>The class will meet three days a week. Two of these meetings will follow a lecture format, for the most part alternating between humanities and mathematics. The Friday session will usually combine joint presentations by the instructors to bridge gaps across disciplines and to open student discussion. If you would like to suggest a question or topic for the Friday Discussion, you should post it on the course website (see address below) by early Thursday morning. The topics to be addressed during the Friday Discussion will be posted on the website by Thursday afternoon. All students should review the topics for the Friday Discussion before coming to class.</P> 

<B><U><P>Course Website</U>:</B> </P> <P>The address of the <I>CL 65/Math 5,
Winter 2003 - A Matter of Time</I> website is <A
HREF="index.html">http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m5w03/</A>.
We will use it as an integral part of the course, so you definitely should check
it out right away and add it to your bookmarks.</P> 

<B><U><P>Assignments and
grades</U>:</P> </B><P>In addition to completing all reading assignments and math assignments by the due-date, students will be expected to participate actively in class discussions, especially the Friday Discussions. There also will be two multiple-choice exams (one each in weeks four and seven), and a final paper. The multiple choice exams will be 50 questions each, with roughly 10 of those being math problems. The questions will draw on material from the textbook and the reader, as presented in class. The final will be a five-page double-spaced paper on a choice of assigned topics, due on the first day of final examinations. The two exams and the paper will each be worth 100 points for an overall total of 300 points.</P> 

<B><U><P>Discussion Sessions with the TAs</U>: </P> </B><P>The TAs will be organizing a number of discussion sessions on Thursdays during the x-hour (except for the first, which will meet at 7:00 p.m. because the class will be meeting that week in the x-hour due to MLK Day). The purpose of these sessions is to discuss course material and to provide a forum in which students can talk in smaller groups. The sessions will occur in weeks 3, 5, 6, and 8. Note that this schedule will give ample opportunity to brainstorm about the exams and the final.

<B><U><P>Meetings with your instructors</U>:</P> </B><P>You should not hesitate to contact any one of your instructors about issues related to the course. You can send e-mail messages to us, make appointments, or drop into our scheduled office hours.</P> 

<B><U><P>Academic Honor Principle</U>:</P></B> 
<P><B>On in-class exams:</B> Feel free to brainstorm with fellow students, the TAs and tutors, or your instructors as you prepare for the exam. During the taking of the exam itself, no help is to be given or received.</P>
<P><B>On homework or the final paper:</B> Feel free to brainstorm with fellow students, the TAs and tutors, or your instructors. However, when it comes to writing your paper (or any other materials for submission), you must do so by yourself without outside assistance and in your own words. In this regard, it is a violation of the Honor Principle to share electronic files or notes, or to participate in editing a joint document. You must produce by yourself the paper written for submission, and there should be no doubt that this is what we expect.</P><DIR>

<B><P>&#9;</P></DIR>

<U><P>Students with Disabilities</U>:</P> </B><P>Any student with a documented disability needing academic adjustments or accommodations is requested to speak to one of your instructors by the end of the second week of the term. All discussions will remain confidential, although the Student Disabilities Coordinator may be consulted to verify the documentation of the disability. The Student Disabilities Coordinator is Nancy Pompian, at extension 6-2014, in the Academic Skills Center. In addition to providing information and services, the Center is in charge of registering disabilities and approving accommodations.</P> <P>
