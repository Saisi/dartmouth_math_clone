As our understanding of the physical world         has become more sophisticated, it has become evident that symmetry plays         a more profound role than is apparent at first glance. This deep connection         turns out to hinge on our ability to formulate principles governing physical         processes as principles of ``least action'', as was explained by Emmy         Noether less than 100 years ago. In this talk, I will describe some of         the ideas and the history of the development of this mathematical understanding         of the relationship<br>        between symmetry (for example, the principle of invariance) and conserved         quantities (such as energy and momentum) and how it still shapes our attempts         to develop a ``theory of everything''. I will attempt to explain why string         theory seems to require our universe to be a space of much higher dimension         than is apparent to our senses. No mathematics beyond vector calculus         will be assumed. </p>    </blockquote>  </blockquote></blockquote><p align="left">&nbsp;</p></body></html>
