<br>

<br>The textbook for this course is a course reader available at Wheelock Books.<br>

<br>Homework and reading will be assigned each class period and will be due before the next class.
  You should submit homework to the homework boxes on the first floor of Bradley Hall.  (The Math 15 
  boxes are more or less opposite the door to 103 Bradley.)  Late homework will be accepted for partial 
  credit but may not be graded.  If you have a valid reason for turning in homework late (such as an 
  illness or a family emergency) please talk to Professor Groszek.<br>
  
<br>There may be occasional in-class quizzes.  There will be in-class exercises on which you will be graded credit/
nocredit based on your participation (<i>not</i> on the correctness of your work.) If you are not present for a quiz
or a graded exercise you will receive a grade of zero.<br>

<br>Grades in Math 15.1 will be based on homework, exams, and in-class quizzes
and exercises.  Your lowest two homework grades, your lowest quiz grade, and your lowest
class exercise grade will be dropped before computing your end-of-term average.  Homework will be graded on a scale of 1-10; 
5 points will be automatic if you make an attempt at every problem.  Late homework will receive 5 points and will 
not be graded.  In-class exercises will be graded credit/no-credit.<br>

<br>Your final grade will be computed in two ways, and you will receive the higher of the two grades:<br>
1.  Homework, quizzes, and classroom work 20%, each midterm 20%, final 40%.<br>
2.  Homework, quizzes, and classroom work 25%, each midterm 25%, final 25%.<br>

<br>Grades in Math 15.1 are not curved; other students' good performance will not hurt your grade.  (So
 please work together and help each other out.)  The grade scale is: 93% A, 90% A-, 85% B+, 
 75% B, 70% B-, 67% C+, 63% C, 60% C-, 55% D+, 50% D.<br>

<br>Every student who matriculates at Dartmouth agrees to abide by the
academic honor principle.  You have an obligation to act with integrity in your own academic
work, and to take action if you observe honor code violations by others.  Academic integrity
is essential to the scientific enterprise and I take it seriously.<br>

<br>
In Math 15.1 you are encouraged to work together on homework problems, and to use professors,
tutors, other students, other textbooks, and generally any resource you can find that will
help you understand and work the problems.  You must write up the homework solutions by
yourself in your own words.<br>

<br>You must do all work on exams independently, without giving or receiving assistance of any
kind.<br>

<br>If you have a disability of any sort that may affect your participation in the course or require
accommodations, please speak to the professor at the beginning of the term.  These conversations will be completely
confidential, with the single exception that the professor may contact the Student Disabilities Coordinator at
the Academic Skills Center to discuss appropriate accommodations.  Students with disabilities that may need
classroom accommodations should also talk to the Student Disabilities Coordinator directly.<br>

<br>Please talk to Professor Groszek as soon as possible, or whenever
something comes up, about any special concerns you have about the class.  If you
have athletic or other extracurricular commitments and hope to accomodate them (for example,
by taking midterms at alternative times), talk to the professor.  If you are in any way
concerned about the course or your performance in it, talk to the professor.<br>

<br>If you can't do the homework, talk to the professor.  Also talk to the tutor about any of
your concerns.  Make an appointment if you can't make our regular hours.  We are here and we
want to see you.<br>

<h2>Exam Information</h2>

There will be two midterm exams, given on MOnday Oct. 21 and Nov. 18, 4-6 PM, 111 Wilder Hall, and on final, given

Groszek <b>as soon as possible</b> about scheduling an alternate time.  With less than a week's notice, scheduling 
an alternate time may not be possible.  Final exmas are given only during the scheduled time.<br>
<br>The first midterm covers the course material in the first four weeks of the course, the second covers the material 
in the second four weeks, and the final is cumulative.  Remember that problems on exams will require you to know and use 
physics as well as math concepts.<br>
