<H2> Final Exam: Friday, May 30, 8-11 am in 008 Kemeny</H2>

The exam will be comprehensive, but will be weighted towards material 
covered since the second exam.  The following topics are contained 
in sections we covered, but WILL NOT be on the exam:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Taylor's Inequality (12.10)</li>
<li> Proving that a function is equal to its Taylor series (12.10)</li>
<li> Direction angles and direction cosines (13.3)</li>
<li> Curvature, normal and binormal vectors (14.3)</li>
<li> Tangential and normal components of accelartion; Kepler's laws 
(14.4)</li>
</ul>
<p>

Here are some suggested problems from the review sections in chapters 14 
and 15.  Unless otherwise noted, they are identical in the 5th and 6th 
editions.  Unfortunately, solutions for the Chapter 15 problems are not 
in hotmath.  Remember that the homework page also has practice 
problems for each section we've covered.
<p>
Chapter 14 Review (pp. 886--887, or 918--919 in 5th ed.): 3, 9, 17, 19
<p>
Chapter 15 Review (pp. 981--983, or 1011--1013 in 5th ed.): 9, 17, 27, 
31 (similar problems in each ed.), 33, 45, 47, 53, 55
<p>
Other sources of practice problems from previous sections of Math 8:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <A 
HREF="../../m8w04/public_html/exams.html">
Practice problems and solutions</A> 
for material from the last third of 
the course</li>
<li> <A

Final with solutions</A></li>
</ul>



<p>
<H2>Exam 2: Thursday, May 8, 4-6 pm in Carson L02</H2>

<A HREF="exam2_solutions.pdf">SOLUTIONS</A> to the second exam<p>
<A HREF="histogram.pdf">Histogram</A> of the course grades as of 
5/9/08<p>

Your grade to date includes the first two exams 
plus your webwork total scaled to 35 points, giving a total of 235 
possible points.  I then scaled these totals to a grade percentage out 
of 100.  The histogram above gives the distribution of these grade 
percentages.<p>

*****************************************
<br>
The exam will cover sections 12.6, 12.8--12.10, and 13.1--13.5, <I>EXCEPT</I> for the following topics:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Taylor's Inequality (12.10)</li>
<li> Proving that a function is equal to its Taylor series (12.10)</li>
<li> Direction angles and direction cosines (13.3)</li>
</ul> 
<p>

Here are some suggested practice problems from the review sections in chapters 12 and 13.  They are numbered identically in the 5th edition.  
Remember that full solutions are available on hotmath.  I recommend that you practice with as many problems as you can.  Remember that the homework 
page also lists practice problems for each section.
<p>
Chapter 12 Review (pp. 796--796, or 823--824 in 5th ed): 23, 25, 31, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 55, 57(a)
<p>
Chapter 13 Review (pp. 849--850, or 881--882 in 5th ed): 1, 3, 5, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23
<p>


Additionally, you can find copies of old exams on the webpages for previous sections of Math 8, which are all linked from the math department
homepage.
Keep in
mind that different instructors emphasize different material, and exams offered later in the term will cover material we haven't gotten to yet.
<p>



<p>
<H2>Exam 1: Thursday, April 17, 4-6 pm in Carson L02</H2>

<A HREF="exam1_solutions.pdf">SOLUTIONS</A> to the first exam
<p>

** Alternate time for students with class or sports conflicts:  6:30--8:30 pm.  If you need to take the later exam, please email me with your reason 
no later than Monday, April 14. **
<p>

The exam will cover sections 8.1--8.3, 8.8, and 12.1--12.5.  I would suggest reading through sections 8.5 and 12.7, as these give strategies for 
solving integrals and testing series for convergence when you are not told at the outset which method to use.  Keep in mind that we did not cover 
section 8.4, so you will not need to know how to integrate rational functions.  
<p>

Here are some suggested practice problems from the textbook.  The corresponding probelms from the 5th edition are given in parentheses.  Remember 
that full solutions are available on hotmath if you look them up using the 5th edition numbers. 
<p>

Section 8.5 # 9, 13, 15, 17, 19, 33, 37 (5th ed: pp. 546--547, # 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 33, 37)
<p>
Section 8.8 # 9, 11, 21, 31 (5th ed: p. 574, same numbers)
<p>
Section 12.7 # 1, 3, 7, 11, 19, 31 (5th ed: p. 784, # 7, 11, 19 and 31 are the same; no analog for 1 or 3)
<p>

Additionally, you can find copies of old exams on the webpages for previous sections of Math 8, which are all linked from the math department 
homepage.  
Keep in 
mind that different instructors emphasize different material, and exams offered later in the term will cover material we haven't gotten to yet.
