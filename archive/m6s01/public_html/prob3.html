<p><font size=+1>1. How many edges does a complete graph with 11 vertices
have?</font>
<p><font size=+1>2. Draw a tournament with five vertices which has five
cyclic triples.&nbsp; What is the score sequence of this tournament?</font>
<p><font size=+1>Think about, but don't hand in:&nbsp; Can the directions
of some of the edges of the tournament in the previous problem be changed
so as to give a tournament with more than five cyclic triples?&nbsp; Can
the directions be changed to produce a tournament with exactly four cyclic
triples?</font>
