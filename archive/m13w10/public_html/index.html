<center><h2>Announcements</h2></center>

<p> March 17, 2010: All old homework assignments will be available for pickup in the homework boxes outside Kemeny 008 later this afternoon.  Final exams and final letter grades for the class have also been determined, so if you would like to see your final exam and find out your letter grade before the registrar releases them on Monday, please drop by my office.  I'll probably be in during the times we used to have office hours and classes.  However, I will not respond to emails asking for grades.  <p>

<p> March 9, 2010:  Homeworks #1 - #7 are available for pickup in the homework boxes outside the classroom, and Homework #8 should be available by Thursday.  A <A HREF = "Math%2013%20Final%20Guide.pdf">Final Study Guide</A> is also now available on this website, although I cannot guarantee that the contents are comprehensive or typo free.  
<p>

<p> March 1, 2010:  The location of the final exam will be in 028 Silsby Hall, not 13 Carpenter. 

We will have normal classes on March 1 and 3rd.  On March 5 we will have an optional class whose content will be an overview of extensions of the material we learned in this class.  

We will have a review session on March 8, and if the classroom is available, on March 10 and 11 as well.  <p

<p> February 17, 2010: Remember that the second midterm will be held in Carpenter 13 from 5:00pm - 7:00pm on Thursday, February 18.  The material on the exam is everything from Chapter 16.6 to Chapter 17.4 (Green's Theorem).  In addition, it will probably help to remember the material from the first third of the class.  There will also be a question and answer session at 008 Kemeny during the usual X-hour time, from 1:00 - 2:00pm, on Thursday, to help review for the midterm. <p>

<p> February 8, 2010: The second midterm will be held in Carpenter 13 from 5:00pm - 7:00pm on Thursday, February 18.  If you have a conflict please email me as soon as possible.  The topics which will be covered are everything from Chapter 16.6 (triple integration) to the material this Friday. 

<p> January 23, 2010: The first midterm will be held in Carpenter 13 from 5:00pm - 7:00pm on Thursday.  If you have a conflict please email me as soon as possible.  The topics which will be covered are Chapter 15 and Chapters 16.1 - 16.5.    
<p> 
January 15, 2010: Location and times for the midterm exams have been posted.  They are listed below, and will take place on Jan 28 and Feb 18, from 5pm - 7pm, in Carpenter 13.  
<p>
January 6, 2010: Office hours have been moved back 30 minutes from the times announced in the first class, to 12:30pm - 2:00pm.  Also, tutorials will take place in Kemeny 108 from 7:00pm - 9:00pm on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, with the first tutorial session starting on January 10.  Exam times will be posted shortly.
<p>
January 4, 2010: The syllabus for this class has been posted, along with information about office hours and the location of the class.  Webwork, tutorial, and exam information is not available yet, but will be posted within two days. <p>

December 9, 2009: A preliminary version of this website is being posted.  The textbook information is accurate, but everything else is either wrong or subject to change.  Prospective students might be interested in consulting a list of <a href = "http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m13w10/m13background">things to know</a> (not working yet), which contains a list of topics from Math 8 that we will assume you know well when we start Math 13.

</p>

<p> Required: <i>Calculus</i>, 6th edition, by James Stewart, ISBN 978-0495011606.<br>

This is the same book that was used for Math 8 in the fall semester.  If you do not have this book, you might want to try finding former Math 8 students who no longer need this book and are willing to sell it used.
</p>



<p> Optional: <i>Div, grad, curl, and all that</i>, 4th Edition, by H.M. Schey, ISBN 978-0393925166.

This book takes a more informal and physics-inspired approach to the material in the second half of the class.  It is well-written, contains many exercises, and is not particularly long, so this book might be a useful supplement to the main text.
</p>

<p> <i>Calculus, Volume II</i>, 2nd edition, by Tom Apostol, ISBN 978-0471000075.

This book contains a lot of the material we will be covering in this class, in a slightly more abstract way.  This book also contains linear algebra, and so is able to present multivariable calculus in a more generalized and uniform setting.  
</p>

<p> <i>Calculus on Manifolds</i>, by Michael Spivak, ISBN 978-0805390216. 

This book is for more ambitious students, who are interested in understanding the material in the second half of the class in a more general context.  Students who intend to major in mathematics or theoretical physics will be the ones who find this book relevant.  If you choose to read this book you will probably need outside assistance to do so.
</p>

<p>It is each student's responsibility to be aware of <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/calendars/term/2009-09.html">academic deadlines</a> as enforced by the Registrar.<br><br></p>

<ul>   <li>There will be two separate parts to your homework assignments. The first, called <a href="../../m8s09/public_html/webwork_info.html">WeBWork,</a>
is to be done on a computer and submitted via the web.  
Webwork assignments will be made each class day, as indicated on <a href="m13w10syllabus.html">Syllabus and Homework Assignments</a>.  The
assignment will be due at 7:00 am four or five days later.  You will
only be able to submit the assignment during the time that it is open; at 7 am on the due date, the assignment will close and the correct answers will be
available to view. 


</li> 
<br> 

 <li>The second part of the homework consists of several problems which will be assigned weekly.  These problems are to be written up and handed in.  You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates on your homework assignments, but you should understand all the work you write down and write your solutions separately from others.  The written homework will be due on Wednesday, in class, or outside in the homework boxes (one will be marked for Math 13), at 2:00pm.  Late homeworks can be turned in, but you will receive no points and will only get comments back.  If you are ill, have a family emergency, or have some other reason for turning in an assignment late, please talk or email me several days in advance to arrange an extension.  Homework assignments will be returned in class, usually on the Monday after they have been handed in.</li>   
<br>


<li>There will be appropriate adjustments to the homework schedule for holidays.  More details about homework are posted on the course assignment webpage (<a href="m13w10syllabus.html">Syllabus and Homework Assignments</a>).</li><br>
