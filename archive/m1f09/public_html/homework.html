Every week, there will be 3
WebWork assignments and one written
assignment.&nbsp;The WebWork assignments will be due Monday, Wednesday
and Friday at the beginning of each class. The written assignments will
be collected on Fridays at the beginning of class. &nbsp;<br>


<br>


Each written assignment is worth 15 points, while each WebWork
assignment is worth 5 points. Please keep this in mind when working on
the homework. It's not worth "blowing off" your written assignment to
complete one extra problem on WebWork.<br>


<br>


The written assignments can be typed or handwritten, in pencil or pen,
on any type of paper that you prefer as long as we are able to read it.
We reserve the right to give no credit for papers that we deem
illegible.<br>

We created our class blog because we want to encourage you to have your own
discussions about the course. Please feel free to use this blog in any
way that you may find helpful. For example, you can post an invitation
to others to form a study group. You can post any questions that you
may have, either about the homework or about the course in general. We
will make our best effort to respond to your questions in a timely
manner. That said, we are not available every minute of the day, so we
strongly encourage you to answer your classmates' questions if you see
one that has not been answered yet. By explaining course material to
another student, you will learn it better yourself!<br>
