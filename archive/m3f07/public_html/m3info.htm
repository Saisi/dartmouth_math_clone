<P>
<A name=topic1><B>The three sections of the course behave as one:</B></A> That is, all of the required work is the same, as is the material that is covered. The grades are assigned as if all students were attending the same class. So, you should feel free to talk to any of us, even though you probably should seek out your own instructor first, primarily because we want to get to know as many of you as possible.</P>

<P>
<A name=topic2><B>Textbook:</B></A> The manuscript <I>Principles of Calculus Modeling: An Interactive Approach</I>, by Donald Kreider, Dwight Lahr, and Susan Diesel, is available at the College Copy Center in Thayer. Each section of the book has a companion page on the Web which can be accessed at the KLDbook site (see left sidebar).

<P>
<A name=topic5><B>Class Meetings:</B></A> Class meetings consist of three 65-minute lectures. Normally, we will not meet in the x-hours; however, you must keep the time slots open because they may occasionally be used. The lectures introduce new material and provide the course structure.

<P>
<A name=topic6><B>Examinations:</B></A> There will be two hour-exams and a (three-hour) final examination. The final exam has been scheduled by the Registrar's office for Friday, December 7 at 11:30 a.m. Don't make any travel plans that might conflict with this time because all Math 3 students must be there. Here is the schedule of the two hour-exams and final:
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<ul>
<li>Hour-Exam 1: Wednesday, Oct. 24, 3:30–4:45 p.m. [Alternate time for students with labs or team practice-- 6:30-7:45 p.m. Notify your instructor.]</li>
<li>Hour-Exam 2: Monday, Nov. 12, 3:30–4:45 p.m. [Alternate time for students with labs or team practice-- 6:30-7:45 p.m. Notify your instructor.]</li>
<li>Final Exam: Friday, Dec. 7, 11:30 a.m.-2:30 p.m., Hopkins Spaulding</li>
</ul>

Each of the two hour-exams will consist of two parts—-a multiple-choice part and a non multiple-choice part where partial credit can be earned. The final exam will be multiple-
choice. No calculators or computers will be needed or allowed in the sit-down exams.

<P>
<A name=topic7><B>Daily Homework Problem Sets:</B></A> You will get and turn in <u>all</u> Math 3 homework over the World Wide Web using WeBWorK (see left sidebar for login). Homework due-dates will be shown on the WeBWorK assignments, which will generally be due at 8:00 a.m. on the second class day after the class in which the material is covered. Answers will be available at 1:00 p.m. on the same day. Late homework will not be accepted without advance permission from your
instructor, obtained well before the assignment is due. There will normally be at least one class-day between the day homework is assigned and the day it is due, thereby providing plenty of opportunity for you to get your questions answered. 

<P>
<A name=topic8><B>Case Study in Calculus Assignments:</B></A> This term we are going to develop four extended applications of calculus. They will be done in the form of what we will call a <I>Case Study in Calculus</I> (CSC). The CSC will be an example of using calculus to model real-world problems involving real data. They are nothing more than extended homework problems in WeBWorK. [They will not involve written reports. Note that this is a departure from what the textbook states.]
<P>
<A name=topic9><B>Academic Honor Principle:</B></A> On the two hour-exams and the final examination you will work individually, guided by the Dartmouth Academic Honor Principle. On the daily homework exercises and on the CSC homework, you will each have different numbers and you will turn in assignments individually, although you are encouraged to work collaboratively. The CSCs in particular are more fun when conceptualized in a group. However, collaboration does not include copying someone else's work——a clear violation of the Honor Principle. Feel free to talk with other students about the material. You may even decide to form a study group for that purpose. You also may seek assistance from a tutor or your instructor(s). When it comes to writing up the homework, however, you should do this by yourself without outside assistance. In this regard, it is a violation of the Honor Principle to share electronic files, or to type answers into someone else's WeBWorK account.

<P>
<A name=topic10><B>Grades:</B></A> The course grade will be based upon the scores of the two hour-exams, the final examination, and the homework, as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hour-Exams: 200 points (100 points each)<BR>
Final Exam: 150 points (multiple-choice)<BR>
Homework: 50 points (20 for the CSCs, and 30 for the rest)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The total of 400 points will be the basis for final grades in the course.

<P>
<A name=topic11><B>Tutorials:</B></A> Assistance on the daily homework can be obtained in tutorials staffed by graduate Course Assistants and undergraduate student tutors. All tutorials are scheduled from 7:00 to 9:00 pm on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings and are held in Carson L02. They begin Thursday September 27.

<P>
<A name=topic14><B>Students' Religious Observances:</B></A> Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term.  If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with your instructor before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.

<P>
<A name=topic12><B>Disabilities:</B></A> We encourage students with documented disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities such as chronic diseases, learning disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities, to discuss possible accommodations with one of your instructors. Students might want to consult as well Student Accessibility Services, 301 Collis Center, ext. 6-2014. In addition to providing information and services, the office can assist with determining appropriate accomodations and registering them.
<P>
<A name=topic13><B>Math 3 Website:</B></A> We have set up a website to organize the materials of the course. The address is <A HREF="index.html">http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m3f07/</A>.

<P>
Have a good term. We look forward to working with you.</P>
