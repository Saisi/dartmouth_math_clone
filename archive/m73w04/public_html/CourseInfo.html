<B> Text-book: </B> 
James R. Munkres, <i>Analysis on manifolds</I>, 
publisher Westview Press, 1991, ISBN 0-201-31596-3.<br>
<B> Suggested reading: </B> 
Michael Spivak, <i>Calculus on manifolds</i>.
<BR><br>


<B> Brief organizational description: </B> 
The lecturing time is cut in half and the remaining time is devoted to `guided
discovery' of the material. In other words, in small groups, you will
investigate relevant examples, details, proofs etc. The emphasis
will be on the student participation and interaction, 
on discovery and appreciation of the subject, 
and on rigorous writing/formulation of the arguments. <BR><br>


<B> Grading policy: </B> <BR><br>
40% homework (assigned weekly, due Monday);<br>
10% class participation;<br>
20% midterm exam (TBA, beginning of February);<br>
30% comprehensive final exam (TBA).

<BR><BR>


<b> Homework: </b> It will be posted on:

   </center>
<!--
Late homework is not permitted for any reason!
-->
<br><br>

<b> x-hour: </b> It will be held every week.
<br><br>

<!--
<b> Quizzes: </b> Will be announced a week in advanced. They do not count
towards the final grade, but would be helpful to monitor your progress in 
understanding the material.
<br><br>
-->

<B> Pieces of advice: </B> <br>
(1) Work hard from the very beginning. Do 
<I> not </I> let the material accumulate without working through it.
<BR><br> (2) Do not hesitate to ask me questions (during the class
and after class). Come to the office hours.
<BR><br> (3) Read the <i>honor principle</i> of Dartmouth College. 
Working in small groups you will discuss among yourselves the ideas
of the course, but the homework and the exams 
should reflect your <I> own </I> understanding of the subject.

<BR><BR>
I wish you an enjoyable and fruitful semester!
<br>
