In this class we will give a rigorous definitionof what a "proof" is and we will learn what it means when we saythat a theorem is "true".  We will learn exactly when and whythings we prove are true and exactly when and why we can findproofs for true statements.  We will learn what a "paradox" is andhow the curious phenomenon of self-referentiality led to Godel'sfamous Incompleteness Theorems.  <br> This is not an honors levelclass although some of the material we will be treating issophisticated.  The prerequisites for this course (which will beuseful) are calculus, familiarity with vector spaces, and lightexperience with writing mathematical proofs.  Exceptions can bemade but only after talking with the instructor. Studentsinterested in taking the honors version of this course (beingoffered next school year) should also consult the instructor.<br><br><!-- Textbook separator --><table bgcolor=#ff9900 border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left><a name="textbk"></a>Textbook</th> </table> <p><!-- Textbook information --><TABLE CELLPADDING=8><TR> <TD><img src="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m39f05/FIML.jpg"></TD> <TD> <I>Friendly Introduction to Mathematical Logic </I> <br> byChristopher C.

I suggest that you search online for the best price.<br>The publisher gives the following description of the book: <br>"With the idea that mathematical logic is absolutely<i>central</i> to mathematics, this tightly focused, elementarytext discusses concepts that are used by mathematicians in everybranch of the subject—a subject with increasing applications andintrinsic interest. It features an inviting writing style and amathematical approach with precise statements of theorems andcorrect proofs. Students are introduced to the main results ofmathematical logic—results that are central to the understandingof mathematics as a whole." </P><BR><BR><!-- Homework policy separator --><table bgcolor=#ff9900 border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left><A NAME="hw"></a>Homework</th> </table> <p>Homework will be assigned daily and collected every Monday at thebeginning of class.  Assignments can be found on the "homework"page of the course website. Late assignments will receive nocredit although I will still grade your work if you desire.Assignments will awarded a grade between 1 and 5 points each.  Therubric I will use for grading the assignments is roughly asfollows:<br><br> 5 points:  The assignment is written up clearly,thoroughly and correctly.  Every problem has a correct andcomplete solution, showing all necessary details and addressingall subtleties.<br><br> 4 points:  Every problem has been attempted.  Most of thesolutions are correct, with at most very minor errors oromissions.  The explanations are all reasonably clear andcomplete.<br><br>3 points:  Every problem has been attempted.  Most of thesolutions are correct although the student may be missing somevital parts of certain arguments or the arguments may not beclearly explained.<br><br>2 points:  One or two problems have not been attempted or the workfor these problems is cursory.  The solutions may be onlypartially correct and the explanations are poorly presented, orthe solution may be a strong attempt at a problem which isentirely wrong.<br><br>1 point:  There appears to be some reasonable attempt at doing theassignment.  Several problems have not been attempted or the workfor these problems is cursory.  The solutions may be onlypartially correct and the explanations are poorly presented, orthe solution includes nonsensical ideas.<br><br><br> Since this is (possibly your first) proof-based course,intense effort will be made to improve your exposition andpresentation of proofs.  For every assignment you turn in, Iexpect that: <br><img src="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m39f05/sq_red.gif" align="left">You use fullsentences with punctuation; <br><img src="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m39f05/sq_red.gif"align="left">Your handwriting is legible or the assignment istyped up; <br><img src="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m39f05/sq_red.gif" align="left">Your name appearsat the top right corner of the front page; <br><imgsrc="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m39f05/sq_red.gif" align="left">The assignment number is written onthe top of the front page; and <br><img src="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m39f05/sq_red.gif"align="left">The pages are stapled together (not dog-eared) andthe paper is not frayed or wrinkled.<br> <br> In other words, I want you to take pride in the work youhand in.  Points may be deducted for any violations of thesestandards.  I encourage you to consult the departmental writingeditor, <A href="mailto:Jane.Whittington@dartmouth.edu"> JaneWhittington</A>, for guidance on writing-up assignments.<p> <br><!-- Group Work policy separator --><table bgcolor=#ff9900 border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left><A NAME="gpwork"></a>Group Work</th> </table> <p>Some days of lecture will include some time for group work.  Iwill pass out a worksheet or post problems on the board to beworked on during class. The solutions will occasionally (but notalways) be collected.  You will get points for every groupassignment based <b>not</b> on whether you finished or got all theright answers, but rather that <b>everyone in your group workedtogether and understood every argument that was written down</b>.I will post solutions to every group assignment on the group workwebpage for those who are interested in seeing the solutions.<br><br><!-- separator --><table bgcolor=#ff9900 border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left><A NAME="exams"></a>Examinations</th> </table><p>There will be one midterm exam and a final in this course.  <BR><h3>Midterm exam:<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friday, October 28, inclass. <br><BR>Final Exam:<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturday, December 4, locationTBA. </h3> <BR><!-- Pop Quiz separator --><table bgcolor=#ff9900 border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left><A NAME="quiz"></a>Pop Quiz</th> </table> <p>I will be giving a pop quiz one day in class.

However, you mustwrite up homework solutions independently and in your own words.If you consult any person or source other than the coursetextbook, your class notes, or myself, you must acknowledge thesource in your homework write-up.  Failure to do so is an act ofplagiarism.<br><br>For graded work other than homework, I will give specific detailsabout what types of assistance (notes, books, friends, etc.) areacceptable.  Please talk to me immediately if you have anyquestions about whether or not a particular form of assistance isacceptable. </P><BR><BR><!-- Disabilities separator --><table bgcolor=#ff9900 border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left><A NAME="disabilities"></a>Disabilities</th></table><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Students with disabilities who will be takingthis course and may need disability-related classroomaccommodations are encouraged to make an appointment to see me assoon as possible.
