<h2>   Mathematics for the Physical Sciences  - Winter 
2005</h2>

<p>

<b> Text: </b> Mathematics for the Physical Sciences (Term 2),  by Groszek 
and Mook available at Thayer Copy Center in Thayer Dining Hall 
(upstairs).           

<p>
  
<b>Grade</b>: Your 
grade will be determined via  
 homework  (10% of your grade),
a midterm exam  (30% of your grade each),  
and a final exam  (the remaining 60% of your grade)

<p>

The in class part of our midterm  will  held during class on February 9th 
and our final will be on <a 
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/calendars/exams/04-05.html">March 
14th</a> at 8:00 a.m..   You are  expect to be  
free  at these times 
and must discuss any  legitimate  conflicts  with  Instructor  Leibon  <b> 
during  the first week of  class</b>.     

<p>

<b>Class Log:</b>   The homework assignments and exam  dates  can be 
found in the  class <a href="syl.html"> log.</a> 
You will have typically have one  homework assignments due each week 
of the quarter.
Your  homework  will only be graded  if 
we can find your name and the assignment's number on it.  If you intend to 
turn in  multiple pages, then these pages <bf> must </bf> be stapled 
together.   Homework will <bf> never 
</bf>  be accepted late, and any assignment not turned in on time will 
be recorded as a zero. However,  you will be allowed to drop your
lowest  homework score. 

<p>

<b>Honor  Principle</b>: 
On the exams, no help is to be given or received. On the homework, 
collaboration is permitted and encouraged, but NO  COPYING. In other 
words, you  should feel free to talk to other students while you are in 
the process  of thinking  about a problem. However, when it comes time to 
write up your  solutions, 
you must do this by yourself without outside assistance. 

<p>

<b>Students with disabilities</b>:  I  encourage students with
disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases and 
learning disabilities, to discuss  with us  any
appropriate accommodations that 
might be helpful.

<p>

<b> Tutorial Sessions </b>: 
There is a tutorial session every Tuesday  evening  from 
7-9  where you can  receive advice on the course material. 

<p>

<b>X-Session</b>: The X-session may be used to if we get 
behind in the syllabus or we are  forced to cancel lectures.  
 For example,
we will use the X-session on Feb. 8th in order to  take off MLK day
(Jan. 17).



<p>

<b>Rough Syllabus</b> (<a href="syl.html"> Detailed Syllabus </a>):
Integrated Mathematics and Physical Science is a calculus course designed 
especially for students enrolled concurrently in Physics 15 or Physics 13.  
We will make a special effort to connect math topics with applications in  
the physical science and the material you are learning in physics.   Math 
15.1 and 15.2 give the preparation of Math 8 and 13 with the added bonus 
of being with other engineering, physics and 
chemistry majors.  At the heart of math 15.2 is the mathematics needed to 
articulate  
<a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations">Maxwell's 
equations</a>.  After covering 
this core material the course will end with a look into 
various optimization problems and a view of the derivative as a 
matrix. 


<p>
A prerequisite to this course is 15.1 or a good understanding of the 
 <a HREF="../../../m15f04/public_html/files/syl.html"> 
material </a> covered in that course.
