course focuses on the interplay between the art of regularly repeated
patterns and the abstract mathematics that results from close study of
these patterns. &nbsp;Student work displayed on this page shows some of
the artistic results of previous classes, but not the mathematical side
(which will only make sense if you take the course).<br><br></big></span><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 418px; height: 418px;" src="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m5f09/assig5Laura.jpg" alt=""><br></div><span style="font-family: Lucida Calligraphy;"><big><br>Grades
will be based on 6 assignments incorporating both mathematics and art.
&nbsp;There are no exams but there may be some written pieces that
accompany your math/art.&nbsp; These will have equal weight and shall
be graded through a combination of peer and instructor review.
&nbsp;One assignment may be re-done at the end of the course.
&nbsp;Students will submit a portfolio of all their work (math and art
both) on the last day of class.<br><br>Honor principle: All assignments
done with your own hands. &nbsp;Consulting on math questions is ok,
consulting on art is ok. &nbsp;But you must create your own work.<br><br></big></span><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 375px; height: 360px;" src="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m5f09/assig5Dan.jpg" alt=""><br></div><span style="font-family: Lucida Calligraphy;"><big><br>Syllabus (subject to change):<br><br>Week 1: The mandala. &nbsp;Finding, counting &amp; naming symmetries.
