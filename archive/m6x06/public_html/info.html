We will begin with solving systems of linear equations and build upon this as we learn markov chains and mathematical finance.  If time permits we will study game theory and difference equations.  Real world applications will be emphasized and students will have the opportunity to personalize the curriculum to a certain extent.  As it is an important skill in the working world, group work will be a large component of the course.  <p>The prerequisites for this course are familiarity with high school algebra (see the instructor if you are worried about meeting this criterion... chances are, you are going to be fine) and a willingness to learn and participate in the class.  This class does not assume any background in calculus nor will we be covering any calculus unless the individual student decides to pursue this route.  <br><br><!-- Textbook separator --><table bgcolor=#ff9900 border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left><a name="textbk"></a>Textbook</th> </table> <p><!-- Textbook information --><TABLE CELLPADDING=8><TR> <TD><img src="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m6x06/FMA.jpg"></TD> <TD> <I>Finite Math and Its Applications (8th edition) </I> <br> byGoldstein, Schneider, and Siegel <br> Published by Prentice Hall<br> ISBN: 0-13-010705-0 </TD></TR></TABLE> <BR><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The textbook will be available at WheelockBooks.

In fact, every grade you receive in this class will consist of an individual score and a group score.  In the first day of class I will break you into groups of about 3 students each.  You will be expected to study with your group, work on projects with your group and work on in-class assignments with your group.  <p>For projects and homework where you are encouraged to work with your group, the group scores will count for more.  For exams the group scores will be less.  Each assignment, exam and project will outline exactly how the individual and group points will be awarded.  <p>My reason for putting such emphasis on group learning is two-fold.  First, employers are looking for graduates who have experience working in teams.  Through this group work experience you should gain some skills and experience working on projects and carrying your teammates through the learning process.  Second, numerous studies have been done showing that students at all levels perform better when working in group settings.  The advanced students gain a higher level of understanding through reviewing the material with the rest of their group.  Students who become lost in the material have a support network to turn to for the extra help they need.  <p>If at any time your group is having difficulty working together, make an appointment as a group to meet with me.  <p>The in-class group work will consist of several problems related to the course material.  These assignments will not be graded on whether or not your group finishes the assignment, rather on whether or not your group has worked together to make an attempt at the assignment.  Solutions to all group assignments will be posted on Blackboard.  If you are absent from class, you will not be allowed to make-up points for in-class assignments.  There will be more than 5 group assignments but I will only take the top 5 scores for each individual and group grade.  <br><br><!-- Homework policy separator --><table bgcolor=#ff9900 border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left><A NAME="hw"></a>Homework</th> </table> <p><br>Homework will be assigned daily and collected every Monday at thebeginning of class.  Assignments can be found on the "assignments"folder in Blackboard. Late assignments will receive nocredit although I will still grade your work if you desire.Assignments will awarded an individual grade between 1 and 5 points each.    Therubric I will use for grading the assignments is roughly asfollows:<br><br> 5 points:  The assignment is written up clearly,thoroughly and correctly.  Every problem has a correct andcomplete solution, showing all necessary details and addressingall subtleties.<br><br> 4 points:  Every problem has been attempted.  Most of thesolutions are correct, with at most very minor errors oromissions.  The explanations are all reasonably clear andcomplete.<br><br>3 points:  Every problem has been attempted.  Most of thesolutions are correct although the student may be missing somevital parts of certain arguments or the arguments may not beclearly explained.<br><br>2 points:  One or two problems have not been attempted or the workfor these problems is cursory.  The solutions may be onlypartially correct and the explanations are poorly presented, orthe solution may be a strong attempt at a problem which isentirely wrong.<br><br>1 point:  There appears to be some reasonable attempt at doing theassignment.  Several problems have not been attempted or the workfor these problems is cursory.  The solutions may be onlypartially correct and the explanations are poorly presented, orthe solution includes nonsensical ideas.<br><br><br> For every assignment you turn in, Iexpect that: <br><img src="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m6x06/sq_red.gif" align="left">You use fullsentences with correct punctuation; <br><img src="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m6x06/sq_red.gif" align="left">Your handwriting is legible or the assignment istyped up; <br><img src="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m6x06/sq_red.gif" align="left">Your name appears at the top right corner of the front page; <br><img src="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m6x06/sq_red.gif" align="left">The assignment number is written on the top of the front page; and <br><img src="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m6x06/sq_red.gif" align="left">The pages are stapled together (not dog-eared) andthe paper is not frayed or wrinkled.<br> <br> In other words, I want you to take pride in the work youhand in.  Points may be deducted for any violations of thesestandards. <br><br><!-- Exams separator --><table bgcolor=#ff9900 border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left><A NAME="exams"></a>Examinations</th> </table><p>There will be two quizzes and a final in this course.  <BR><h3>Quiz 1:<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monday, July 17 inclass. <br><BR>Quiz 2:<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monday, August 7 inclass. <br><BR>Final Exam:<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturday, August 27 at 8am, locationTBA. </h3> <BR><!--Projects separator --><table bgcolor=#ff9900 border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 width=100%><th align=left><A NAME="proj"></a>Projects</th> </table> <p><p>There will be 2 projects in this class.

However, you mustwrite up homework solutions in your own words.If you consult any person or source other than the coursetextbook, your group, your class notes, or myself, you must acknowledge thesource in your homework write-up.  Failure to do so is an act ofplagiarism.<br><br>For graded work other than homework, I will give specific detailsabout what types of assistance (your group, notes, books, me, etc.) areacceptable.
