<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">FINAL EXAM</span>:
The final will be comprehensive and therefore covers everything that we
have discussed in lecture and covered in the homework.&nbsp; The final
will be closed book.&nbsp; There is no "take home" portion.&nbsp; No
calculators or computing devices are allowed.&nbsp; The final is
Monday, August 31st, from 8 am to 11 am in 105 Kemeny Hall (our usual
classroom).<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">EXAM TWO RESULTS</span>:
As a whole the class did very well on the second exam.&nbsp; There is
still way to much sloppy work as well as unjustified assertions and
poor use of language.&nbsp; There is less and less sympathy for such
things as the term progresses.<br>
</small>

  <small> </small>
  <li><small>Here is the distribution of scores on the <a
 target="_main" href="exam2-dist.pdf">second exam</a>.</small></li>
  <small> </small>
  <li><small>Here are some terse <a target="_main"
 href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m22x09/exam2-soln.pdf">solutions</a>
to the second exam.</small></li>
  <small> </small>
  <li><small>An estimate of your grade to date can be obtained as
follows.&nbsp; I wrote a score, out of 60, on the second page of your
exam for your homework to date.&nbsp; Add this to both your exam grades
to get a number out of 260.&nbsp; Then a <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">crude
estimate</span> is given as follows:</small></li>
  <small> </small>
  <ul>
    <small> </small>
    <li><small>A: 221-260</small></li>
    <small> </small>
    <li><small>B: 190-220</small></li>
    <small> </small>
    <li><small>C: 165-189.<br>
      </small></li>
    <small> </small>
  </ul>
  <small></small>
</ul>
<small><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">EXAM TWO:</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>The second exam will be given on
Monday (August 10th) during our regular class time.&nbsp; The take-home
portion will be due Wednesday (August 12th) at the beginning of
class.&nbsp; The exam will cover through and including Wednesday's
lecture on August 5th.&nbsp; It will emphasize material covered since
the first exam.&nbsp; This means sections 4.1 -- 4.7, the material on
the matrix of a linear transformation covered in lecture based on part
of section 5.4 and sections 3.1 and 3.2 on determinants.&nbsp; Of
course, material from the first part of the course, such as the
Invertible Matrix Theorem, may be useful.<span
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); text-decoration: underline;"><br>
<br>
Unlike the first exam</span>, the take home portion (as well as the in
class portion) will be <span
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); text-decoration: underline;">closed book
and closed notes</span>.&nbsp; Also, <span
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); text-decoration: underline;">no
calculators or computing devices</span> are allowed.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Remember that your solutions to the take home portion are to be written
on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one side</span> of 8.5" x
11" paper with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">each problem
started on a new page</span>.</small>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">EXAM ONE RESULTS</span>:
On the whole, the class did very well on a difficult exam.&nbsp; My
biggest critizism is that some of the work was sloppy.&nbsp; Messy work
is (somewhat) understandable if you are under time pressure, but there
is no excuse on a take home exam where writing is a critical componet
of the grade.&nbsp; Just as in any writing assignment, I should not be
seeing your first draft; I should be seeing the polished finished
product.&nbsp; I will be much less tolerant on future exams.&nbsp;
Also, you must learn to use mathematical terminology correctly.&nbsp;
That is part of learning the definitions.<br>

  <small> </small>
  <li><small>To estimate your progress in the course so far, I have
marked a
score out of 20 on the front of your exam.&nbsp; This reflects your
first four homeworks.&nbsp; If you add this to your exam score, then
you get a number out of 120 points.&nbsp; Based on this total, a very
crude approximation of your grade to date is given as follows:</small></li>
  <small> </small>
  <ul>
    <small> </small>
    <li><small>A: 97-120.</small></li>
    <small> </small>
    <li><small>B: 80-96.</small></li>
    <small> </small>
    <li><small>C: 70-79.<br>
      </small></li>
    <small> </small>
  </ul>
  <small></small>
</ul>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">EXAM
ONE</span>: The first exam will on Thursday (July 23rd) during our
x-hour.&nbsp;
There will also be a take-home portion due Friday at the beginning of
lecture.&nbsp; The exam will cover through and including Monday's
lecture on July 20th.&nbsp; It is not likely that homeworked turned in
on Monday the 20th will be returned before the exam.&nbsp; Plan
accordingly.&nbsp; Since some of you asked, I have put together a few
practice questions.&nbsp; You are free to use them or not.&nbsp; For
