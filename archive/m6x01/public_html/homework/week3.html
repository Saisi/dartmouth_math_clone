<p>

Note:  You are welcome to use any resources to solve these questions.  Just be sure to write your solution in your own words and reference sources that you use.

<p>

Suppose a class consists of fifty people.  What is the probability that two of these people have the same birthday?  (Ignore leap years - so assume a year has 365 days.)

<p>

Be sure to explain your reasoning carefully.

<P>

<! (2)  (The Monty Hall Problem)Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car, behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say number 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say number 3, which has a goat. He says to you, "Do you want to pick door number 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice of doors?  >
