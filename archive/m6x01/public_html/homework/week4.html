<p>

In addition one of the following four questions will be on the quiz:

<p>(1)  Explain how the formula for P(n,r) is derived.

<p>(2)  Explain how the formula for C(n,r) is derived.

<p>(3)  Illustrate the Multiplication Principle with an example including a tree diagram.

<p>(4)  What is the probability of an event?  (List two key principles.)

<p>

The quiz will be 30 minutes long and will be worth 25 points.  See the syllabus and schedule for further information.


<P>

Note:  Chapter 5 Practice Test problems 1e and 2a as well as Chapter 6 Practice Test problems 2, 3, 10 and 11 are on material we did not cover.  If you use these tests to practice, skip these problems.

Essay question due 7/16:

<p>

<b>Note:  You are welcome to use any resources to solve these questions.  Just be sure to write your solution in your own words and reference sources that you use.</b>

<p>

(The Monty Hall Problem) Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car, behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say number 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say number 3, which has a goat. He says to you, "Do you want to pick door number 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice of doors?  

<p>

I encourage you to use other textbooks or the web in answering this question.  Just heed the note above and be aware that there is no math web police checking the validity of posted solutions.
