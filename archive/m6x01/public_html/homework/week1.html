<p>

Suggestions for writing:  If you explained your solution to an essay question to your roomate or to your family, you would use words and sentences to communicate.  Think of your write-up of these questions as a transcription of these conversations.  Describe the problem and your response to it in a way that reads like a page from a textbook.

<P>

<font color = "red">I made some copies of an example of an 'essay' style write-up of a homework question.  It is in the box outside of my office.</font>  It is also available online <A href = "essayexa.html">here</A>. 

<P>

Question due 6/25:  Example 3 on p. 202 shows that a three element set has eight subsets.  (Note that if A is a set, both the empty set and A itself are counted as subsets of A.)

<br>

How many subsets does a two element set have?  What about a four element set?  Can you find a pattern?  How many subsets does a set with <i>n</i> elements have?
