<l>

<li>Assigned Monday 7/30 and due 8/1:

<P>

Read 9.1 and 3.1.

<p>

Complete the following problems:

<P>

12.4:  10, 11

<p>

12.5:  3, 16, 18(in honor of parents weekend)

<!8>
<P>

Additional problems: 

<ol>

<li>In 12.4 on p.554 there is a table (#2) listing logical implications.  Show that the sixth one, Hypothetical syllogism, is valid.  It may help to refer to the definition of logical implication on p. 553 and the example in class.

<p>

<li>Translate "If you are a good singer then my initials are G. W. B." into a logically equivalent statement involving a disjunction.  Then apply one of De Morgan's laws to express this new statement as a negation of a conjunction.  Your answers should be in words, not in symbols.

</ol>

<P>

Essay question due 8/6:

<p>

The statements below form another of Lewis Carroll's logic puzzles.  Write a careful proof of what these statements imply.  (You are welcome to write a two column proof as part of this essay question.  Just be sure that your choice of symbols, statements, and reasons are easily understood by the reader.)

<p>

The puzzle came from the <a href = "http://home.earthlink.net/~lfdean/carroll/puzzles/index.html"><u>Lewis Carrol E-text Collection</u></a>.  Check this link for more logic puzzles of many different types.

<p>

<ol>

<li>The only animals in this house are cats; 
<li>Every animal is suitable for a pet, that loves to gaze at the moon; 
<li>When I detest an animal, I avoid it; 
<li>No animals are carnivorous, unless they prowl at night; 
<li>No cat fails to kill mice; 
<li>No animals ever take to me, except what are in this house; 
<li>Kangaroos are not suitable for pets; 
<li>None but carnivors kill mice; 
<li>I detest animals that do not take to me; 
<li>Animals, that prowl at night, always love to gaze at the moon. 

</ol>

<li>Assigned Wednesday 8/1 and due 8/3:

<P>

Read 9.2 and refresh your memory about material in 1.1 and 1.2.  Please note that when graphing linear inequalities, the book shades points that DO NOT satisfy the inequality.  This is contrary to convention - we'll discuss it in class on Friday.

<p>

As mentioned in class also read through 3.1.

<p>

Complete the following problems:

<p>

12.2:  20  For this problem be sure to list the truth values for p, q, and r in the standard way for three proposition truth tables.  What do these truth tables say about these statements?  What is the name for this property?

<p>

(Note:  For an example of this standard listing see p. 17 table 4 in the handout.  Also make sure you understand the standard way to construct one and two proposition truth tables.  If this does not make sense, ask me!)

<p>

12.5:  5, 6

<p>

9.1:  2, 4, 7, 10.

<p>

<!9.1:  6, 8, 12>
