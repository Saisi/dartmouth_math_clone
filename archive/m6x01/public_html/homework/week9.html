<li>Assigned Monday 8/13 and due 8/15:

<P>

<a href = "week8.html#current"><u>Test 2 Review Information</u></a> is posted below Friday's homework on the Week 8 homework page.

<P>

Complete the following problems:

<P>

Web problem 1:  Refer to the election data given in the table at the top of p. 184 in the handout.  

<p>

(a) Assume that all voters give one approval vote each to their first and second choices.  Who wins? 

<p>

(b) Now assume that all voters give their first choice one approval vote, and half of the voters give their second choice one approval vote.  (Round fractions of votes up.)  Who wins?

<p>

Web problem 2:  Refer to the handout `Paradoxes of Preferential Voting' from class today.  As recommended, you may skip the bracketed sections.  On p. 210 there is a note next to a paragraph that explains how Mrs. Smith found a failure of monotonicity in the election.  (The paragraph begins `On the night before...')  Explain this irregularity in detail.

<P>

<li>Assigned Wednesday 8/15:

<P>

There is no assignment for today.  I'll be available during the x-hour tomorrow for questions.  

<P>

Note:  Friday is our last class meeting so there will be no test corrections on the second test.
