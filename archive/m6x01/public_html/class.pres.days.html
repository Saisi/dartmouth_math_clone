<B><P>TIMING:</B>  View the cycle of the class as a sequence of Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, MWFMWF&#133;.  Your pair will be responsible for one class.  The timing will be as follows:</P>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>As a pair, meet with me to discuss your class.  This will occur on the day which is 'two days' in the class cycle before the day you teach.</LI></UL>
</UL>



<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Submit a write-up of your plans for the class by 5pm on the day one day before your class <U>in the class cycle</U>.  (So that is two actual days before your class.  Do not submit a plan the afternoon before your class -- that won't give me enough time to give you feedback about it.) Blitz the plan to me, or slide it under my office door.</LI></UL>
</UL>



<UL>

<UL>
<LI>EXAMPLE:  Eugene and Carl's class is on Wednesday, August 1<SUP>st</SUP>.  So they'll meet with me the preceding Friday (7/27) and their plans will be due by 5pm on the preceding Monday (7/30).</LI></UL>
</UL>


<P>I will be around starting at 8 am each class day.  If you need copies made you can bring originals by at that time or slide them under my office door the preceding evening.</P>

<B><P>FORMAT:</B>  You probably have noticed that at the beginning of every class I write a simple outline of what we'll cover that day.  For your presentation day I'll construct such an outline and you will be responsible for presenting parts of it.  Because the material varies, the amount of presentation that groups will be responsible for will vary.</P>

<B><P>MEETINGS:  </B>In our meeting two cycle days before your class we'll do two things.  First we will discuss the material for your class and answer questions that you might have about it.  Familiarize yourself with the material before coming to the meeting.  Second I will let you know what the class outline will look like and which parts you will need to cover.</P>

<B><P>GRADING:</B>  This project is worth 25 points in total and they will be broken down as follows:</P>

<U><P>Missed meeting  -5 points  </P>
</U>
<U><P>Class plan 10 points</U>:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>4 - <U>Details of material that will be presented.</U>  If you plan to present material to the class include notes for that presentation.  If you will use worksheets include a copy of each worksheet.  Also indicate who will be doing what.</P>
<U>
</U><P>3 - <U>Includes all topics to be covered.</U>  During the meeting I will indicate to you the topics and ideas that you will need to cover.  From reading your plans I should be able to find all of these topics.</P>

<P>3 - <U>Describes how class participation will be included.</U>  During your part of class you will need to check in with everyone to be sure they are following along.  This can be done with questions, group exercises, and individual exercises among other things.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<U><P>Class 15 points</U>:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>4 - <U>Clarity.</U>  This includes not only the clarity of exposition, but also writing legibly on the board, speaking loudly, making sure directions are explained well.</P>

<P>3 - <U>Organization</U>.  Lectures, worksheets and other materials are prepared and ready to go.  Presenters know what should happen when and who should be doing it.</P>

<P>3 - <U>Completeness</U>.  All topics discussed in the meeting are covered within the time allotted.  </P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<B><P>WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME?</P>
</B>

<P>

<ul>

<li>To be able to explain a topic to others requires solid understanding of that topic.  You will really KNOW the material if you present it.

<p>


<LI>As seen in office hours, often students can explain ideas to other students much more effectively than professors can.  The perspective of having recently learned the material can be very useful in explaining it.

<P>


<LI>Yet again this is a chance to gain skill speaking in mathematical language and presenting technical material to others.</LI></UL>


<B><P>BUILD YOUR OWN FINAL EXAM:</P>
<U>
</B></U><P>If in the course of preparing your class you should come across questions that seem appropriate for a final exam please let me know.  I won't guarantee that I'll use them, but I just might.</P></FONT></BODY>
