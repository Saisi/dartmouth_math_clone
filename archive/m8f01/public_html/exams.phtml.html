<H3> Calculator Policy on Exams</H2>
First, it should be understood that exams are designed so that
calculators are of little use.  In fact, they may be counter
productive:  if an answer is sqrt(2), and you list 1.414, you are
wrong.  If you find yourself inseparable from your calculator, you may bring
it, but subject to the following conditions:
<P>
You may only use the very basic functions of your calculator.  The
following are explicitly <B>prohibited</B>:
<UL>
<LI>Using any graphing capabilities of your calculator (no plotting of
graphs, direction fields, etc)
<LI>Using any symbolic manipulation capabilities (symbolic
integration, differentiation, mulitplication of polynomials or complex
numbers)
<LI>Using your calculator to store formulas or other crib notes
</UL>

<B>Deviation from this policy will
be considered a violation of the honor code.</B>

<H3>First Midterm Exam</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Date:  Monday, October 22
<LI>Material covered:  Day 1 - Day 10 assignments
<LI>Time: 4 - 6 pm (We write a one-hour exam and give you two hours to
do it).  
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="red">Note:  </FONT></B>If you <B>have a lab</B>
or other valid <B>regularly scheduled academic commitment</B>,
alternate arrangements will be provided. In short, you will be able to
take the exam from 6 - 8pm on the same day, but in a different room.
<B>Contact your instructor</B> for details.
<LI>Rooms to be assigned based on the lecture in which you <B>are
officially enrolled</B>.  You will get a note confirming this.  The
breakdown will be:
<UL>
<LI>Arkowitz:  101 Bradley
<LI>Baumgartner:  Cook Auditorium
<LI>Shemanske:  Cook Auditorium
</UL>
This is being done since Math 8 is too large to fit in either room
alone.  The exams for all sections are identical, and will be graded
by all of us together, so this arrangement is solely to guarantee
adequate seating.  Please arrive in time to be settled by 4pm, and sit
with one empty seat between you and your neighbor(s).

<LI>Bring pencils or pens; none are provided.  There will be adequate
scrap paper; you may not use your own.
</UL>
<BR>
<B>Finally</B>, there will be a Q & A (question and answer) period to
be held Sunday, October 21 from 4 - 6pm in Filene Auditorium in Moore
Hall.  The idea is that you provide the questions, and we shall answer
them.  If you plan to attend, come at the beginning.  Questions which
have been answered once will not be answered again until all new
questions have been dealt with.

<LI>The room assignments are more complicated for the final, since we

with room for one empty chair between two students, so adhere rigidly
to the assignments below, and seat yourselves with one empty seat
between you and your neighbor(s).
