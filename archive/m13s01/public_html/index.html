<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Math 13: Calculus of Vector-Valued Functions</H1>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Spring 2001</H2>
<P><HR></P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Instructor: Thomas F. Bickel <BR>
Lecture times: MWF 12:30-1:35 <BR>
X-hour: Tu 1:00-1:50 <BR>
Classroom: 113 Silsby</H4>
<B><P>Office Hours:</B><I> </I>412 Bradley: office hours Tuesday and Thursday, 2-3 p.m., and by arrangement. I also take questions by BlitzMail; I read it regularly during week days from 8 am to 5 pm, rarely evenings, usually once or twice each weekend. It will help me if you include the phrase Math 13 in the subject line (i.e. Math 13 question).</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Textbook:</B><I> Basic Multivariable Calculus </I>by Marsden, Tromba and Weinstein; available at the bookstores. This book has also been used in fall and winter terms, so used copies should be available for those who would like them.  We will cover the entire text except for Chapter 3; the material in Chapter 1 and (to some extent) Chapter 2 has been covered in Math 8 and will be quickly reviewed.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Exams:</B> Two hour exams, in class on Monday, April 23 and Monday, May 14. The final examination will cover all material in the course; the date of the final will be announced about the fourth week of the term. </P>
<P><BR>
<B>Class Web page:</B> At the URL of &lt;http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m13s01&gt; is a Web page for this class. Homework assignments will be listed there shortly after each class period, plus additional key information such as sections to be covered on the hour exams shortly before each exam. </P>
<P><BR>
<B>Homework:</B> Assigned daily, due the next class period. Homework is to be turned in by 3 p.m. in the boxes labelled Math 13 on the Gerry Hall side of 101 Bradley Auditorium (access easiest from Berry library cafeteria).  Each assignment will be graded on a basis of 2 points for essentially all correct work, 1 point for work that is mostly complete but may have some errors, 0 for work that is turned in but not very good. The homework score will only be used in the final grade in case of someone right on the borderline between grades. No work will be graded that is more than one class period late.</P>
<P><BR>
<B>Tutorials:</B> There will be tutorial help available on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday evenings, 6:30 - 8:00 p.m. in 104 Gerry. Hector Rosario, a mathematics graduate student, will be the tutor.</P>
<B><P>Course grade:</B> Will be based on the hour exams (30% each) and the final exam (40%).</P>
<B><P>Honor principle:</B> You may discuss the homework with one another. However, in each assignment turned in you must have done the majority of the actual mathematical work, and all of the write-up, independently. Obviously no collaboration is allowed on the exams. </P>
<B><P>Special needs:</B> Any student with a documented disability needing academic adjustments or accommodations is requested to speak to me by the end of the second week of the term.  All discussions will remain confidential, although the Student Disabilities Coordinator my be consulted to verify the documentation of the disability.</P>
