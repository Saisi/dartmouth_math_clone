What's the best way to implement a courtordered public school busing program? Given the current marketconditions which product line leads to the greatest profitability forour company? These are examples of questions that people are facedwith every day and the optimal solutions are usually never clear - ifthey even exist. One tool that is often implemented to aid in thedecision making process is mathematical programming. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Mathematical programming is amethod for abstracting the salient features of a problem in a waythat makes the scenario amenable to mathematical analysis. In thiscourse we will study mathematical programs of the linear variety. Wewill begin by learning what a linear program is and how we canconvert real world problems into this paradigm. We will then focus onthe simplex method - a standard technique for solving linearprograms. Our study of the simplex method will lead us intodiscussions of duality theory, implementation issues, measuring theefficiency of algorithms, and other related topics. After thesediscussions we will study applications of linear programming to someof the following: game theory, network flows and data envelopinganalysis (DEA). If time permits we will also address integerprogramming and interior point methods.</FONT></P><P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Target Audience:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">This course may be ofinterest to students majoring in mathematics, computer science andthe social sciences who would like to explore a mathematical approachto decision making </FONT><B><I><FONT SIZE="+1"COLOR="#000000">and</FONT></I></B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">also have an interest in understanding the theory behind thetechniques employed.</FONT></P><P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Prerequisites: </FONT></B><FONTSIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">Math 6, 8 or 9, some knowledge of matrixalgebra and solving systems of linear equations, and mathematicalmaturity.</FONT></P><P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000">SpecialConcerns:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000000"> If you have anyspecial concerns you should speak to me as soon as possible.
