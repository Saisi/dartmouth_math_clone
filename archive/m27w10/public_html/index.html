Have you ever wondered why medical schools require calculus? Or why
biology has recently been described as "the most mathematical science"?
&nbsp;Math 4/27 will show how real researchers in medicine and biology
use mathematical models to predict change and design strategies for
controlling epidemics, administering drugs, managing ecosystems.
&nbsp;Using basic calculus and a free application, <a href="../../../~matc/eBookshelf/calculus/BigGreen.html">The Big Green Ordinary Differential Equation Machine</a>, you can study a multitude of real situations. &nbsp;<br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Math 4</span> is for students with one semester of calculus at least. &nbsp;We
use a text book developed especially for this course. &nbsp;See the
Biology Department web site for how this course fits into prerequisites
for the Biology major. &nbsp;The goal of Math 4 is to enable students
to read critically and think about the research literature in medical
and biological modeling with differential equations. &nbsp; <br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Math 27</span> is for students with more mathematical background. &nbsp;Math
22 or the equivalent is a required prerequisite for Math 27. &nbsp;The goal of Math 27 is
to enable students to conduct their own independent research projects
in mathematical biology after completing the course, if they so desire. &nbsp; <br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Both</span> courses meet in the same room at the same time. &nbsp;The
difference is that in Math 4 we will prepare to read the research
literature, finally doing so around week 5 or 6. &nbsp;In Math 27 we
will be reading the research literature from the start of the course.
&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Grading:</span> In both courses the grades will be based on 3 papers, however the
topics will be different. &nbsp;All three papers are weighted equally.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attendance:</span>
This
quarter we meet T-Th 10-11:50 and Wed 3-4:15. &nbsp;We spend class time
on many examples and case studies not included in the text. We will use
the
Wednesday time slot to participate in a research seminar in
mathematical biology (timed this way just for you). &nbsp;Students from
Math 23 (Differential equations) may also attend and participate in the
seminar, as well as students engaged in independent study in
mathematical biology. &nbsp;Attendance at the x-hour is required of
Math 27 students each week, and of Math 4 students on certain days (to
be announced). &nbsp;Do not schedule other activities during this time.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Text</span>:
Math 4 is
using the latest version of Situated Complexity (rewritten from last
year's text but do not use the old version). &nbsp;You will be able to
purchase a copy the first week
of class from the math department main office. &nbsp;Math 27 is using
Mathematical Biology by Murray. &nbsp;Math 27 students are also invited
to get a copy of the Math 4 text, extras will be available.<br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Honor principle: </span>All authors must contribute substantially to any paper
with their names on it. &nbsp;All sources must be appropriately cited.
&nbsp;Any suspicion of plagiarism will be forwarded to the COS.<br><p><b>Religious observance</b>: Some students may wish to take part
in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you
have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in
the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of
the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.
