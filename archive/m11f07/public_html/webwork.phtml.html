<h3>General Information about WeBWorK</h3>
</center>

<blockquote><p><p>

<h3> I. What is WeBWorK ? </h3>

<em>WeBWorK</em> is a system that allows students to do their homework
in an interactive web-based environment.

<br> 
<br>
Using <em>WeBWorK</em>, students may try to answer homework problems
more than once.  After each try, a message appears telling the student
whether the answer is correct or not.  This provides immediate
feedback to the students, allows them to discover what they did wrong,
and hopefully alows them to understand the topic of the question
better.
<br>
<br>
Each <EM>WeBWorK</EM> problem set is individualized. Each student has
a different version of a problem generated from a fixed template; for
example the numerical values in the formulas may be slightly
different). <p><p>

<H3> II.  How anybody can try out WeBWorK</H3><p><p>

Anyone with an internet connection can try out WeBWorK by following
the directions in Part III below. Use <STRONG>practice1</STRONG> as
the <STRONG>login name</STRONG> and <STRONG>practice1</STRONG> again
as the <STRONG>password</STRONG>. To see different problems, you can
login as practice2, practice3, or practice4 and use the login name for
the password.<p>

<H3> III.  How to use WeBWorK to do your homework</H3><p><p>

  Using <EM>WeBWorK</EM> is quite simple.<BR>
  
 Below are the basic steps on how to get started.<BR><BR>
  <STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> Most pages of <EM>WeBWorK</EM> also contain
  directions.  Therefore, if you are ever unsure of what you should
  do, try reading the directions and descriptions on the page at which
  you are looking.<BR> 

<OL>
<LI>You can use any computer with a browser like IE, Firefox or Opera.  In
general, it is not possible to use a text-based browser like lynx
since most of the mathematics is rendered using a  graphic format.


<li>Open your browsesr and go to the
  main <em>WeBWorK</em> page, address
  <a href="https://webwork.dartmouth.edu/webwork2/m11f07/">
   https://webwork.dartmouth.edu/webwork2/m11f07/</a>.
  
<li>This will get you to the main page of your course.  This page
  includes necessary information about logging in.  <br>
  To log in, click on the 'Login' button.

<li>This will take you to a login page.  Enter your
  login name and password, and click on the 'Continue' button.<br>
  Your <strong>login name</strong> is the usually just your last name,
  followed possibly by a digit for people in the class with the same
  last name (e.g. smith, smith2, ...)). Possible exceptions include
  compound last name like "den Hartog" or "De La Huerta" which would
  be rendered Hartog and Huerta respectively.


 
<li>If your login is incorrect, you will be told so, and you can
  return to the login page and try again.

<li>If you are registered for the course, you should receive and email
  from your instructor confirming your login and password.


<br> If your login is
  correct you will see a page where you can do following:
  
<ul type=dot>
  <li><strong>Look at and do the problems in a set via the bowser interface.</strong><br>
  
  To do the first days assignment, for example, click on the line in
  the box that starts with 'f07hw1'.  Then click on the 'Do problem
  set' button.<br> On each line in the box, where all the sets are
  listed, after the set number, you can see whether the set is open or
  closed.  If the set is open, that means that when you solve a
  problem, it will be counted towards your grade.  If the set is
  closed, you can still solve problems, but your results will not be
  recorded.  <br> After the indication of whether the set is open or
  closed, there is additional information about the due date (if the
  set is open), or whether the answers are available (if the set is
  closed).  

<!-- 
When the answers are available, you have the option of
  looking at correct answers when viewing a problem.
-->
  
  
  <li><strong>Get a printout of the problem set.</strong><br> 

  To print out f07hw1, for example, first choose the download type.
  THe default of pdf is probably what you want, although you may have
  to configure your browser to use Adobe's Acrobat Reader to view (and
  print) the files. 
 
<br> After choosing one of the download types, click on the line in
  the box that starts with 'f07hw1...'.  Then click on the 'Get hard
  copy' button. A couple of things may happen at this point.  If your
  browser is set up to handle pdf documents, your browser window will
  fill with the homework set in it as a document.  In this case, go to
  the icon 'file' and choose the 'print' option.  If your browser is
  not properly configured, you may get an alert message asking what to
  with the file.  In this case, you can save the file to disk (so that
  you can print it at a later time), choose an application to view or
  print the file (e.g. GSview or dropPS for postscript or Acrobat
  Reader for pdf).  Any of the computer consultants show be able to
  help you with this kind of problem.

 <p>
    
  
  <li><strong>Look at a summary of your WeBWorK homework
  scores.</strong><br> This is the second section of the page.  If you
  click on the button 'Get Summary', you will see your current scores
  for all available problem sets.  </ul><br>
  
  <li>If you are printing out a problem set or looking at a summary of
  your homework scores, you are done.  If you are viewing a problem
  set via Netscape, you will see a page with the problems in the set
  you chose.  To view and/or answer a problem, click on the number of
  the problem and click on the 'Get Problem' button.  Notice that
  there are four modes of viewing the problem: 'text',
  'formatted-text' and 'typeset', adn typeset2.  It is best to view
  the problem using 'typeset2' mode, which should be the default. Once
  you choose a problem and click on the 'Get Problem' button, you will
  see the text of the problem with boxes for your answers.  Enter your
  answers and click on the 'Submit Answer' button.  If you are working
  on a problem set that is already closed, you will have the option to
  see the correct answer or a solution if one is available (currently
  only a few problems have solutions available).  To see the correct
  answer and/or solution, just check the box(es) and click on the
  'Submit Answer' button (you do not have to enter an answer to see
  the correct answer or solution).  Once you have submitted an answer,
  you will be told whether your answer is correct or not.  If not, you
  can try again.  After you've tried a problem, you can either go to
  the next problem, the previous problem, or see the list of the
  problems again.  

<li>If you want to check the status of your
  problems (e.g. to double check that your answers have been
  recorded), use the &quot;Prob. List&quot; button at the top of the
  page to see the problem list page.  

<li> When you are finished, log
  out using the &quot;Logout&quot; button at the bottom of the page.
  <li>That's all, folks!
