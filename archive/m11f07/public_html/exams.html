<h1>Math 11 Exam 2</h1>

<ul>

  <li>Here are some brief <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m11f07/exam2-sol.pdf">solutions</a> to the second exam.</li>

  <li>Here is the <a href="exam2-dist.pdf">distribution of scores</a> on the second exam.</li>

  <li>To get an <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">estimate</span>
of your grade in the course to date, we have written the sum of your
first two exam scores plus a score out of 35 based on your WeBWork,
written homework and quiz scores. &nbsp;As always this score was
computed based half on you quiz scores and half on the sum of your
WeBWork scores and written homework scores. &nbsp;You can estimate your
grade to date as follows. &nbsp;(Notice that we have not addressed "+"s
and "-"s.)</li>

  
  <ul>

    <li>A: 208-235</li>

    <li>B: 170-207</li>

    <li>C: 151-169</li>

    <li>D: 120-149</li>

  
  </ul>

  <li>Since we have had some issues with lost written homeworks, we
have also written the number of missing written homework assignments on
your exam (up through and including the assignment due on 11/5). &nbsp;If this number seems incorrect, you will have to
discuss the matter with your instruction. &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">No one will be penalized for missing homework that they turned in on time</span>.</li>

  <li>Here are some brief solutions to the first exam: <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m11f07/exam1-solns.pdf">click here</a>.</li>



  <li>Here is a hist-o-gram of the scores on the first exam: <a href="exam1-dist.pdf">click here</a>.</li>



  <li>To get a rough idea of where you stand in the course to date, you
can do the following. &nbsp;On each of your exams, we marked a grade,
computed out of 20 points, that reflects your performance on WeBWork,
the quizzes and the written homework. &nbsp;Your raw score on WeBWork
(out of 96) was added to your raw written homework score (out of 50) to
get a number from 0-10. &nbsp;Similarly, your quiz total (out of 11)
was also converted to a number from 0-10. &nbsp;The sum, to the nearest
integer, is your score. &nbsp;Based on the sum of this number and you
exam grade, we <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0); text-decoration: underline;">estimate</span> our current grade as follows. &nbsp;(Notice that we have not made any attempt to allocate "+"s and "-"s.</li>



  
  
  
  <ul>



    <li>A: 108--120</li>



    <li>B: 87--107</li>



    <li>C: 73--86</li>



    <li>D: 60-72</li>
