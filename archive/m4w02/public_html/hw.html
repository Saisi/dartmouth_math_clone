<h2>Math 4  Log</h2>
<hr>
<b> Week 1 (January 7-11) :</b>
<p>
Read chapter 1-3 of the text and carefully read the article on  HIV-1
Dynamics by Perelson et al on pages 15-22 of your text. The first <a
href="assignments/a1.html"> assignment </a> is based on the ideas and
equations in this reading.  The assignment will be due on Friday
January 18th.  On Wednesday we developed our
first method to  <a
href="temps/t1.html"> construct  </a> the solution of a differential
equation as well as stating our  <a
href="thrms/theorem1.html">
fundamental 
</a> theorem concerning these solutions.

Please read carefully chapter 4 and skim chapter 5. 
The first assignment is due Friday.  On Thursday we will have our first
Maple help session in <b> Berry Starr 274 </b>.  The first group 
<a href="assignments/a2.html"> assignment </a> is due Monday February
11th.

<p>
In lecture we are busy exploring basic differential equations like
modifications of the logistic equation.  The following   <a
href="thrms/logistic.html">
theorem 
</a> is very useful for understanding the logistic equation, especially
when we apply it to more complicated phenomena.

<b> Week 3 :</b>
<p>
No X-session.
Please read carefully chapter 5 and skim chapter 6.

In class we have been busy exploring systems of equations like the
Lokta-Voltera system.

 Please read carefully chapter 7. 

In class we have been begun exploring the notion of bifurcation, and have
begun  motivating linear systems and their
relations to non-linear systems and equilibrium point exploration. In
particular we
have begun to explore uses and meaning of  the  <a
href="thrms/theorem2.html">
Linearization </a> theorem.

<b> Week 6 :</b>
<p>
No X-session. Please read carefully chapter 8, and the three reading at
the end of chapter 7.  
The second individual 
<a
href="assignments/a3.html"> assignment </a>    is due next  Friday
(February 22nd).
In class we have begun to explore the 2 by two systems arise in the <a
href="thrms/theorem3.html">
Big Theorem
</a> as well as this theorem's meaning and use.

Please read carefully chapter 11 and skim chapters 9 and 10.  The
version of these chapters which you will need of
is summed up by our  our  <a
href="thrms/theorem3.html">
Big Theorem
</a>.  In class we have been exploring how to use the big theorem 
via the eigenvalues and the <a
href="thrms/theorem4.html">
detection </a> theorem.    
The final group 
<a

In class we are going through some specific epidemic models from the
literate.  In particular your group  will produce some <a
href="assignments/mod.html"> variations   </a> of the De Leo and Dobson
models (it may be useful to look over how to <a
href="thrms/logistic.html">
decouple </a> the birth and death rates).   Below is a 
plot of a
model from the De
Leo and Dobson paper on on Allometry and
Simple Epidemic Models for Microparasites.
and here our some solutions to the variation explore above: the <a

<b> Week 9 :</b>
<p>
<p>

On Monday we took a look at some less <a
href="assignments/school.html"> vicious   </a> epidemics, that may
help you clear up some last minute issues arising in your final projects
(Due Wednesday).  I will hold extra office hours on Tuesday and Wednesday
day from 1:00-3:00.
<FONT COLOR="RED" FACE="Arial, Monoco">
Wednesday March 6 is the last day of class </font> 

<p> On Wednesday  day we will introduce the   <a
href="temps/VDP.html"> van der
Pole
</a> equation, whose phase portrait is displayed below.  Tomorrow there
is a 
Colloquium at 4:00 in 
102 Bradley Hall
on the 
"Mathematical Modeling of the Portion of the Brain that Governs Circadian
Rhythm" where Clyde Martin will use the van der Pol  equation in order to
explore  some interesting sounding biological phenomena.
