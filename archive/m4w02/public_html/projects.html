Group Projects </H1>
</CENTER>

The exploration of the ideas presented in the course will take the form 
 of group and individual projects.  Here is an <a
href="assignments/a2.html">
assignment </a>  where some fundamental
ideas from population dynamics like population growth and
various predator prey
relationships are explored and   applied to an assessment of the plight
of the <a

kakapo </a>. Here are a pair  the actual projects produced:  
<a
href="proj/atsaKAKAPO.htm">
project 1  </a>   (along with this project's maple code appendix in four
part<a
href="proj/tryagain/Equilibrium.html">
1 </a>,
<a
href="proj/tryagain/future.html">
2 </a>,
<a
href="proj/tryagain/Polynesians.html">
3 </a>,
<a
href="proj/tryagain/Europeans.html">
4 </a>, which can serve as an example of the type computational
tools that will learned during this course) and 
 <a href="proj/kakapo.html">
project 2 </a><b>  which needs to be viewed on Internet explorer </b> (or
you may see some serious viewing errors).  At the bottom of this page
you will find a graph from
this project indicating the types of variables and the complexity of the
systems that as students you will have the opportunity to  explore in
this course.
