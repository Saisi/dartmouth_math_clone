Change equation (e) form the De Leo and Dobson to fit each of the
following disease scenarios…
<p>   
1.  The fertility of all members of the population is unaffected by the
disease.  All members of the population contribute equally to the
consumption of resources.  The recovered are immune and pass their
immunity onto their offspring.   The exposed do not expose their offspring
to the disease.
<p>   
2.  Members of the population are unable to reproduce while infected, all
other members of the population have their reproductive ability unaffected
by the disease.  The infected are so ill that they use a negligible amount
of resources while infected, otherwise all other members of the population
contribute equally to the consumption of resources. The recovered are
immune and do not pass their immunity onto their offspring.  The exposed
will in fact expose their offspring to the disease. 
<p>   
3.  Members of the population are unable to reproduce while infected and
are left infertile but immune when recovered.  The recovered become immune
but this immunity is not passed onto any offspring. The infected are so
ill that they use a negligible amount of resources while infected,
otherwise all other members of the population contribute equally to the
consumption of resources. Exposure in itself does not affect fertility and
will not be passed onto any offspring.  
<p>   
For each of the above model the following variations: 
 <p>   
1.  The recovered are not completely immune but are less likely to catch
the disease than those whom never caught it.
 <p>   
2. The first generation of the immune will acquire the immunity, but the
second generation does not. 
<p>   
3.  The recovered are left significantly less active after the disease and
have a significant reduction in their consumption of resources after
having experienced this particular disease.
<p>   
4.  Suppose the disease only affects the male members of the population.
<p>
5.  Suppose the disease is more likely to affect the male members of the
population.
