<h2> Strange Pox </h2>
<hr>
<p>
Here we will attempt to see how to simplify our epidemic models in the
case of fast spreading non-lethal epidemics.  

<p>
1. Suppose you are the school nurse at Van Nuys High, a high schools with
3000 students,  and there has been a
small out break of Strange Pox.  So far there have only been 10 reported
cases and you are witnessing an increase of about 2 cases per day over
the last couple of  days.  You know from past experience that a case of
strange pox last about a week and that a student's residual anti bodies
will be strong enough to fend off a second bout with the disease for about
a month after recovery.  Model this epidemic as best as you can from this
data.

<p> 
2. After careful consideration you come to the conclusion that  half the
cases you are
witnessing are being faked in oder  to avoid going to class. 
Change your model assuming there is only  one actual new of
strange pox per day.  

<p>

3. How many   new cases of strange pox a day is what you might call 
the critical
"worry about this disease" level? 


<p>

4. Suppose there is a delay rate between exposure and infection of about a
week.  How does this affect your model.
