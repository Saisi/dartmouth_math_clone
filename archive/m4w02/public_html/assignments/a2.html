<h2>Group Assignment 1 </h2>
<hr>
<p>
This assignment will be due on  Friday  February first and is our
first group assignment.   

 <p>

For this assignment you are to imagine that your
group has been hired as consultants to a conservation organization.
Currently the organization is attempting  to save the <a
href="http://www.amnh.org/nationalcenter/Endangered/zealand/zealand.html">
kakapo </a>.   They have asked you develop mathematical
models in order to improve their understanding of how to handle the
kakapo's predicament as well as to help explain 
how the Kakapo arrived in its current predicamen, in order to help prevent
other species from experiencing a similar phenomena.  

 <p>

Your group's  report must contain the
following  technical components:
 


<p>
1.  Develop a (or several possible) differential equation(s) that attempts
to model the Kakapo
population  and its  environment before the arrival
of people and all that came with them. Describe the possible changes that
this model will undergo when various  human related human
related factors are introduced. 
Solve the equations you develop and describe what happens to the Kakapo
population.    Notice this will involve making many assumptions, clearly
most will be hypothetical but should be based on any information about
Kakapo that you are able to find.
 
<p>


2. Currently their are very few kakapo.  Attempt to find a differential
equation  which models he current kakapo situation and discuss any factors
which you feel  might make this a difficult endeavor (even if you
have lots of funding and data).   Some ideas about the issues involved in
modeling small population can be found in the articles at the end of
chapter 3.  

<p>

Once  these technical components are out of the way you
should attempt to articulate your findings in such a way that the
members of the conservation organization will be able 
to both understand and use them.
