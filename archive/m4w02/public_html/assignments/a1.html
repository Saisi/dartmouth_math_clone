<h2>Individual Assignment 1 </h2>
<hr>
<p>
This assignment will be due on Wednesday January  16th , and is based on
the Article on  HIV-1 Dynamics by Perelson et al on pages 15-22 of your
text. Warning:  this assignment includes some aspects that will require
tools that will be learned in the next few lectures, the most important of
which are the numerical techniques of solving the equations that naturally
arise. 

 <p>
1.  Equations 1-3 model a perfect drug.  Describe the sense in which the
modifications described in comment 9 (listed at the end of the
paper) change the model to that of an imperfect drug.  Choose some
reasonable parameters and numerically solve the imperfect
equation.  How does its solution compare will the perfect equation’s
solution?  How might you decide from the experimental data whether the
drug would be better modeled via an imperfect model?
<p>
2.  In the article it is assumed that T remains at approximately its
steadystate value.  To justify this assumption the authors quote [1] and
[5].  Look into [1] and [5] and determine how this assumption was actually
justified.  Devise and justify a model where T is allowed to vary and
attempt to numerically solve it.
<p>
3.  The authors claim that a model for drug treatment of viral load is
introduced in [2] where essentially the k in equation 1 and 2 is set to
zero (comment 11).  Look into [2] and describe how to justify this choice
of model.  Describe what is special about the drugs used to treat HIV that
requires the use of the model in this paper. Graph the model from [2] and
describe a relevant difference between the function V(t) that this model
describes and  the V(t) function described in the Perelson et al
paper. Describe how this difference is expressed in the authors’
conclusion.
