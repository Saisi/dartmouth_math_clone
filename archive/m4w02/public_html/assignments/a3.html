<h2>Individual Assignment 2 </h2>
<hr>
<p>
This assignment will be due on  Friday  February 22nd  and is
second individual assignment.  The assignment will be based on the
article about <IT> Allometry and Simple Epidemic Models for
Microparasites
</IT> by Leo and Dodson on pages 114-118 of our text. This assignment  
will be a way for me
to assess some of your basics skills: interpreting differential equation,
 parameter determination, researching a biological topic, and solving
differential equations.  This assignment will 
also serve  as a warm up to our final group project which will be based
upon  the modeling of an epidemic.  

<p>
1. Interpreting differential equations:   Look at the differential
equations  a-e in table 1.  Describe the assumptions about the
microparasites and the host population that each of these models
attempts to capture.  (All these models are different and it should be
clear in your description what these differences are.)  

<p>
2. Parameter determination: For at least one of the systems  a-e determine
how many of the parameters in the system  the Authors claim can
determined by the the host's  body mass and interpret 
any remaining parameters? (Hint: look carefully at figure 1 and its
caption.) 

<p>
3. Research:  On the second page of the article there is a claim that
"estimates of the basic host demography (nu,
mu and K) are available for many species.  Go out and find some!
<p>

4. Solving differential equations: For at least one of the systems  a-e
fix the parameters in a way consistent wit the description in the article
and look at the system's solution
graphically.   Exam any "interesting"  equilibrium values. Which
equilibria are stable? Is there any damped periodic behavior near the
equilibrium or not?
