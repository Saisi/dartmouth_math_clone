<h2>Final Group  Assignment </h2>
<hr>
<p>
This assignment will be due on  Wednesday March 6  and is the
final group assignment.   Due to our successful kakapo  modeling
our consulting firm has been commissioned to work on a new project, that of
assessing the current understanding of the
<a href="http://www.wehi.edu.au/MalDB-www/intro.html"> malaria </a>  
epidemic and making educated proposals about which direction humanity
should take regarding the strategies used to
control the spread of this very serious disease.  This is
particularly relevant at this time since several  methods of controlling
the epidemic are being explored by the scientific community (here is a
very  <a href="http://www.nature.com/nsu/020211/020211-11.html" >
recent  </a> example and here is a  "dynamic" exploration the method of
"sticky  <a href="http://www.wehi.edu.au/wehi-tv/movies/malaria.html">
bump  </a> control").  Your group  will need to carefully collect and
articulate the factors involved in the spread of malaria as well a  some
of the methods used (or proposed to be used) in order to control the
spread of malaria.   (There is a <b> vast </b> literature on this subject,
here is a  web based    <a  
href="http://www.malaria.org/learnaboutmalaria.html"> example  
</a>  complete with gobs of links, below is  a list of "references
through the ages".)  After collecting this information your group will
need to model the spread of malaria using differential equations  and then
assess how the proposed controls will affect the model.  In the end you
should attempt to conclude  how the proposed control strategies are likely
to affect the infected population and decide upon which strategies  look
the most promising (which should include commentary about issues such as a
strategy's 
cost and feasibility).
