In math 4 we will learn what a system of ordinary differential equations
is and gain an understanding  of  the  <a
href="thrms/theorem1.html">
fundamental
</a> results about how to solve and understand  such systems.
We will examine many interesting examples 
like the  Lokta-Volterra equations, linear systems of
equations, and a detailed look into some basic differential equations
like  the <a
href="thrms/logistic.html">
logistic </a>   equation.  Mathematical topics such as the 
stability analysis of equilibrium solutions and the basics bifurcation
theory  will be explored via graphical techniques such as <a
href="map.html">
simulation  </a>  and
phases plane analysis as well as by 
an exploration of some of the fundamental
mathematical results arising in these  theories, like the  <a
href="thrms/theorem2.html">
linearization </a> theorem, the <a
href="thrms/theorem3.html">
characterization 
</a> of linear systems, and the use of various linear algebra <a
href="thrms/theorem4.html">
tools </a> that arise in  this context (include some matrix algebra and
eigenvalue analysis).  Below  you see a phase
portrait related to the  Lokta-Volterra equations, equations that
arise when attempting model the relationship between predator and
prey.
