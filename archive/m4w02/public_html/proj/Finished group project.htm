makes it one of theworld’s 10 most prevalent and deadly diseases. 90% of Malaria cases occur insub-Saharan Africa.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is a parasiticdisease spread by the bite of an Anopheles mosquito which is active during theevening.&nbsp;&nbsp; Malarial symptoms can occur after 8 days following aninfected bite. The principal symptoms are fever, malaise, headache, chills andsweats but it can be present as a respiratory or gastrointestinal illness.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Children are especially<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>vulnerable to malaria. In Africa, where 80%of malaria cases are treated at home, the disease kills one child in twentybefore the age of five.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Malaria killsone child every 30 seconds. It is a death toll that far exceeds the mortalityrate from AIDS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Pregnant women are alsoat high risk. It causes severe anaemia, and is a major factor contributing tomaternal deaths in malaria endemic regions. Pregnant mothers who have malariaand are HIV-positive are more likely to pass on their HIV status to theirunborn child.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There is a fourfoldincrease in risk of disease and a two-fold increase in death rates.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In many African countries about 20-30% ofdoctor's visits are for malaria as well as 10% of hospital admissions.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Unfortunately, Mosquitoes are developingresistance to the major classes of insecticide which have been used to controlthe disease.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>People are most at risk ofmalaria during the warm and rainy seasons since most of the farm work needs tobe done at this time.</p><p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The malaria pathogen is not abacterium or a virus. It is a unicellular parasite.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>There are four different species of the malaria parasite. Two aremost common. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Plasmodium falciparum</i>,which is found globally but is commonest in Africa, is the most aggressivespecies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Infection of this type killsapproximately 1-2% of those who come down with it. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Falciparum</i> malaria is a serious illness characterized by fever,headache, and weakness. It often kills through coma or anemia.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Plasmodiumvivax</i>, which ranges widely throughout Asia, Africa, the Middle East,Oceania and the Americas (and is resurgent in Eastern Europe), can causerecurring and debilitating infection, but rarely kills.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The other two forms are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Plasmodium ovale</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Plasmodiummalariae</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p><p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The life cycle of malaria(plasmodia) is complex. The infective stage occurs when sporozoites areinjected from the salivary glands of infected mosquitoes into a host.Sporozoites disappear from the blood within 30 minutes. Some are destroyed bywhite blood cells, but many enter liver cells very quickly.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sporozoites that enter liver cellsdifferentiate into hypnozoites that can remain dormant for weeks, months, oreven years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Exoerythrocytic Phaseoccurs when sporozoites enter liver cells and multiply asexually.

Supposedly superior drugs to quininewere produced and the parasites have become resistant in a short space of time,but quinine resistance had only very recently developed in limited geographicareas. Quinine is again the drug of choice for treatment of severe falciparummalaria, and is also widely used in uncomplicated falciparum malaria. The recommendedadult dose is 600 mg (that is two tablets) three times a day for seven days,(=42 tablets in total). Side-effects include blurred vision, nausea, transienthigh tone deafness and rarely severe thrombocytopenia </p><p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> </span>As a drug for treating the established disease in a patient,Chloroquine is still effective for benign malarias world-wide and evenfalciparum malaria in restricted areas where resistant parasites are not founde.g. Dominican Republic and parts of the Middle East. The recommended adult doseby the World Health Organization is 600mg (base) on the first and second daysof treatment, and 300mg (base) on the third day of treatment.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The third treatment Mefloquine, is alsoknown as 'Lariam'. The great advantage of lariam is that it can be given in asingle dose of either 1000mg or 15mg / kg of body weight whichever is lower. OnThailand borders, however, the adult dose is 1000mg initially followed by 500mg6-8 hours later. Resistance to the drug has also developed.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p><p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Another category of drugs is thetetracycline, an antibiotic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    </span>Thesedrugs have proved to be a useful addition to quinine especially in areas whereresistance to quinine is emerging. The drugs are blood shizontocides.Doxycycline is considered to be an effective drug for multiresistant falciparummalaria, and is used especially in areas where mefloquine resistance is nowcommon, for example Thailand. The recommended adult dose is 100mg a day, but inpatients with severe falciparum malaria treatment should not be started untiltheir renal function has returned to normal. These drugs should not be used inpregnant or lactating women, or in young children because they can havedamaging effects on the development of bones and teeth. Therefore tetracyclinesare useful drugs but use should be limited in areas where resistance woulddevelop, until it is really necessary, or the same scenario would be seen ashappened with mefloquine. </p><p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The newest and most effective drugthus far is Malarone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Studies haveshown in that in Sub-Saharan Africa, there is a 95-100% efficacy in malariatreatment with Malarone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Malarone workson two parts of the parasitic lifecycle, both the production of red blood cellsand the incubation of parasites in the liver.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Thus, by killing of new red blood cells, spread of disease in thesociety can be prevented because other mosquitoes cannot bite and carryinfection to a new host.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus, bykilling both the source (liver), and the newly produced parasitic red bloodcells, Malarone prevents the spread of malaria inside and outside of the body. </p><p style='text-indent:.5in'>Recommended doses for Malarone vary depending onage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p><p style='text-indent:.5in'>1 adult tablet daily (250&nbsp;mg atovaquone/100&nbsp;mg proguanil)</p><p style='text-indent:.5in'>11-20&nbsp;kg: 1 pediatric tablet* daily</p><p style='text-indent:.5in'>21-30&nbsp;kg: 2 pediatric tablets daily</p><p style='text-indent:.5in'>31-40&nbsp;kg: 3 pediatric tablets daily</p><p style='text-indent:.5in'>&gt;40&nbsp;kg: 1 adult tablet daily</p><p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Contraindicated in infants&lt;11&nbsp;kg. Pregnant women or women breast-feeding infants weighing lessthan 11&nbsp;kg should not use Malarone to prevent malaria. Contraindicated inpatients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30&nbsp;ml/min).</p><p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&quot;While waiting for new drugswith novel mechanisms of action to be discovered, developed and hopefullydeployed, appropriate measures should be taken to safeguard the few compoundsavailable to us.&quot; (N. White, 1996) </p><p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>By using combination chemotherapyit is possible to delay the onset of resistance. &quot;If the antimalarialresistance mechanisms are not linked, then the chances of a resistant mutantarising in any parasite life cycle are the product of the individual chancesfor each drug administered. The drugs used in combination should havecompatible pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, no adverse pharmacologicalinteraction and no additional toxicity.&quot; (N. White, 1996) </p><p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There are several examples of drugcombinations to treat malaria. 'Metakelfin' is a combination of pyrimethaminewith sulfamethoxypyrazine which is used to treat drug resistant malaria.'Fansidar' is a combination of pyrimethamine with sulfadoxine and was oncevaluable to treat chloroquine resistant falciparum parasites, but resistancehas emerged. 'Maloprim' or 'Deltaprim' is a combination of pyrimethamine withdapsone and is used as a prophylactic against resistant malarial parasites. TheChinese drug pyronaridine has occasionally been given with pyrimethamine andsulfanamide. Recent attempts for combined chemotherapy are artemisininderivatives combined with mefloquine, which is currently being used inSoutheast Asia and a fixed combination of atovaquone and proguanil which is inadvanced stages of clinical development. </p><p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The chances of a drug resistantmutant appearing are reduced considerably when combination chemotherapy isused. This is of great importance with new drugs being used, as it is desirableto maintain their efficacy against the multi-resistant falciparum parasite foras long as possible. </p><p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Combination chemotherapy is arational approach to the containment of drug resistance in malaria, ascombination therapy can provide significant improvement in the treatment ofmild malaria than monotherapy. </p><p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Resistance is a very seriousproblem in the fight to eradicate malaria. The falciparum parasite isdeveloping resistance to whatever drug is used against it, the only possibleexception are the artemisinin derivatives. Even resistance to quinine hasdeveloped in Thailand. It is not only the anti-malarial drugs that haveencountered problems with resistance, the mosquito has developed resistance tomany of the insecticides that have been used to try to eradicate it. The mostfamous of these insecticides is DDT. </p><p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Development of new drugs andinsecticides is a very costly process, both in time and money. It takes a longtime to develop a new drug that would be effective, and then it has to gothrough various tests and trials to prove it is safe for use in humans and veryfew will ever make it to the stage of being approved for use as ananti-malarial drug. The same is true for the development of a vaccine. </p><p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The greatest problem withdeveloping resistance in the falciparum parasite is that if the use of thedrugs had been monitored carefully the resistance would not have developed soquickly. If a drug e.g. chloroquine was administered in doses not high enoughto destroy the infection, there is a selective pressure for the parasites todevelop resistance to the drug. This happened when a government decided to mixchloroquine with an ingredient for cooking e.g. salt of flour etc. The dose wasnot high enough to eliminate the parasite. Drugs with long half-lives exertgreater selection pressure to develop resistance as the drug will last a longtime in the body at levels which will not destroy the parasite (subtherapeuticlevels). </p><p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There is a possibility thatchloroquine resistance may be reversed by using calcium channel blockers, whichprevent the drug from being pumped out of the cell before having any toxiceffect on the parasite. If studies prove that they are effective, it will be agreat breakthrough in the fight against the parasites, and chloroquine mayagain be used to treat malaria all over the world. </p><p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Combination chemotherapy will helpa great deal in slowing down the development of resistance, and the developmentof new drugs will structures that are not similar to the drugs that thefalciparum parasite is resistant will help prevent cross resistance. </p><p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There are drugs which may be ableto reverse chloroquine resistance, to prevent the parasite from pumping thedrug back out of the cell so it doesn't become concentrated in the parasitescytoplasm. These drugs are calcium channel blockers e.g. verapamil andnifedipene. If these were proved to be effective in reversing chloroquineresistance in humans it would be a very important discovery, and a very populardrug would again be able to be used effectively around the world. This woulddecrease the need for new antimalarial drugs to be produced, but this would notmean for research to stop. There is still a need for new effective drugsagainst multi-resistant falciparum parasites in case the calcium channelblockers are not as effective as hoped, or the parasite develops ways forcombating their action too.</p><p style='line-height:200%'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>PartialImmunity:<o:p></o:p></u></b></p><p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>A person’s risk of becominginfected with malaria or of showing extreme symptoms of malaria can besignificantly reduced for two reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The first is if a person has Sickle Cell Anemia, a group of inheritedred blood cell disorders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A normal redblood cell has the appearance of a doughnut and it delivers oxygen to the bodyvia small round blood tubes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Inside anormal blood cell is a substance called hemoglobin whose function is to carryoxygen inside the walls of the cell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>However, one microscopic change in the hemoglobin causes it to form long“rods” inside the cell when it gives away oxygen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>When these long, pointed, hard red blood cells try to passthrough the narrow, round blood tubes, they clog the flow of the tube and breakapart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This often causes damage, pain,and a low blood count, also known as anemia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sickle cellanemia, like malaria, cannot be caught and is not contagious.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Unlike malaria however, a person is bornwith this disease because the alleles for sickle cells have been passed downfrom the parents to a newborn baby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Dueto the way genetics plays out, a child will only show symptoms of sickle cellif <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>both</i> parents pass on the allelefor this disease.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If only one parentpasses on the allele, the child will carry the sickle cell trait (and possiblypass the allele onto his or her offspring), but the child will not have thesymptoms of the disease.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><br><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">            </span>The importance of sicklecell anemia in this discussion of the malaria epidemic is that it has beenproven that individuals with sickle cell anemia appear to have a distinctadvantage over individuals with normal hemoglobin alleles.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, this advantage seems only to beeffective in the case of Plasmodium falciparum malaria.<spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The way this advantage functions is thatwhen a red blood cell containing P. falciparum undergoes the sickling process,it is destroyed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Other researcherssuggest that the infected red blood cell first sickles and is then destroyedsomewhere in the vascular system, liver, or spleen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Yet whatever way this occurs, the important result is thatmalarial infection only exists for a short period of time and the incidences ofcerebral malaria and subsequent death is quite low.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Therefore, although a person with sickle cell anemia is not <istyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>completely</i> immune to malaria, his or herchances of contracting or developing severe symptoms of the disease aresignificantly lower.</p><p><b
