<h2>Math 4 (Calculus with applications to biology) - Winter  2002</h2>

<p>
<b> Text: </b> <IT> Modeling Differential Equations in
Biology by Clifford Henry Taubs (Princeton hall, 2001).

<b>Grade</b>: Your grade will be determined as follows: 2 written  
individual
assignments,  worth a total of 20% of your grade, and
two group projects the first worth 35% of your grade and the second 45%
of your grade.  
<p>
<b>Assignments:</b>  Assignment will come in two forms reading assignments
and the above mentioned written assignments. The assignments can be
found in the weekly <a href="hw.html"> log.</a> Here is
an example of a written <a href="assignments/a1.html"> assignment
</a>.  While working on an assignment you  may use any
references  you'd like  under the condition that you  always  carefully
reference your
sources.  With regard to the individual assignments, collaboration is
encouraged during the process of thinking about the assignments, but
every non-referenced aspect of your  
final write up  must be entirely in your own words. 

<p>
<b>Students with disabilities</b>:  I encourage students with
disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases
and learning disabilities, to discuss  with me any
appropriate accommodations that might be helpful.
