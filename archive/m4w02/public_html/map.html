Here is some help regarding down loading maple 7 to a 
<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/software/maple7-mac.html"> Mac </a>
and here is some help for loading it onto a 
<a

Our  <a
href="temps/t1.html"> first  </a>
template can be used to solve a first order differential equation with one
dependent and one independent variable.  In this case we are solving 
<center>
dy/dt=-y^2+5sin(t)
</center>
subject to the initial data that at time .2 y's value is 5. 
<p>
<hr>  
<a
href="temps/exp.html"> Here   </a> is
an example of using this template to explore the standard
exponential function ant it relation to 
<ceneter>
dY/dt=Y
</center>
giving us a nice use of differential equations to approximate the constant
e.

Here is an example were we <a
href="temps/Explore.html"> explore
</a> some possible parameter changes when
modeling fish populations.

Our  <a
href="temps/t2.html"> second  </a>
template can be used to solve a first order system of differential
equations.

<p>
<hr>  

Here is our initial use of the <a
href="temps/Logistic.html">
logistic 
</a> equation in order to model a fish population.  Here  we make the
model more accurate wit ha <a
href="temps/LogSin.html">
periodic 
</a> periodic birth rate. Here is
model we develop for a
fish population that was
experiencing the effects of  <a
href="temps/Polution.html"> pollution
</a>
(as well as a seasonally determined birth rate).

Here is the  <a
href="temps/FisherFolk.html"> 
Lokta-Volterra </a> type model of our fish and fisher folk
and here is the  <a
href="temps/Alligators.html">
alligator </a> model. 
Here are the three models for a "ecosystem" involving fish, alligators and
fisher-folk that you developed in class <a
href="temps/JPAK.html"> JPAK
</a>,<a
href="temps/STA.html"> STA
</a>,and <a

</a>.

Here is how to make a <a

the context of our Lokta-Volterra model

At this point we are making a detailed exploration of the equation 
<center>
dx/dt=x(1-x)-axy 
<p>
dy/dt=-y+axy
</center>
<p>
Part of or motivation is as we vary the parameter a from 1.1 to  2 we see
a <a
href="temps/FinalBif.html">
bifurcation
</a>, in other words  a qualitative change in the systems behavior.  In
order to
understand this we <a
href="temps/ZommIn.html"> zoom
</a> into the equilibrium and notice that near its equilibrium point the
solution to this equation really does behave like those of the equation's 
<a
href="temps/LinSysX.html">
linearization
</a>.  Fortunately (up to to a wiggle)  we can determine the 
qualitative properties of the solution from its linearization,
and in <a
href="temps/ZoomIt.html">
this 
</a> program we see how to take a system along with a known equilibrium
point and find its linearization and explore this linear systems
eigenvalues.  Recall the linear system's 
eigenvalues allow us to 
determine the original system's  qualitative properties near the equilibrium
point by comparing it to a  <a
href="temps/LinearSys.html"> standard 
</a> linear model.

Here is a simulation of the  final <a
href="temps/SmallEpidemic.html">
epidemic 
</a> model form the De Leo and Dobson paper. Here are the simulations of
the
variations to the model that we discussed in lecture  <a
href="temps/Article.html">
article
</a>, <a
href="temps/Model1.html">
variation 1
</a>, <a
href="temps/Model2.html">
variation 2
</a>, and  <a
href="temps/Model3.html">
variation 3
</a> (for a couple of different parameter choices).
Here is a simulation for the fast moving  <a
href="temps/SmallEp.html">
non-lethal 
</a> 
epidemics as discussed
in class.

Here  we explore the  damped <a
href="temps/HarmonicO.html">
oscillator 
</a> and 
here  see what happen as we over damp the system with  as we vary the <a
href="temps/HarPar.html"> friction 
</a>.
Here  we explore the  <a
href="temps/VDP.html"> van der
Pol 
</a> equation.
Here  see the meaning of a relaxation oscillation  as we <a
href="temps/VanPar.html"> vary
</a> an interesting parameter in the van der Pol equation.
