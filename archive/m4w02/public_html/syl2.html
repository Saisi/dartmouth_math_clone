<H1>Applications of Calculus to Medicine and Biology  (<a
href="index.html"> Math 4 </a>)
Syllabus</H1>
</CENTER>


 This course will establish the relevance of calculus to medicine and
biology. In it we   will develop various mathematical tools extending the
techniques of introductory calculus with a particular emphasis on the on
<a
href="tech.html">
tools  </a>  needed for
solving  and understanding ordinary  differential equations.  
These tools will be used to construct and explore simple and elegant
models of variety of biological phenomena including the spread of an
epidemic  and the growth of a population.  This 
exploration will include the examination of articles found in
the current biology research literature and  ample computer
<a
href="map.html"> simulations  </a> of the models that we run into.  
At the heart of this course will
be your <b> <a href="projects.html"> own  </a> </b> exploration
of the  concepts and tools introduced.   

<p> 
Below we see the  simulation of a
model describing an epidemic that arose in the paper Allometry and Simple
Epidemic Models for Microparasites by G. A. De Leo and A. P. Dodson that
was   <a

</a>  in this
course.
