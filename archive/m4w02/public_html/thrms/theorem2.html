The Linearization  Theorem  </H1>
</CENTER>


This goal of the following is to give us a practical feel in order to
use the linearization theorem.   For now let us think a bout a system of
two equations and the system's  phase portrait.  Usually if we zoom into a
point on the phase plane we see nothing but a bunch of parallel straight
lines.  The phase portrait only become locally interesting looking near an
equilibrium point.  It is useful to understand what we see as we zoom
into an equilibrium point.  The wonderful fact is that we can
mathematically zoom into the equilibrium point and as we've seen this can
be accomplished by looking at the equations linearization at the
equilibrium point. In
practice we can accomplish this by running the <a
href="../temps/ZoomIt.html">
ZoomIn
</a> program, which will take a system of equation and a specified
equilibrium point and produce its linearization and evaluates the
linear system's determinant. We have the following
theorem: 


<p>
<b> The Linearization Theorem :</b>
Take a system of equations and linearize it at an equilibrium point.
If the determinant of the linear system  is non-zero then as we zoom into
the equilibrium point we see very nearly the same solutions as we see
when zooming into the origin of the linear system.

In practical terms the linear system acts like a magnifying glass
allowing us to readily see what solutions behave like near an equilibrium
point. Its nice to see this theorem in action by <a
href="../temps/ZommIn.html"> zooming
</a> into the equilibrium point of a system and its associated
linearization  and comparing what we see.  The sequence of pictures in
this program is doing precisely that.  As another <a
href="../temps/LinSysX.html"> example
</a> we can zoom into
the equilibrium point (1/a,1/a-1/a^2) of 
the system 
dx/dt=x(1-x)-axy and 
dy/dt=-y+axy
when the parameter a is set to 1.1 and when  a is set to 2.
