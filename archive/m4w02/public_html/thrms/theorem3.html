The  Big Theorem
</H1>
</CENTER>


This goal of the following is to give us a practical feel 
for our big theorem.  In practice this theorem is at the heart of how we
can  qualitatively the behavior of a system near and equilibrium point. 
In order to state it we need to recall that a <b> wiggle </b> of a linear
system is
a small change in the constants that arise when describing the system.
The big theorem is...

<p>
<b> The Big Theorem:</b>
After an arbitrarily small wiggle, every linear system is
<b> qualitatively </b> equivalent to one in which the variables decouple
into a collection of exponential pieces in the form dx/dt= lambda x  and
pairs
in the form  dx/dt= lambda x - omega y, dy/dt = omega x + lambda y.
<p>


The nicest  part of the big theorem  theorem is that if you understand
what happens in the  two by two case then you essentially understand
all the other cases as well. Recall in these two by two cases we
 explicitly  solved these 2 by 2 systems and explored their <a

portraits </a>.  


<p> 

The constants showing up in the Big Theorem
had for us a very
special significance and were even given a name,  the set of
<b> eigenvalues </b>.  More
precisely  each exponential  piece contributed its associated lambda to the
system's list of  eigenvalues while each pair in the form
dx/dt= lambda
x
- omega y, dy/dt = omega x + lambda y contributed a lambda+ omega I and
a lambda - omega I to the
system's eigenvalues.  Fortunately we can find these eigenvalues with the
the
