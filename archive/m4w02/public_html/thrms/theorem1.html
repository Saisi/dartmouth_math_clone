The Fundamental Theorem  </H1>
</CENTER>

This result will be at the very heart of this course.  It tells us that
the method we are using to approximate a solution to a system of
differential equations on maple really works!
Recall the method was simply a careful  articulation of
what a differential equation tells us, namely if we know what time
it is and where we are then the equation tells us (approximately) where
we will be after a small increment of time (the Deltat in the program).
To see this method in action look at any of our maple  <a
href="../map.html"> templates  </a>
In the
statement of the theorem
we use the terms mean T,T_0,I_0 and N to mean exactly what they
meant  in these programs and in lecture lecture, namely T_0 is the
initial time, T is the final time, I0 is the initial position, and
N is the number of increments that T-T_0 has been divided into.

<p>
<b> The Fundamental Theorem :</b>
Given a system of differential equations
d <b> x </b> /dt = <b> f </b> (<b> x </b> ,t)
if the components  of <b> f </b>  have continuous derivatives
everywhere then then for any fixed T > T0 and I0 as N goes to infinity  
our approximation tends  to the unique solution of this system with
<b> f </b>(T0)=I0 </b>.

<p>
Its nice to see this, and in particular the $N$ dependency, in
action.  In this 
<a
href="../temps/t1.html"> example 
</a>  we see a sequence of approximation to a solution of  
dy/dt=-y^2+5sin(t) converging to an actual solution as N increases.

A careful reading of this theorem reveals three things:
<p>

1.That such a system of equations always has a solution for any initial
data. This is often referred to as an existence result.

<p>

2. That such a system  has a unique solution. This is often called a
uniqueness result.

<p>

3. That our method tends to the actual solution, in other words that
we can "trust" the numbers and graphs produced by
maple. In order to estimate how big $N$ really needs
to be is one of
the topics  covered during  a course on "numerical methods".
