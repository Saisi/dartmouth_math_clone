<H1> Finding and 
Using the Eigenvalues  </H1>
</CENTER>

Here is our detection theorem, stated  in an
hilariously practical
form!
<p>
<b> The Detection  Theorem:</b>  
The eigenvalues can
be detected by plugging the matrix describing the system into the 
<a
href="../temps/ZoomIt.html">
Detect
</a> program.  
<p>

<p> 
Recall that  key to the eigenvalues is that they help  us determine some
of the system's qualitative properties near an equilibrium point. 
The most important qualitative property that these eigenvalues
allow us to  determine is  whether an equilibrium point  is stable or
not. Namely we found the the system is
stable if and only if all the lambda are negative.  Another quality
that the eigenvalues let
us determine  is whether or not  any oscillating behavior occurs  near
the system's equilibrium point.  This property is detected by
the presence of  a complex  number in the list of eigenvalues. 
   

<p>
<b> Warning</b>: As we have discussed one should be careful about
 qualitative claims  especially if  a wiggle was required in when
applying the  <a
href="theorem3.html">
Big Theorem
</a>.  This corresponds to the case when their is a
repeat or a zero in the list of lambdas. The wiggled solution is then near
a <b> bifurcation </b>, in other words a system whose 
qualitative properties will  change after after an arbitrarily small
wiggle.    For example with regards
to the equations  dx/dt=x(1-x)-axy and 
dy/dt=-y+axy we saw that as our parameter a varied from  from 1.1 to  2
that the equation
experienced  a <a
href="../temps/FinalBif.html">
bifurcation
</a>.  It is a bit difficult to see this from the animation,  however
at the two 
extreme  a values (a=1.1 and a=2) we  can <a
href="../temps/LinSysX.html">
zoom
</a> in  and can clearly see that a bifurcation must occur. After
exploring these
equations in detail we found that a  bifurcation took place when the
parameter a was
about equal to 1.207
and that any a near this value will be close to a bifurcation.  We gave
these types of observations a name... 


<p>
<b> The Wiggle Test:</b>    
If there is a zero or repeat in the lambda values then you need to
perform a wiggle, and   if there is <b> nearly
</b> a zero or a repeated lambda
value then you are near a bifurcation - and you should mention it!
