Weber</font></center>

<p>Welcome to Math 12!  This page will be updated regularly (I hope) and
provide information to help you keep track of the course.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/hw.html">Homework assignments</a> will be posted online so you
have the list all together.</p>

<p><font color="darkblue"><b>Announcements</b></font></p>

<p>There will be a <font color="darkblue">review session</font> Friday 2-5
pm in Bradley 104.  I will hold additional office hours this week,
Thursday 1-3 pm, and you are also welcome to make appointments.  Other
than midafternoon Tuesday and (possibly) late afternoon Thursday I am
flexible in meeting times.</p>

<p>Our <font color="darkblue">final exam</font> will be held 8:00 AM,
Saturday March 11, in our classroom Bradley 104.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/hw.html">homework list</a> is now complete.</p>

<!--<p>Extra Credit Problems:<br>
Due Friday the 17th: Write up the proof that the integral over C of Q dy
equals the double integral over D of dQ/dx dA, where C is the boundary of
the simple region D (the other half of the proof of Green's Theorem on
page 1120-1121).<br>
Due Wednesday, February 22: Exercise #37 on page 1133.  Write it up 
clearly for credit.</p>

<p>I've posted a page which explains <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/roadmap.pdf">where we're
going</a> after the second midterm, just a single-page pdf file.</p>-->

<p>The day-by-day schedule, for the time remaining:
<table>
<tr><td>3/9</td><td>office hours 1-3 pm</td></tr>
<tr><td>3/10</td><td>review session 2-5 pm, Bradley 104</td></tr>
<tr><td>3/11</td><td>exam, 8 am, Bradley 104</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>I'm hoping to have the exams graded by the end of the weekend, but 
certainly will by the end of Monday.  I'll be leaving town the morning of 
Wednesday the 15th, but if you'd like to talk about the exam on Tuesday I 
will make time to be in the department that afternoon.</p>

I found a picture of two planes intersecting, with their normal vectors.  
It's not precisely what I was hoping for but it's something.</p>-->

<p><b>General information</b>, reprinted from the syllabus:<br> My office
is in 412 Bradley Hall, phone number 646-1720.  However, it's better to <a
href="mailto:rweber@math.dartmouth.edu">e-mail me</a> to get in touch,
since as of this writing I still don't have access to my voice mail.  You
can also Blitz, I check both that and my math department e-mail
regularly.</p>

<p>Office hours will be any unused X-hour, plus 4-5 PM Tuesdays.  They
will be held in my office, Bradley 412.  Appointments are also welcome if
the scheduled hours don't work out for you some week.  The course meets in
the 11 hour, 11:15-12:20 MWF, in Bradley 104.  Our X-hour is Tuesday
12:00-12:50, and we will use it occasionally.</p>

<p>The textbook, available in the bookstore, is the fifth edition of James
Stewart's <em>Calculus</em>, which has a black cover with a close-up of a
violin on the front.  We will cover most of the sections in chapters 
13-17, but in a <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/order.html">different order</a> from that of 
the book.</p>

<p>The <b>calendar</b>, in all its irregularity:
<table>
<tr><td>January 4 (W):</td> <td>First day of classes</td></tr>
