<p>

We apply the tools of calculus to the study of functions of several variables, and functions mapping from and to two- and three- (and more-) dimensional space.  These functions are important in many applications, from physics to economics.

<p>  

Our main interest will be in the mathematical theory of these functions, and occasionally in the physics that inspired this theory.  We will begin learning to write proofs as well as solve problems.
<p> Prerequisite for this course:  Math 8 or the equivalent.  If you are not sure about your preparation for an honors course, please see Professor Groszek.<p>Math 14 is the honors version of Math 13, and can substitute for Math 13 as a prerequisite for any course, major, or minor.

The TA for this class is Michael Wijaya.  

<p>

Evening tutorials for this class will be held every Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday evening from 7:00 to 8:00 in 28 Haldeman.  The TA will stay later than 8:00 if there are students who arrived at tutorial by 7:30 and still have questions.

There will be two midterm exams and one final.  The midterm exams are scheduled for 4-6 PM on Wednesday, January 28, and Wednesday, February 18.  Both midterm exams will be in Wilder 111.  The final exam is scheduled by the registrar for 11:30 AM on March 13, in a room still to be announced.

<p>

There will also be occasional in-class quizzes, on routine computational techniques.  Missed quizzes receive a grade of zero.  The lowest quiz grade will be dropped.

Unexcused late homework will receive no credit.  Late homework will be excused only in case of serious illness or similar situation.  The lowest two homework grades will be dropped.

<p>

Special homework will be assigned weekly, on Monday, and is due at the beginning of class the next Monday.  These proofs will be graded on a credit or no credit basis, except that those turned in late will receive partial credit.  Proofs receiving no credit can be rewritten for full credit, as many times as necessary.
 <p>

 <br><!-- Grades Separator --> <table bgcolor=#7397b0 border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2width=100%> <th align=left><a name="grades"></a>Grades</th> </table> <p><!-- Information --> Your course grade will be computed out of 500 points, as follows:  200 points for the final exam, 100 points for each midterm, and 100 points for a combination of homework, quizzes, and class participation. 

<p>

Class participation will be graded each day as credit or no credit.  To receive credit, you need only be present, do your best to respond if asked a question, and occasionally work together in small groups as directed.  Credit does not depend on volunteering to speak, or on whether your answers are correct.  Up to three grades of no credit will be dropped.<p> <br><!-- Honor Principle separator --> <table bgcolor=#7397b0 border=0 cellpadding=2cellspacing=2 width=100%> <th align=left><a name="honor"></a>The Honor Principle</th> </table> <p><!-- Honor Principle details -->Academic integrity and intellectual honesty are an integral part of academic practice.  This does not mean thatyou can't work on homework together or get ideas and help from other people.  It does mean that you can'tpresent somebody else's work or ideas without giving them due credit.<p> Feel free to discuss homework problems with other people and to work together to answer them.  You mustwrite up the answers yourself without copying from anybody.  (This means you cannot copy down a joint solutionarrived at by a group working together, even if you were part of the group.  You must write up the solution inyour own words.)  You must also acknowledge any sources your consulted or people you worked with.  Working withother people or consulting other sources will not lower your grade.<p> Of course, no help may be given or received on exams.  <p> <br><!-- Disabilities separator --> <table bgcolor=#7397b0 border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2width=100%> <th align=left><A NAME="disabilities"></a>Disabilities</th> </table> <p><!-- Disabilities statement --> Students with disabilities who will be taking this course and may needdisability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an appointment to see the instructor as soonas possible.
