2003</h2><p><b> Text: </b> <IT> General Statistics </IT>  by W. Chase 
and F. Brown   (John Wiley and Sons 2000).</IT><p>  <b>Grade</b>: Your 
grade will be determined as follows: a midterm exam  (20% of your grade),  
a short project  (20% of your grade), quizzes (20% of your grade),  and a 
final exam (the remaining  40% of your grade).  <p><b>Class Log:</b>   
The homework assignments and exam  dates   can be found in the 
class <a href="hw.html"> log.</a>  Wednesday's class will often  
include a quiz 
based VERY closely on the assigned homework martial.<p><b>Honor 
Principle</b>: 
On the exams and quizzes, no help is to be given or received.
While working on the short project you may use any references you'd like under the condition that you always carefully reference your sources. Also,collaboration is encouraged during the process of thinking about and collecting data for your project, but every non-referenced aspect of your final write up must be entirely in your own words. <p><b>Students with disabilities</b>:  I encourage students withdisabilities, including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases and learning disabilities, to discuss  with me anyappropriate accommodations that 
might be helpful.<p>

<b>X-Session</b>: We will usually be using  the  X-Session  
as a place  where  you can  receive advice on 
how to think about and solve the assigned problems.    
<p>

<b>Syllabus</b>: In this course we will cover the three basic tools of the 
statistical trade: 
descriptive statistics, probability, and inference. First  we will cover  various topics in descriptive statistics, including a look at correlation and the regression line.  Next we will familiarize ourselves with various   probability ideas, including the understanding of discrete distributions and the central limit theorem.  Lastly, we  will put our first two topics together 
and discuss inferential statistics, including a discussion of 
confidence intervals and a variety of hypothesis tests.
