Probability
</a> and the <a href="facts/3FMP.html"> Third   Fundamental Mystery of
Probability

href="Sampling.pdf">see </a>  why we need 
the ``n-1" in the denominator of the sample variance.  <b> Note : </b>  
this ``n-1" discussion 
discussion is not for the faint of heart, and will <b> never </b>  show up 
on an 
exam, but I think its kind of fun fun to see!)

<p>
Your mini-project is to think of a hypothesis that you might 
want to test and then:  1.  state the purpose of your test, 2. set up 
a pretest and articulate how you came to this pre-test's formulation, 3. 
run your  pre-test, 4 analyze your results, 5 describe any difference you 
would  implement in performing a second pretest. 
Here is an example of an acceptable mini project, <A  HREF="example.pdf"> 
Coke/Pepsi </A>. (Due to the visible haste in writing this up, this 
project would be lucky to receive a B+ and would probably receive a B, so 
think  of it as a template for an acceptable, though not great, 
mini-project.)  By the way, you may work in groups to formulate   your 
pretest and collect your data.  The write up and analysis needs to be your 
own.

<b> Week 8 (May 12-May 16) :</b>
There will be quiz on  Wednesday  May  21th
based on the definitions and ODD numbered questions found in sections

<b> Week 9 (May 19-May 23) :</b>
There is no quiz on May  28th, our last day of class.  
However you still  have an assignment.  
Namely, do the ODD numbered questions found in sections
 11.2 and , 11.3.  Your final exam will definitely include  a problem 
from each of these section (and also will  definitely include a 
problem from each of the sections   8.2, 8.3 and 10.2). 
<hr>
<b> Week 10 (May 28 and June 1) :</b>
There will be an optional math 10 review session
Tu 1:00-1:50 in  Bradley  102.  
Your mini project is due by May 28th at class time. The <b>Final Exam</b> 
will  be held in out usual room on 
Sunday June 1  from 1:30-3:30 P.M. 
 As with our first exam, the final will have two parts.  Part 1 
will consist of 10 problems that are very similar to book exercises.  
8 of which will be selected from the sections covered in chapters 7-11, and 
2 of which will come from the sections covered in chapters 4-6.
In  Part 2  you will be tested on your understanding of  the various 
experiments run in class. More precisely, Part 2 will consist 
of 4 mini-worksheets, each based on  one  the following experiments: 
our ESP  experiment, our  loaded dice  experiment, our Coke-Pepsi  
challenge, our  graham cracker  experiment,  our computer name bias 
experiment, our MandM  experiment,  the class midterm correlation  
discussion (including our  normality test), 
and our  independence test  (this will 
be  performed on the last day  of  class).
