Homework due February 1:
<p>
(1) Show that the number of integers n in [1,x] divisible by
a square > log n is O(x/(log x)^{1/2}).
<br>
<br>
(2) Let S be a set of primes with an infinite reciprocal sum.
Show that the set of integers not divisible by any member of S
has asymptotic density 0.  
<br> (That is, show that the number of n in [1,x], with n not
divisible by any member of S, is o(x).)
<br>
<br>
(3) Show that the set of integers which are expressible as the
sum of 2 squares has asymptotic density 0.  
<br>
(You might first do this for numbers that are the sum of 2 coprime
squares.)
<br><br>
(4) Given an arbitrary positive integer k, show that the set
of integers n with phi(n) divisible by k has asymptotic density 1.
</p>
<p>
Homework due Tuesday, January 24:<br>
<br>
(1) Prove the assertion in Davenport that the Euler-Mascheroni
constant is equal to the negative of the integral of (log u)/e^u
for u running from 0 to infinity.
<br>
<br>
(2) Justify the interchange of integration and summation on the
center of page 61 of Davenport.
<br><br>
(3) Numbers 12 and 11 from Chapter 2 of the Montgomery-Vaughan book.
You might try the first part of 12 by using partial summation and
the result from class about phi(n)/n.
</p>
<p>
Homework due Tuesday, January 18: <br>
<br>
(1) Using only first principles (that is, without citing Stirling's
formula), prove that <br>
log(n!) = n log n - n +O(log n). <br>
<br>
(2) Assuming that the sum of (log p)/p for primes p up to x is
log x +O(1), prove (using partial summation) that <br>
the sum of 1/p for primes p up to x is loglog x + A + O(1/log x)
for an appropriate constant A.
<br><br>
(3) Show that psi(x) (the sum of the von Mangoldt values for n in [1,x])
is the logarithm of the least common multiple of the integers in [1,x].
<br><br>
(4) With theta(x) the sum of log p for p in [1,x], show the following
are equivalent:<br>
  (a) pi(x) = (1+o(1))x/log x<br>
  (b) theta(x) = (1+o(1))x<br>
  (c) psi(x) = (1+o(1))x
<br><br>
(5) Show that if pi(x) = (c+o(1))x/log x for some positive number c,
then c = 1.
</p>
<p>
Homework due Tuesday, January 11: <br>
(1) Give a simple proof that there are infinitely many primes that
are congruent to 1 modulo 3. <br>
(2) Show the sum of 1/(mp^m), over all primes p and all integers m at
least 2, is convergent.
