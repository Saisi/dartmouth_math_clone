<h2>   Mathematics for the Physical Sciences  - Fall 
2004</h2>

<b> Text: </b> Mathematics for the Physical Sciences (Term 1),  by Groszek 
and Mook available at Thayer Copy Center in Thayer Dining Hall 
(upstairs).           

<p>
  
<b>Grade</b>: Depending on which total grade is higher, your 
grade will be determined either as  
 homework  (10% of your grade),
2 midterms exam  (30% of your grade each),  
and a final exam  (the remaining 30% of your grade)
<bf> OR </bf> homework  (10% of your grade),
2 midterms exam  (20% of your grade each),
and a final exam  (the remaining 50% of your grade). 

<p>

<b>Exam Times:</b> We will have exams on the evenings of 
October 12th and November 9th from 7-9 p.m.. Our final will be on Sunday 
<a 
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/calendars/exams/04-05.html">December 
5th</a> at 3:00 p.m..   You are  expect to be  
free  at these times 
and must discuss any  legitimate  conflicts  with  Instructor  Leibon  <b> 
during  the first week of  class</b>.     

<p>

<b>Class Log:</b>   The homework assignments and exam  dates  can be 
found in the  class <a href="syl.html"> log.</a> 
When possible, you will have two homework assignments due each week week 
of the quarter,  due on Wednesday and Friday (since tutorial help is 
available on Tuesdays sand 
Thursdays).   Your  homework  will only be graded  if 
we can find your name and the assignment's number on it.  If you intend to 
turn in  multiple pages, then these pages <bf> must </bf> be stapled 
together.  
Homework will <bf> never 
</bf>  be accepted late, and any assignment not turned in on time will 
be recorded as a zero. However,  you will be allowed to drop your
lowest  homework score. 

<p>

<b>Honor  Principle</b>: 
On the exams, no help is to be given or received. On the homework, 
collaboration is permitted and encouraged, but NO  COPYING. In other 
words, you  should feel free to talk to other students while you are in 
the process  of thinking  about a problem. However, when it comes time to 
write up your  solutions, 
you must do this by yourself without outside assistance. 

<p>

<b>Students with disabilities</b>:  We encourage students with
disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases and 
learning disabilities, to discuss  with us  any
appropriate accommodations that 
might be helpful.

<p>

<b> Tutorial Sessions </b>: 
There is a tutorial session every Thursday  and Thursday evening  from 
7-9 in  Reed Room 104
where you can  receive advice on the course material (except during 
Thanksgiving break). 

<p>

<b>X-Session</b>: The X-session may be used to if we get 
behind in the syllabus or we are  forced to cancel lectures.  
For example,  we  <bf> not </bf>  be meeting on November 29th  and 
instead will be meeting  at the X-hour time on Tuesday October 5th and  
Tuesday October 19th   (see  
the <a href="syl.html">syllabus</a>).  

<p>

<b>Rough Syllabus</b> (<a href="syl.html"> Detailed Syllabus </a>):
Integrated Mathematics and Physical Science is a calculus course designed 
especially for students enrolled concurrently in Physics 15 or Physics 13.  
We will make a special effort to connect math topics with applications in  
the physical science and the material you are learning in physics.   Math 
15.1 and 15.2 give the preparation of Math 8 and 13 with the added bonus 
of being with other engineering, physics and 
chemistry majors.* 


<p>
A prerequisite to this course is a basic understanding of the calculus of 
functions of one variable.  In order to study physical systems in a world 
that appears to have three spacial dimensions,  one will clearly need to 
extend  the the notions of one variable calculus to at least  3 
dimensions.   In this course we begin this extension.  (For example: we 
will study vectors, Euclidean geometry, vector functions of one variable, 
line integrals, functions of 2 and three variables, and the gradient.) 
<p>
The language of calculus is useful in the description a of a wide variety 
of physical systems.  In particular, the laws governing such systems are 
often phrased using  a differential equation.  This course will also 
serve  a an introduction to the study of  such differential equations.    
(For  example: we will study first-order differential equations  and 
second-order constant-coefficient differential equations.)

<font size="-1"> *Comment: After taking Math 15.1 a student may transfer
into Math 13.  However, 
that student should take a look at the 
<a href="../../../m8f04/public_html/files/syl.html"> math 8 
syllabus</a>. In particular, such a student should attempt to learn the  
optimization techniques covered in math 8 (sections 15.7 and 15.8 in  
Stewart's calculus); a topic entirely skipped in Math 15.1 in order to 
make room  for  second-order constant-coefficient differential equations 
and the study of the harmonic oscillator.
