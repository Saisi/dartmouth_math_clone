<p>I doubt that Joseph Stalin gave the following gloomy definition, but it reflects the
essence of statistics:<font FACE="Palatino" SIZE="4"><i><b></p>

<p>&quot;Death of one man is a tragedy, deaths of millions is statistics&quot;</p>
</b></i></font><font FACE="Palatino">

<p>Statistics deals with data, sometimes with tons of data (messy data). The goal of
statistics is to draw inferences and information by means of analyzing the data.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Palatino" SIZE="5">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Statistics is a unique science because it can solve almost any real life
problem where the data can be collected. </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Use statistics once the data exist or you can collect them!</p>
</font><font FACE="Palatino"><i>

<p>Statistical approach involves four steps: </i></b></p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Data collection</strong> (sometimes data already exist). Statistician can play a
      significant role on this step to design experiment. In particular, he/she could help to
      answer the question: how much data to collect to make our future statistical inferences
      valid (significant). </li>
    <li><strong>Exploratory analysis</strong> involves some basic (preliminary) statistical
      analysis, first graphs, basic statistical characteristics such as means, standard
      deviations (descriptive statistics). This is a necessary step to understand what data are
      and what the data structure is. </li>
    <li><strong>Assumption (model) formulation</strong>. One cannot make a good statistical
      analysis without understanding the underlying assumptions of statistical method applied
      (otherwise he/she cannot justify why that specific method was chosen to analyze the data).</li>
    <li><b>Inferences.</b> At this step statistical analysis is finalized and conclusions are
      made possibly avoiding statistical language, so that the results of statistical analysis
      can be understood not only by statisticians. </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The role of computer is crucial in modern statistics.</i></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Examples:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The effect of a new treatment is under investigation. There are two groups of patients:
      'control' and 'treatment'. The first group did receive the conventional treatment and the
      second group did receive a new treatment. The number of successes in both groups are known
      (data). Is the new treatment more successful than the conventional one? This is a
      statistical problem (please name four steps mentioned above).</li>
    <li>You are in charge of making sales projection for the next year. The (non-statistical)
      question is: &quot;should the company, where you work, built a new facility due to the
      increase in sales?&quot; You collected data regarding sales and other relevant
      information, like general economic performance in the country, for several years prior to
      the prediction. What to do with this data to come up with projection? This is a
      statistical question (please name four steps, mentioned above).</li>
  </ul>

<p>There is a close relationship between these three approaches.</p>

<blockquote>
  <b><p>Probability</b>. Formally speaking any probability problem starts with defining a
  probability space, i.e. what kind of events are under consideration and what is the
  probability measure. The goal of the Theory of Probability is to find the probabilities of
  more complex events built up on the basis of elementary events. For instance, if you toss
  a fair dice elementary events are 1,2,3,4,5,6 with equal probability 1/6. A probabilistic
  question would be &quot;what is the probability to get more than 10 in two tosses?&quot;.</p>
  <b><p>Statistics is the inverse probability.</b> Probabilities are not defined in
  statistical problem -- on contrary, they must be <i>estimated</i> from the data (that is
  why it is called <i>inverse</i>). For example, a dice was tossed one thousand times and
  the results to get 1,2,3,4,5,6 respectively were {143,172,156,180,203,146}. A statistical
  question: &quot;Is the dice fair?&quot; Here we do not assume the outcomes to have equal
  probabilities, rather we <i>estimate</i> these probabilities and verify if they are equal.
  A characteristic feature of statistics is the availability of the underlying <i>model</i>,
  i.e. before starting statistical analysis we should make assumptions on the mechanism how
  data have been produced. Model is expressed in the language of the theory of probability
  where probability measure is unknown (some parameters are unknown). </p>
  <b><p>Data Analysis</b> is a broader interpretation of statistics. Unlike statistical
  approach we do not require formulate the underlying model. We just try this and that
  statistical method, make plots, etc, i.e. to dig out something informative and relevant to
  the problem we analyze. Recently it is called 'data mining'. </p>

<p>Besides intensive theoretical research (<a href="mywork/index.html">My Work</a>, <a
href="resume.html">Resume</a>), I was involved in many applied statistical projects with
broad range of goals: from long-term forecasting of American Economy and Business
Management to Optimal Plasma Coating and Cancer Radiology. I just would like to stress
that STATISTICS is one of the most powerful and interesting science I have ever known.
Statistical analysis can make substantial contribution to the subject once you have (or
you can collect) data. </p>
<b>

<p>Here is the list of projects I took part in (or what statistics can do): </b></p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Long-term forecasting of American Economy, funded by High Soviet Authorities. Methods
      used: econometric models, nonlinear growth curves advanced macroeconomics, production
      functions and capital accumulation theory (by Sollow).</li>
    <li>Sensitivity analysis of American Economy to the World Oil Production (Energy crisis
      modeling, I bet your parents still remember &quot;No Gas&quot; sign in the middle of
      seventies).</li>
    <li>Modeling of World Market of Gold, funded by the Ministry of Foreign Trade, USSR. </li>
    <li>Statistical methods of time series analysis and forecasting (commercial statistical
      package, software).</li>
    <li>Business Simulator, software. Educational tool to improve business performance via
      computer simulations. </li>
    <li>Optimal width distribution for plasma coating. </li>
    <li>Optimal portfolio analysis, funded by the Ministry of Foreign Trade, USSR.</li>
    <li>Cancer radiobiology. How tumor responses on radiation: modeling foundation.</li>
