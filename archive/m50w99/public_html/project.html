<p align="left"><font face="Palatino">The oldest and the most famous statistical problem
is the problem of how height of sons is correlated with the height of fathers. That
problem was posed by Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911) and gave rise to the most important
concept of statistics, <i>regression</i>. Galton discovered that taller fathers have
shorter sons, and that is why the according statistical relationship was called
'regression'. Hundreds (if not thousands) of studies have been made on this subject. We
will make a few more!</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino">The role of this team project is to apply the knowledge gained in
the course to a real life problems: what is the distribution of height and weight across
the gender, what are their main characteristics, how can we project weight given height
and vise versa, are weight and height correlated in relatives (siblings, children,
parents), does height converge, etc. I expect there will be four-five project topics
related to statistical problems of weight and height among family members. Also, we will
apply statistical hypothesis testing to verify if clothing industry follows the
distribution of heights of women and men (do cloth sizes in stores correspond to actual
proportions of people height?). What clothing companies know statistics better? You can
even write a letter to companies telling them about your findings!</p>

<p>We start with collecting data. So you will be asked to measure yourself and call up
your relatives (siblings and parents, adults only). Basically we will record height,
weight, and relationship. However, we will discuss in class what other measures can be
taken.</p>

<p>Each team will consist of four-five students, and the presentation will be held in
class toward the end of the course. Each member of the team will receive the same amount
of points. Maximum number of points the team can make is 15. The work on the project can
be started as soon as we collect data. Thus, we will have one data set and each team will
concentrate on a specific statistical problem related to that data set.</p>
