  <i><b><p>Methods of estimation and diagnostics for linear and nonlinear mixed effects
  models<ul type="square">
    <li></b></i><strong>Description:</strong> In classical regression analysis one deals with
      the dependent variable which may be represented as a vector (one dimension), and there is
      no correlation between components of that vector. In a fairly new statistical approach,
      called mixed effects, the dependent variable is a matrix (two dimensions). In a mixed
      effects model there are repeated measurements and components of the dependent variables
      are correlated. In particular, mixed effects modeling approach is used to analyze
      longitudinal data where each individual (subject or experimental unit) is observed in
      time. Recently two books have been published in this field: Davidian &amp; Giltinan.
      Nonlinear Models for Repeated Measurement Data and Vonesh &amp; Chinchilli (1997). Linear
      and Nonlinear Models for the Analysis of Repeated Measurements. This topic remains hot in
      statistics. I work on mixed effects and growth curves models from 1992 and published
      several papers, see below.<b><i></li>

  <p>Computational statistics, optimization algorithms, uniqueness and existence of
  estimates</i><ul type="square">
    <li><strong>Description:</strong> </b>Computations in statistics play a central role:
      statistics deals with data, to make statistical inference one must analyze data through
      major calculations which often involve optimization algorithms and iterative solutions.
      Statistics today is impossible without computer and relevant software. Unlike least
      squares estimate more complex statistical schemes lead to a non-quadratic minimization
      function, e.g. nonlinear regression or maximum likelihood for variance components or mixed
      effects model. The fundamental questions are: Does the global minimum exist (attain) and
      if it does how to verify that the found local minimum is, in fact, the global one. These,
      easy to formulate questions, puzzle statisticians and mathematicians for many years, not
      much progress has been done in this field, especially for the global minimum criteria. I
      work on these topics from 1981 and developments are promising.<b></li>

  <i><p>Regression diagnostics: infinitesimal influence analysis <ul type="square">
    <li></i></b><strong>Description:</strong> Regression diagnostics is a part of regression
      analysis, and more generally robustness of statistical model estimation and inference. A
      major concern of regression diagnostics and influence analyses is detecting influential
      observations and how they affect statistical inferences. Standard regression diagnostics
      include the following methodology: case deletion diagnostics, Cook&#146;s distance,
      leverage and standardized residuals analysis. In 1986 Dennis Cook proposed local influence
      approach applied to any statistical model (Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, ser.
      B). He suggested to measure how likelihood displacement is affected by small perturbation
      in data or model. We generalize that approach by considering any characteristic or
      estimate. Infinitesimal influence analysis can be applied virtually to any model or
      statistic and does not require distribution specification. Especially helpful it is for
      complex statistical models such as mixed effects models with repeated measurements. The
      advantages of the new approach are: easy of calculations, possibility of graphical
      representation, separated influence analysis for dependent and independent variables.<i><b></li>

  <p>Applied statistics. How tumor responses on radiation<ul type="square">
    <li></b></i><strong>Description:</strong> There is a well established theory of statistical
      growth curves, exponential, logistic, Gompertz, etc. However irradiated tumor does not
      follow these curves because it may decline and then re-grow. Statistical modeling of
      perturbed tumor in vivo is a long-standing problem. I develop a general re-growth curve
      theory where re-growth contains the radiation dose as a parameter. The idea is to combine
      the two established theories, growth curve and dose-response relationship (called survival
      curves in tumor and cancer literature) using cell kinetics modeling. An adequate tumor
      re-growth curve may provide a powerful quantitative tool to contrast different radiation
      schemes, optimal fractionation, probability of tumor control for different tumor models. </li>

    alternative regression schemes such as regression with stochastic independent
    (explanatory) variables, robust and M- regression, regression under multicollinearity and
    ridge regression, errors-in-variables, heteroscedastic residuals, and nonlinear

  <li><strong>Demidenko E. (1989).<i> Optimization and Regression (in Russian), Moscow, Nauka</i>.</strong><br>
    Many optimization problems emerge from statistics and data analysis. Optimization is an
    important part of statistical calculations and nonlinear regression particularly. This
    book considers the problem of sum of squares of residuals minimization in detail. Three
    major topics are discussed: Existence, Uniqueness, Calculation. In nonlinear regression,
    unlike linear regression, the Least Squares estimate may not exists -- we provide some
    criteria for LS estimate existence. Again, unlike linear regression, the Sum of Squares
    may have several local minima &#150; we provide sufficient criteria to verify whether the
    found local minimum is the global one, i.e., corresponds to the true LS estimate.
    Different algorithms for the SS minimizations and other related computational issues are
    also considered.<br>
