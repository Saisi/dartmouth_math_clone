<p align="center"><font size="5"><strong>Business Simulator</strong><br>
</font><font size="4">is an interactive PC program designed to teach students of business
the value strategic decisions making to enhance economic performance</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Business Simulator (BUS) software consists of four screens/sheets: Income
Statement, Cash Flow Statement, Balance Sheet, and Management Decisions Sheet. There are
three modes of using BUS: Case Study, Simulation and Game mode. In Case Study mode student
can analyze each business decision separately, choosing one of the business performance:
goal is achieved (good performance),&nbsp; goal is partially achieved (satisfactory
performance), and goal is not achieved (bad performance). Simulation mode does not give
full control over performance so that student can see the result of business decisions as
it happens in real life. At last, students (or group of students) can compete playing
Business Simulator Game.</p>

<p align="left">Four years of business performance are compared: last, prior, current, and
next. Last and prior years are displayd to see previous business performance, as the
benchmark of the current and next years performance. Student picks different business
decisions and see the consequences comparing the resulted income, cash flow and balance in
the current and next year versus last and prior years.</p>

<p align="center">For instance, after selecting 'Reduce Working Capital' income was
improved by $20,000 but current cash dropped by $1248,000, as one can see from the
following screen snapshot.</p>

<p align="center">A detail analysis may be accomplished by comparing Income Statement
Sheet for current and next year. In particular, as follows from the next screen snapshot,
Interest Expense was reduced from $553,000 in the last year to $533,000 in the &nbsp;
current year.</p>

<p align="center">Below the results of decision making was analyzed for Balance Sheet.
Although 'Reduce Working Capital' improves income it does not help creating cash.</p>

<p align="center">This software may be an excelent teaching tool not only for students but
also for businessmen who want to analyze the results of their decisions on computer before
realizing them in real life.</p>
