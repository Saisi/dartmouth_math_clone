<B>Resources at Dartmouth:</B>

<Blockquote>

Below you will find two kinds of material, each in an experimental state of development:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>Video segments showing calculus problems being worked out by hand-- We have chosen a problem a day, each on a topic from the syllabus. We have invited mathematicians from our Math Department to work out the solutions just as they would at a tutorial session. We invite you to view these segments and give us your feedback. The formats are not all the same because we want to determine what works best for students.</P>

<P>In fact, we are asking for student volunteers who would be video taped working on a few calculus problems with a graduate student guiding them. The week we are looking to do this is October 9 thru 14 except for the 13th. Send email to <A HREF="mailto:C.Dwight.Lahr@dartmouth.edu">Dwight Lahr</A> if you are interested. It should be fun. </P>

   </ul>

<P>

<LI>Class notes, available sometime after the class has met-- We will keep you posted on our success in getting these onto the web.

You may wish to browse the sites below to see some different approaches to topics
discussed in Math 3. If you find a link that you think should be added to the list, send a note to <A HREF="mailto:C.Dwight.Lahr@dartmouth.edu">Dwight Lahr</A> with a brief description.

<UL>

<LI>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's <A
HREF="http://links.math.rpi.edu"><B>Project Links</B></A> has developed a
collection of interactive web-based applications that link mathematical topics with applications in engineering and science.  Along with calculus modules are ones involving
mechanics, probablitity and statistics, and differential equations.

<P>

<LI>This page at the <A
HREF="http://www.math.upenn.edu/~ugrad/macmatc/modules/modules.html"><B>MACMATC</B></A>
(Middle Atlantic Consortium for Mathematics and its Applications Throughout the
Curriculum) includes several relevant worksheets on topics such as velocity and
exponential growth.  An action packed video brings home the realities of
exponential cockroach population growth.

<P>

<LI><A
HREF="http://www.math.unl.edu/~sdunbar/Maple/MapleandMath/mapleandmath.html"><B>This
page</B></A> at the University of Nebraska includes downloadable Maple help
sheets and a list of Maple resources.

<P>

<LI><A
HREF="http://archives.math.utk.edu/visual.calculus/"><B>Visual Calculus</B></A>  is a collection of modules that can be used in the study of calculus.

<P>

<LI>Contained on <A
HREF="http://www.math.psu.edu/dna/graphics.html"><B>this
page</B></A> is a collection of graphical demonstrations for first year calculus.

<P>

<LI>Part of the mission statement of <A
HREF="http://tango.mth.umassd.edu/"><B>this
group</B></A> is "to enable ALL students to develop full understanding and practical skill with fundamental concepts of the mathematics of change in meaningful contexts."
