<P><B>What is WeBWorK?</B></P>

<P>WeBWorK is a system that allows professors to put the homework problems on the Web and allows students to solve these problems over the Web. Students may try to answer homework problems more than once. After each try, a message appears telling the student whether the answer is correct or not. This allows students to try to find out what they did wrong and hopefully to understand the topic of the question better. It also identifies areas where a student may want to seek help by going to a tutorial session or working in a group.</P>

<P>Each WeBWorK problem set is individualized. That is, each student has a different version of each problem; for example, the numerical values in the formulas may be slightly different. This means that students should not feel reluctant to discuss homework problems with other students because each student has to enter his or her own answers into the system to get credit.</P>

<P><B>How to Get Extra Practice</B></P>

<P>It is also possible to get extra practice by logging in as a practice user. Use practice1 as the login name and practice1 again as the password. Or if practice1 is being used, you can login as practice2, practice3, or practice4 (using the login name as the password) until you find one that is free.</P>

<P><B>How to Use WeBWorK to do your Homework</B></P>

<P>Start Netscape or Internet Explorer on your Mac or PC, and go directly to the Math 3 sign-in page <A HREF="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/webwork/m3">http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/webwork/m3</A>. (Alternatively, you could go to the index page http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/webwork/ that lists all Dartmouth mathematics courses using WeBWorK. On that page, you click on the Math 3 course.)</P>

<P>This will take you to a login page. Enter your login name and password, and click on the 'Continue' button. (Before logging in, be sure to check your email. You should have received an email message telling you your login name and initial password.)</P>

<P>Then proceed in either order:
<UL>
<li>Look at and do the problems in a set from the Homework page of the Math 3 Website. To do Set m3f00day01, for example, click on that line in the box. Then click on the 'Do problem set' button. At this point, the problems of the set are listed. You can select the first problem in the list, for example, and begin to solve it and fill in the answers.

<li>Or you may prefer to get a hard copy of the problems, work out most of the details with pencil and paper, and then go to WeBWorK to input the answers. To get a printout of Set m3f00day01, first choose the download type. In most cases, "pdf" should work if you have the free Acrobat Reader installed.  
</UL>
</P>

<P><U>Note</U>:Because WeBWorK is able to do arithmetic, it usually is not necessary to work out complete numerical answers with pencil and paper  or a calculator in advance of inputting answers.</P>

<P><B>FAQs</B></P>

<P>That is enough to get started. After you have tried logging in and have gained some experience with the system, you will want to consult the page of WeBWorK <A HREF="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/webwork_local/students_FAQ.html">Frequently Asked Questions</A>. Have fun.
