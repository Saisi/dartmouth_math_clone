<B>Homework:</B> Our homework grader is Adeel Meer.  He has requested that each section's homework be turned in on a separate page, and that the pages be stapled together.  He is willing to be blitzed about any questions you may have.  He has been asked to give a grade of 2 for each set for substantially complete solutions, 0 for poor or no solutions, and 1 for a set in between.  Your homework score may count for your grade if you end up between two grades; otherwise not.<HR>
