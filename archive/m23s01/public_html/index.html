<p><b>Textbook:</b><font size=+1>&nbsp; <i>Elementary Differential Equations
and Boundary Value Problems</i></font>
<br><font size=+1>by William E. Boyce and Richard C. DiPrima, 7th edition.</font>
<p><b>Homework:</b><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp; Daily homework and reading
will be assigned each class period</font>
<br><font size=+1>and due <b>before </b>the next class period.&nbsp; There
will also be a few longer homework</font>
<br><font size=+1>assignments, distributed periodically during the term,
which you will have one or</font>
<br><font size=+1>two weeks to complete.&nbsp; Homework will be graded
out of 10 points, and you will</font>
<br><font size=+1>receive an automtic five points for making an attempt
at all the problems.&nbsp; Late</font>
<br><font size=+1>homework is eligible only for the automatic 5 points.&nbsp;
If you have a valid reason</font>
<br><font size=+1>for turning in homework late (such as illness or a family
emergency) please talk to</font>
<br><font size=+1>your professor.&nbsp; Your lowest two daily homework
grades will be dropped before</font>
<br><font size=+1>computing your end-of-term average.</font>

<p><font size=+1>There will be one final exam, to be scheduled by the registrar.&nbsp;
If you have a</font>
<br><font size=+1>conflict with a midterm exam, please talk to your professor
<b>as
soon as possible</b></font>
<br><font size=+1>about scheduling an alternate time.&nbsp; Final exams
are given only during the</font>
<br><font size=+1>scheduled times; please do not make plans to leave campus
during final exam</font>
<br><font size=+1>period before you know when your finals are scheduled.&nbsp;
Calculators are not</font>
<br><font size=+1>allowed on exams.</font>
<p><b>Grading:</b><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grades in Math 23 will
be computed as follows:&nbsp; Homework 20%,</font>
<br><font size=+1>midterms 25% each, final 30%.</font>
<p><b>Honor Principle:</b><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every student
who matriculates at Dartmouth agrees to</font>
<br><font size=+1>abide by the academic honor principle.&nbsp; You have
an obligation to act with</font>
<br><font size=+1>integrity in your own academic work, and to take action
if you observe honor</font>
<br><font size=+1>code violations by others.&nbsp; Academic integrity is
essential to the scholarly</font>
<br><font size=+1>enterprise and we take it seriously.</font>
<p><font size=+1>In Math 23, you are encouraged to work together on homework
problems,</font>
<br><font size=+1>and to use professors, other students, other textbooks,
and generally any</font>
<br><font size=+1>resource you can find that will help you understand and
work the problems.</font>
<br><font size=+1>You must write up the homework solutions by&nbsp; yourself
in your own words.</font>
<br><font size=+1>In brief, collaborate but don't copy.</font>
<p><font size=+1>You must do all work on exams independently, without giving
or receiving</font>
<br><font size=+1>assistance of any kind.</font>
<p><font size=+1><b>Special Concerns:&nbsp;</b> Please talk to your professor
as soon as possible, or</font>
<br><font size=+1>whenever something comes up, about any special concerns
you have about the</font>
<br><font size=+1>class.&nbsp; If you have a disability and may require
disability-related accommodations,</font>
<br><font size=+1>talk to the professor as soon as possible; this includes
invisible disabilities like</font>
<br><font size=+1>chronic diseases, learning disabilities, and psychiatric
disabilities.&nbsp; If you have</font>
<br><font size=+1>athletic or other extracurricular commitments and hope
to accommodate them</font>
<br><font size=+1>(for example, by taking midterms at alternative times),
talk to the professor.&nbsp; If</font>
<br><font size=+1>you are ill and fall behind on work, talk to the professor.&nbsp;
If you are in any way</font>
<br><font size=+1>concerned about the course or your performance in it,
talk to the professor.</font>
<br><font size=+1>If you can't do the homework, talk to the professor.
Make an appointment,</font>
<br><font size=+1>either after class or viaphone or blitzmail, if you can't
make regular office</font>
<br><font size=+1>hours.&nbsp; We are here and we want to see you.</font>
