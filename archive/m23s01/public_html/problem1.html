<b>Problem due Monday April 9</b>
<p>A chain of length 3 feet has linear mass density of&nbsp; 0.2&nbsp;
pounds per foot.
<br>The coefficient of friction between the chain and my desk is&nbsp;
0.5.&nbsp; I hold
<br>the chain on my desk with&nbsp; 2&nbsp; feet hanging over the edge
and let go.
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Write down a differential equation, with initial conditions,
that describes
<br>the motion of the chain after I release it.&nbsp; Let&nbsp; y(t) be
the length of the chain
<br>(in feet) hanging over the edge of the desk at time&nbsp; t&nbsp; seconds
after it is released.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Solve the differential equation you wrote down in (a)
by converting it
<br>to a system of two first order equations (reduction of order).&nbsp;
The answer to
<br>this part of the problem should be a general solution to the differential
equation.
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; Now solve the initial value problem you wrote down in
part (a).
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp; Find a solution to the differential equation you wrote
down in part (a)
<br>with the initial conditions&nbsp; y(0) = 0&nbsp; and&nbsp; y'(0) =
0.
<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the solution you found in (d) describe the motion
of the chain if
<br>it placed on the table with no part hanging off the edge?&nbsp; Why
or why not?
