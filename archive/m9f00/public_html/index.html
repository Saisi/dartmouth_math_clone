<h2>Math 9 (Calculus) - Fall 2000</h2>
<hr>

<P>

<b>FINAL EXAM NEWS</b>:  The final is on Monday, December 4, from 4:00 to 6:00 P.M. in Filene auditorium.  The
format is just like the other exams:  no notes, no books, no calculators.  

<P>

<b>Tutorials</b>:  Rudel will be holding office hours from 2-4 P.M. Thursday in his office
(Bradley 1-A (in the basement)) and by appointment
over
the weekend (note:  no office hours Friday).  <a href="mailto:rudel@dartmouth.edu">Email him</a> to set up a
time.  Further, there will be an
official tutorial on Sunday night at the usual time and place (7-9 in Wilder 104).

<P>

<b>Practice Exam</b>:  There is a list of practice problems on top of the homework boxes in Bradley.  
<a href="prac1/prac1.html">This disclaimer</a> still applies.  The last eight problems on the list
are actually last year's math 9 final exam.  The syllabus last year was similar, but there was more emphasis on
some topics and less on others.  For that reason, this final wouldn't be completely appropriate as a final for
this term, but it's not too far off.  By Thursday afternoon (hopefully) there will also be a sheet containing
solutions/answers/hints to the
practice
problems.  If you find any typos or errors on either the practice problems themselves or the solutions
(regrettably, the haste with which they were written up makes this a distinct possibility), <a
href="mailto:drinen@dartmouth.edu">let me know</a> and I'll post a list of corrections here.

<b>Tutorials</b>: Tuesday and Sunday nights from 7:00-9:00 in Wilder
104 and Thursday nights from 5:00-7:00 in Bradley 101.

<b>Grade</b>: Your grade will be determined as follows:
<PRE>
Category                 Weight         
----------------------------------     
homework                  15%            
2 mid-term exams          25% each      
final exam                35%                                                  
</PRE>   

<P>

<b>Exams</b>: There will be two midterm exams and a final.  The date and 
time is not yet set for any of the exams.  Expect the first mid-term around 
October 12, and the second sometime in mid-November.  Note that these 
are very rough estimates.
<br>
<b>UPDATE:</b>  The first midterm has now come and gone.  For reference here is the <a
href="prac1/prac1.html">practice exam</a> that went with the first midterm.
<BR>
<b>FINAL EXAM UPDATE:</b> The date and time of the final is now official:  Monday, December 4, from 4:00 to 6:00
p.m.  
The room has not been set yet. <i>Remember, plane reservations are not a sufficient reason to take the final
early.</i>


<P>

<b>Makeup policy</b>: Homework will be assigned (almost) every class
period, and will be due at the next class meeting.  <i>No late
homework will be accepted for any reason</i>, but your three lowest
homework scores will be dropped before computing your grade.  Thus you
may miss up to three homework assignments without penalty.
<P>

Makeup tests will only be given in case of legitimate emergencies.  

<P>

<b>Honor policy</b>:
Collaboration is encouraged during the process of
thinking about homework problems, but is not acceptable while writing
up your final solutions.  That is, working together on homework is
fine, but copying is not.  

<p>

No collaboration of any form is acceptable during exams.

<p>

<b>Students with disabilities</b>:  Any student with a
documented disability needing academic adjustments or
accommodations is requested to speak with the professor by the
end of the second week of the term.  All discussions will remain
confidential, although the Academic Skills Center may be
consulted to verify the documentation of the disability.
