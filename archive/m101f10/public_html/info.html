<br>

</p>

<p> The final grade for the course will be based on weekly homework assignments (30%), one midterm (30%) 
and one final exam (40%) (both in-class exams).  
</p>

<b>Homework:</b> 
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><img
 src="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m101f10/blueball.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;
Homework will be assigned weely and it will be posted in the homework page.  It will be collected
every Tuesday during the x-hour.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><img

Graduate students will present solutions during the x-hour.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><img

I would strongly prefer that homework be typed in latex. If homework is handwritten 
it must be written neatly, otherwise I will return it ungraded.

<span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><u9:p></u9:p><b>Honor Code:</b> <u9:p></u9:p></b></span>
<br>


<b>On Homework</b>: Students are encouraged to work together to do homework problems. 
What is important is a student's eventual understanding of homework problems, and not 
how that is achieved. The honor principle applies to homework in the following way. 
What a student turns in as a homework solution is to be his or her own understanding of 
how to do the problem. Students must state what sources they have consulted, with whom 
they have collaborated, and from whom they have received help. Students are discouraged 
from using solutions to problems that may be posted on the web, and as just stated, must 
reference them if they use them. The solutions you submit must be written by you alone. 
Any copying (electronic or otherwise) of another person's solutions, in whole or in part, 
is a violation of the Honor Code.
<br><br>
Moreover, if in working with someone they have provided you with an important idea or approach, 
they should be explicitly given credit in your writeup. Hints I give in office hours need not be 
cited. Note: It is not sufficient to annotate your paper with a phrase like 
``I worked with Joe on all the problems.'' Individual ideas are to be credited at each instance; 
they represent intellectual property.
<br><br>
<b>On Exams:</b> Students may not receive assistance of any kind from any source (
living, published, electronic, etc), except the professor, and may not give assistance to anyone. 
Matters of clarification are to be left to the professor. If you have any questions as to whether 
some action would be acceptable under the Academic Honor Code, please speak to me, and I will be 
glad to help clarify things. It is always easier to ask beforehand.

<span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><u9:p></u9:p><b>Disabilities and Religious Observances:</b> <u9:p></u9:p></b></span>
<br>


I encourage any students with disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities such as chronic 
diseases and learning disabilities, to discuss appropriate accommodations with me, which might 
help you with this class, either after class or during office hours. Dartmouth College has an 
active program to help students with disabilities, and I am happy to do whatever I can to help 
out, as appropriate.
<br><br>
Any student with a documented disability requiring academic adjustments or accommodations is 
requested to speak with me by the end of the second week of the term. All discussions will remain 
confidential, although the Academic Skills Center may be consulted to verify the documentation of 
the disability and advise on an appropriate response to the need. It is important, however, that 
you talk to me soon, so that I can make whatever arrangements might be needed in a timely fashion.
<br><br>

Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. 
If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet 
with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.
