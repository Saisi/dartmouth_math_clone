<h1>Exam Page</h1>










<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Exam: </span>The final exam will be held Saturday morning from 8:00-11:00 in <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">108 Kemeny Hall</span>. &nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">THIS IS NOT OUR USUAL CLASSROOM!</span>
&nbsp;The final exam will be cumulative, but will most likely stress
the material covered towards the end of the course rather than towards
the beginning. &nbsp;Of course, the exam will be closed book and closed
notes. &nbsp;I will have office hours Thursday from 2-3 and Friday from
10-11 and 2-3. &nbsp;(We covered through most of section 6.<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">5</span>.)</p>


<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exam II:</span> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The
second midterm exam will be given in our x-hour on Thursday, May 8th.
&nbsp;The exam will cover all material we have covered in the course up
to and including Friday's lecture on section 5.3 of the text.
&nbsp;However, this exam will focus on material covered since the first
exam. &nbsp;That is, the exam will be primarily on material from
Chapter 4 as well as series, Taylor series and power series. &nbsp;The
format will be very much like the first exam. &nbsp;The will be an
in-class portion and a take home portion </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">both of which are closed book and closed notes</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.
&nbsp;The in-class portion will be given during the x-hour and the take
home portion will be due the next class on Friday, May 9th at 10am.
</span>&nbsp;</span></p>




<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exam II Results</span>: <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The
performance on this exam was a bit mixed -- although still pretty good
on average. &nbsp;Problem #7 was a disaster. &nbsp;I was surprized by
this, since it was nearly identical to a homework problem: &sect;4.6,
#7. &nbsp;</span></p>

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To form an </span><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">estimate</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
of your grade to date in the class, I have written a score out of 70 on
your exams for your grade on the first 6 homework assignments. &nbsp;If
you add this to the total of your first two exam scores, then you can
approximate your grade as follows:</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">




<ul style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">




  <li>A: more than 220</li>




  <li>B: more than 195</li>




  <li>C: more than 160</li>




  <li>D: more than 130</li>




</ul>




<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">It goes without saying that if
your total is near one of these cut-offs, then you should consider the
corresponding letter even more of an approximation.</span>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exam I:</span> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Our
first exam will be given in our x-hour on Thursday, April 17th at 12.
&nbsp;The exam will cover up to an including lecture on Friday (April
11th). &nbsp;That means the lectures, homework and reading through and
including section 3.5 of the text. &nbsp;There will be two components
to the exam -- each of which will be </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">closed book and closed notes</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.
&nbsp;The "in class" portion will be given during the x-hour and
collected at the end of class. &nbsp;The "take-home" portion will be
due the next day, Friday, at the beginning of class. &nbsp;The
take-home portion will consist of 4-5 "homework like" problems.
&nbsp;The in-class questions will be more straightforward and
objective. &nbsp;I will probably ask you to state some definitions
and/or important results from lecture. &nbsp;Some straightforward
computations and true/false questions would also be fair game.</span></p>








<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 51, 0);"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Exam I Results</span>:
&nbsp;On the whole, the class did very well on the first exam.
&nbsp;(Taking your first exam in a new course from a new instructor is
always a bit of an adjustment.) &nbsp;</span></p>

<span style="color: rgb(0, 51, 0);">To give you an estimate of where
you stand in the course to date, I converted your homework scores on
the first three assignments to a score out of 35. &nbsp;(I wrote this
on your exam.) &nbsp;Based on the total of your exam grade and homework
grade, your grade to date can be approximated as follows:<br>







</span>
<ul style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">







  <li>A: more that 110.</li>







  <li>B: 100-110</li>







  <li>C: 90-100</li>







  <li>D: less than 90</li>
