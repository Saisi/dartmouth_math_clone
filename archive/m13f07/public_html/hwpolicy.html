<br><br>
There will be three types of homework assigned in this course, the reason for this is to help you
learn the material, you have to be aware that to learn mathematics you actually
have to do mathematics. You cannot really learn just by watching me or the TA solve problems for you.
Also remember that homework is a dress rehearsal for the exams. 
<br><br>
For better results I recommend that you do the reading assignment first, then the practice assignment
and finally the writting assignment. It would be great if you formed a study group so that you can 
teach someone else the material, this way you would trully master the concepts.  
<br><br>
<b>Reading Assignment: </b> What reading math? Yes, most students that are successful in mathematics 
actually read their books/notes first to understand the concepts before attempting problems. This will 
save you lots of time since you don't have to be guessing what the definitions when doing
the problems. Also reading will acquaint you with your book and hopefully reduce the things that 
you have to learn the night before the exam. Reading the book first is a smarter way to study.
<br><br>

<b>Practice Problems: </b> This one is obvious, you have to first practice easy problems to build 
your confidence. This will be done in the computer using WeBWork so that you get immediate feedback. 
If you cannot do these problems and you have done the reading assignment then you should go see the 
TA or come to see me. Sometimes you have forgotten something from some previous class and I or 
the TA can remind you.
<br><br>
<b>Written Assignment: </b> These problems will be a bit more challenging and will check 
whether you have understood the material, it is due once a week; however, please do not leave
it until 10PM the night before it is due because chances are you won't be able to finish it. 
These problems are intended to give you a better preparation and a deeper understanding of what 
you have learned during the previous week. 
<br><br>

The following are some guidelines when preparing your written assignment:
<br>
<ul>

<li> I recommend that you buy a binder instead of a notebook for this class. It will be easier to 
add remove assignments and this way you will be more organized. 

<li> Late homework will not be accepted under any circumstances, please do not ask for 
extensions.  I will, however, allow you to drop the lowest score in the written assignments
and you can skip up to two of the practice problem sets without penalty. 


<li>
Written homework will be assigned daily and will be collected once a week
&nbsp; at the beginning of class.</li>
<li>
All homework assignments will be posted on the course assignment's
<b><a href="hw.html">webpage</a></b>.</li>
<li>  Always read the feedback given on your written assignments, it will help you understand 
what you missed and also help you when you study for exams.</li> 

<li>Late and missing papers count zero. It is your responsibility to keep track of all your papers
so please make sure that you keep them until you know your final grade.</li>

<li>
Homework is to be written <b>neatly</b> using both sides of 8 1/2 x 11
inch paper. Do <b>not</b> use paper from a spiral notebook unless you can
tear off the ragged edge. All papers are to be stapled.</li>

<li>
Use <b>English</b>. If you can't read your solutions aloud as fluently
as if you were reading a textbook, try using nouns and verbs in your write
ups!</li>
</ul>
If you do not follow these guidelines, your homework will be returned to
you ungraded.
