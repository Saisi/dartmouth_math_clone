<UL><LI><B>Covered today:</B>  We stated Theorem, Section
36 (the Cauchy-Goursat Theorem), and proved a weakened form of it.  We won't prove the full C-G
theorem until next week.  In the mean time, we will start to examine some of its consequences, such
as the two theorems and two corollaries in Section 38.  

<P>

<LI><B>For next time:</B>  Study for the midterm, which is on Monday.
