<b>FINAL NOTES:</b>  The take-home portion of the final was distributed last Friday.  It is due at the
in-class final, which is Monday, June 5th from 9:00-11:00 a.m. in Bradley 102.  I will be there at 8:30
if you would like to start early.  If you have any questions about the take-home final, feel free to
ask me.  I won't give hints that are quite as helpful as I would on homework problems, but it can't hurt
to ask.

V. Churchill

<p>

<b>Grade</b>: Your grade will be determined as follows:

<PRE>
Category                 Weight         
----------------------------------     
homework and quizzes      30%            
mid-term exam             30%       
final exam                40%                                                  
</PRE>   

<p>

<b>Exams</b>:  The date, time, and format of both exams are yet to be
determined.  

<p>

<b>Makeup policy</b>: Homework will be assigned (almost) every class
period, and will be due at the next class meeting.  <i>No late
homework will be accepted for any reason</i>, but your three lowest
homework scores will be dropped before computing your grade.  Thus you
may miss up to three homework assignments without penalty.

<p>

Makeup tests will only be given in case of legitimate emergencies.  

<p>

<b>Honor policy</b>:
<ul>
<li>Collaboration is encouraged during the process of
thinking about homework problems, but is not acceptable while writing
up your final solutions.  That is, working together on homework is
fine, but copying is not.  
<li>No collaboration of any form is acceptable during exams.
</ul>

<p>

<b>Students with disabilities</b>:  I encourage students with
disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases
and learning disabilities, to discuss with me any appropriate accommodations
that might be helpful.
