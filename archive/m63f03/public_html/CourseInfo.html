<B> Text-book: </B> <i> Real Analysis with Real Applications</I>, 
Kenneth R. Davidson & Allan P. Donsig, publisher Prentice Hall, 2002, 
ISBN 0-13-041647-9.<br>
<B> Suggested reading: </B> <i> Principles of Mathematical Anlysis</i>,
Walter Rudin, 3rd edition, publisher McGraw-Hill, Inc.
<BR><br>


<B> Brief organizational description: </B> 
The way the class will be conducted may be new for most of you. The lecturing
time is cut in half and the remaining time is devoted to `guided
discovery' of the material. In other words, in small groups, you will
investigate relevant examples, details, proofs etc. The emphasis
will be on the student participation and interaction, 
on discovery and appreciation of the subject, 
and on rigorous writing/formulation of the arguments. <BR><br>


<B> Grading policy: </B> <BR><br>
40%, homework (assigned daily);<br>
30%, 10% each, three midterm exams (October 8, in-class; October 29, 6-8 PM;
November 12, in-class);<br>
20%, comprehensive final exam (December 9, 8:00-11:00 AM);<BR>
10% class participation.

<BR><BR>


<b> Homework: </b> It will be posted on:

<!--
Late homework is not permitted for any reason!
-->
<br><br>

<b> x-hour: </b> It will be held every week.
<br><br>

<!--
<b> Quizzes: </b> Will be announced a week in advanced. They do not count
towards the final grade, but would be helpful to monitor your progress in 
understanding the material.
<br><br>
-->

<B> Pieces of advice: </B> <br>
(1) Work hard from the very beginning. Do 
<I> not </I> let the material accumulate without working through it.
<BR><br> (2) Do not hesitate to ask me questions (during the class
and after class). Come to the office hours.
<BR><br> (3) Read the <i>honor principle</i> of Dartmouth College. 
Working in small groups you will discuss among yourselves the ideas
of the course, but the homework and the exams 
should reflect your <I> own </I> understanding of the subject.

<BR><BR>
I wish you an enjoyable and fruitful semester!
<br>
