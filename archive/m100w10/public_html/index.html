			<p style="text-align : justify"> This course studies a mathematical
			  model for flow through a porous material.  Though simple and elegant,
			  the model exhibits fascinating behavior and makes use of a panorama of
			  mathematical techniques from probability, geometry, analysis and
			  combinatorics.  The material is suitable for an advanced undergraduate
			  math major or any level of graduate student; no particular prerequisite
			  (although the equivalent of Math 20 would be helpful).<br>

			Due Tuesday 1/12: Compute the critical probabilities p_H and p_T
 			for bond percolation on the <a href="lozenge.pdf">2-branching lozenge tree</a>.
			</p>
                        <p> Due Thursday 1/14: Compute the theta-function for a 3-regular
			Bethe lattice (that is, a tree in which every vertex has degree 3).
                        </p>
			<p> Due Tuesday 1/19: Prove Harris' Lemma (constant p will do),
			showing explicit justification for "the second inequality
			following from (6)" (middle of p. 40 of your text).
			</p>
			<p> Due Thursday 1/21: Prove that Bridg-It cannot end in a draw.
			Make use of the technology of our Peierls argument!
			</p>
			<p> Due Tuesday 1/26: Let <i>G</i> be the Shannon Switching Game played on
			the graph with vertices <i>s, t, a</i> and <i>b</i>, and edges <i>sa, sb, at, bt</i> and <i>ab</i>.
			(a) Who wins <i>G</i>, playing alternating moves: Short, Cut or first player?
			(b) With what probability does Short win the random-turn version of <i>G</i>?
			(c) Up do what amount should Short be willing to offer Cut for the
			privilege of first move, if each starts with $1 in the Richman version of <i>G</i>?
			</p>
			<p> Due Thursday 1/28: use our Harris' Theorem argument to prove that at <i>p</i> = 1/2, the 
			probability that the radius of the open cluster containing (0,0) exceeds <i>n</i> is
			bounded by <i>n</i>^{-<i>c</i>}, for some positive constant <i>c</i>.
			</p>
			<p> Due Tuesday 2/2: Find the "right" increasing function <i>g(n)</i> such that
			when <i>A</i> is the event "at least half the coordinates are 1s" in <i>Q^n</i>, then
			the derivative of <i>P_p(A)</i> at <i>p = 1/2</i> is at least <i>t(1-t)g(n)</i>, where <i>t = P_{1/2}(A)</i>.
			</p>
			<p> Due Thursday 2/4: Use Cayley's Theorem (and hints from class) to show that the number
			of size-<i>n</i> trees rooted at <i>v</i> in a lattice of max degree <i>D</I> is at most <i>(eD)^n</i>.
			</p>
			<p> Due Tuesday 2/9: Show that a random variable <i>N</i> of range {1,2,...,<i>n</i>} and
			expectation <i>cn</i> must have probability at least <i>c/2</i> of exceeding <i>cn/2</i>.
			</p>
			<p> Due Thursday 2/11: Can there be more than one infinite open cluster in independent
			percolation on the square grid, when <i>p > p_c</i>? 
			</p>
			<p> Due Tuesday 2/16: You are given a large amount of material with which to make a screen
			from sticks of length 1 mm and cross-sectional area <i>t</i> square microns, for any <i>t</i> you want.
			Such a stick breaks with probability <i>1/2^t</i>.  What lattice and what value of <i>t</i> should
			you use, to maximize the size of your screen while assuring that it won't fall apart?
			</p>
			<p> Due Tuesday 2/23: Let <i>K</i> be any nonempty subset of the discrete hypercube <i>Q_n</i>,
			and for <i>x, y</i> in <i>K</i> put <i>x</i> adjacent to <i>y</i> iff no other element of <i>K</i>
			belongs to the subcube [<i>x,y</i>].  Prove that the resulting graph is connected.
			</p>
			<p> Due Thursday 2/25: Let <i>H</i> be the hex grid on a discrete domain with boundary arcs <i>A_1, A_2</i>
			and <i>A_3</i>.  Pick any site of <i>H</i> with neighboring cells <i>x_1, x_2, x_3</i> labeled in the
			same (counter-clockwise) order as the boundary arcs.  Let <i>B_i</i> be the event that <i>x_i</i> and
			<i>A_i</i> are connected by an open path, <i>W_i</i> by a closed path, assuming critical face percolation
			on <i>H</i>.  Letting <i>#</i> represent the disjoint "box" product, which is more likely,
			<i>B_1 # B_2 # B_3</i> or <i>W_1 # B_2 # B_3</i>?
			</p>
			<p> Due Tuesday 3/2: For a binary string <i>x</i> in the uniform discrete hypercube <i>Q_n</i>, let <i>x'</i>
			denote the result of flipping all the bits in <i>x</i>, and for any set <i>S</i> let <i>S' := {x'|x in S}</i>
			so that <i>P(S)=P(S')</i>.  Let <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> be two up-events in <i>Q_n</i>.  Find an example
			where <i>P(A # B) < P(A</i> and <i>B)</i>, or one where <i>P(A # B) > P(A</i> and <i>B)</i>, or both (if
			possible).

		  </td>
		  <td>

			<p style="text-align : justify"> Students are encouraged
			to work together to do homework problems. What is
			important is a student's eventual understanding of
			homework problems, and not how that is achieved. The honor
			principle applies to homework in the following way. <span
			style="color:#CC0000; font-weight:bold">What a student
			turns in as a written homework solution is to be his or her own
			understanding of how to do the problem. Students must
			state what sources they have consulted, with whom they
			have collaborated, and from whom they have received
			help.</span> Students are discouraged from using solutions
			to problems that may be posted on the web,
			and as just stated, must
			reference them if they use them. The solutions you submit
			must be written by you alone.  Any copying (electronic or
			otherwise) of another person's solutions, in whole
			or in part, is a violation of the Honor Code.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align : justify">If you have any questions as to whether some action
			would be acceptable under the Academic Honor Code, please
			speak to me, and I
			will be glad to help clarify things.  It is always easier
			to ask beforehand than to have trouble later!</p>
