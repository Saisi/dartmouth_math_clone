<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Here are
the complete answers to the pirate and sheep problems from the midterm:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Sheep:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The key to
this problem is making full use of the fact that the judge would stop whenever
he could convict or acquit anyone, and that he convicted someone after three
questions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>First, we
note that the answers to the second question could not have been “No.”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Because if the answer to the second question
were “No,” then the first two sheep must either both be speaking the truth or
both be lying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In either case, one of
them is the spy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>[Since if the first
two sheep were not the spy, one would have to lie and other would have to speak
the truth.]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since the judge did not
acquit after the second question, there must have been a possibility that the
third person was guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Hence, the
second answer must have been “yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Next we
note that the first and last sheep must answer the same, as “NYY” and “YYN,”
both allow for multiple people to be te spy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In the first case the sheep could be “Truther, Liar, Spy,” or “Spy,
Truther, Liar.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the second case the
sheep could be “Liar, Truther, Spy,” or “Spy, Liar, Truther.”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Hence the answers would be inconclusive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">            </span>Thus, the
only possibilities are “YYY” and “NYN.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In the first case, neither the first or last sheep can be the truther
(as the truth teller would never say he is the spy), hence the middle person is
telling the truth, the first lying, and the third is the spy.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the second case, neither the first or
last sheep can be the liar (who would say he is the spy).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus the middle sheep is the liar, the first
is speaking the truth and the third is a spy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">           </span>In both
cases, the third sheep is convicted as the spy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Pirates:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As was
pointed out on the handout, if there were only two pirates, the captain could
claim all the gold for himself and win the 1-1 tie vote that would occur.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus, if there were three pirates, the first
mate would never side with the captain, as he knows he will get all the gold if
he can thwart the captain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, the
second mate knows that, if the captain is thrown overboard, he would receive no
gold whatsoever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus, the captain only
needs to give one gold coin to the second mate to secure his vote, as the
second mate will get more gold this way than if he throws the Captain
overboard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Thus, with
three pirates, the captain proposes the plan of him getting 99 coins and the
second mate getting 1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This plan passes
2-1.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We can
build upwards to the case of 4 pirates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Since in the case of three pirates, the first pirate gets 99 coins and
the second mate gets 1, we see that the captain would have to give all 100
coins to the first mate if he wants his vote (otherwise the first mate, upon
becoming captain, would get 99).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>However, the captain doesn’t need the first mate’s vote, he only needs 1
other vote.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since the third mate will
become the second mate (and get 1 coin) if the Captain is thrown over, the
captain would have to give the third mate 2 coins to buy his vote.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, if the captain gets thrown over,
the second mate would become the first mate and get nothing (since the first
mate never gets anything).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus the
captain only needs to give the second mate 1 coin to get his vote.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is the cheapest possibility, so the
Captain allocates 99 for himself and 1 to the second mate.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This plan passes 2-2.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>If there
were 5 pirates, a similar analysis holds: the second mate and the fourth mate
would receive nothing if the captain is thrown overboard as they would become
the first and third mates in the 4 pirate version, and hence receive
nothing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus, it only requires a
single gold coin to get their votes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So
the Captain allocates 98 coins to himself and gives 1 coin to the second mate
and 1 to the fourth mate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This plan
passes 3-2.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This
continues up until the 30 pirate version, each time the even numbered mates
know they will receive nothing if the current captain is thrown over, so the
captain gives each of them one coin to vote for him.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>So, in the case of 30 captains the plan for allocating the booty
is 86 for the Captain and 1 for the 2<sup>nd</sup>,4<sup>th</sup>,6<sup>th</sup>,…,28<sup>th</sup>
mate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This plan passes 15-15.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>However,
evenutally we run out of coins and the problem takes on another facet.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is not as simply as “the pirates kill
each other off until there are only 202 pirates left.”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Let’s take a closer look:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When there
are 202 pirates left, the captain can save his hide by giving every other mate
a gold coin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When his own vote is
added, the plan passes 101-101.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus,
when there are 202 pirates or fewer there is no danger of anyone being thrown
over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is the first cornerstone of
the solution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This means that it will
always take at least 1 coin to buy the votes of the pirates if there are 203 or
fewer pirates, since the pirates know they can at least get the joy of throwing
someone overboard if they don’t get at least one gold coin.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since there are only 100 coins and a captain
of 203 pirates would need 101 votes (not counting his own), there is no way the
captain lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Since
anytime there are 203 pirates left,the Captain always gets thrown overboard,
the pirates know they can expect as much money as in the case with 202 pirates,
since it will reduce to that scenario when the captain is off’ed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus, the 1<sup>st</sup> mate (who will
become captain) knows he will receive no gold, but can keep his life.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The 2<sup>nd</sup> mate (who would become 1<sup>st</sup>
mate) knows he will receive no gold but keep his life.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The 3<sup>rd</sup> mate, 5<sup>th</sup>
mate, 7<sup>th</sup> mate, etc. all know they will receive 1 gold coin and all
the other mates know they will receive nothing, but all keep their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Now,
consider what occurs with 204 pirates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Since the 1<sup>st</sup> mate would become captain (and afterward fish
food) if the plan fails, the 1<sup>st</sup> mate will vote for the captain’s
plan no matter what!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus, the Captain
in the 204 pirate version gets a free vote.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>He can pay 1 gold coin to 100 of the pirates who would otherwise receive
nothing if he is thrown overboard, and this gives him enough votes (counting
his own) to keep his life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus, we see
the plan for 204 pirates would be:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>0-0-0-1-0-1-0-1-0-1-0-1-…-0-1.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the vote would be 102-102 (he would receive his own
vote, the 1<sup>st</sup> mate (who otherwise is doomed when he becomes captain)
would vote for him along with the 100 pirates who received the gold coins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>However, this
means that the Captain of a crew of 205 will be in big trouble, since the
pirates now know that 204 is a “safe” number…a number in which no one
dies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus, the pirates will once again
need to be paid at least 1 gold coin for their votes and there are not enough
gold coins to go around.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In the case
of 206 pirates, the same thing occurs, except the first mate is the “free
vote,” he will vote for the Captain no matter what.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>However, that still is not enough to save the captain’s hide,
since he could only muster 102 votes (His own, the free vote from the 1<sup>st</sup>
mate and the 100 he could buy from the other pirates).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus, with 206 pirates the captain is also
thrown overboard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Similarly
for 207, except now the captain gets 2 “free votes,” since now the first mate
and the second mate know they will die if the plan does not go through.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, these two free votes only give the
captain 103 (1 for himself, 2 free ones, and 100 to be bought with gold coins).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He needs 104 votes to live, so he dies also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Finally,
with 208 pirates the captain gets 3 free votes, since the first three mates
know they will all die if the captain’s plan does not work…thus the captain can
must 104 votes: 1 from himself, 3 free ones from the first three mates, and 100
from the gold coins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Thus we
have that 208 is another “safe number,” and the progression begins again, with
the captains dying until they get enough ‘free votes” to overcome the
sanguinity of the pirates who know they are safe [the first 208 of them].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">           </span>If we examine
the pattern of “safe numbers:” 202, 204, 208, we see that they are all “200
plus a power of 2,” so 216, 232, and 264 will all be safe numbers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, there are no safe numbers from 264
to 300.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>So, in the
case of 300 pirates, the first 36 pirates die and when there are 264 pirates
left, the captain proposes a plan where the first 32 pirates [including
himself] get nothring, but vote for the Captain anyway to preserve themselves,
and the mates numbered 66,68,70,…264 each get 1 and vote for the captain so
that the plan passes 132-132.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Note,
there is one extra subtlety, at each “safe number” the even or oddness of which
of the mates you buy with the gold changes, but that is a minor point.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Note, if
anyone had given a super-complete answer to the pirate problem, he would have
received 13 out of 10 points…A completely complete answer for the first 2 steps
garnered 8 points.</p>
