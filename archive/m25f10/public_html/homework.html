<h2>Midterm Solutions</h2>
<p>Solutions to the first two midterms are below.  They are probably not free of typos, but hopefully they are free of mathematical errors. </p>

<ul>
	<li> <a href = "homework/M25M1sol.pdf">Midterm 1 Solutions</a>.</li>
	<li> <a href = "homework/M25M2sol.pdf">Midterm 2 Solutions</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Homework Assignment List</h2>

<p>In general, homework should be turned in either in class or by 2pm the day the homework is due, at my office.  There are no guarantees that the solutions are free of typos (hopefully they are free of mathematical errors!).
