<br><br><br>

<quote> "To learn read, to think write, to master teach." </quote>

<br><br>
There will be three types of homework assigned in this course, the reason for this is to help you 
learn the material, you have to be aware that to learn mathematics you actually have to do mathematics. 
You cannot really learn just by watching me lecture. Also remember that homework is a dress rehearsal 
for the exams. 
<br><br>
For better results I recommend that you do the reading assignment first, then the practice assignment 
and finally the writting assignment. It would be great if you formed a study group so that you can teach 
someone else the material, this way you would trully master the concepts. 
<br><br>
<b>Reading Assignment: </b> What reading math? Yes, most students that are successful in mathematics 
actually read their books/notes first to understand the concepts before attempting problems. This will 
actually save you lots of time since you don't have to be guessing what the definitions are or how to solve 
the problems. Also it would acquaint you with your book and hopefully reduce the things that you have to learn 
the night before the exam. Reading the book first is a smarter way to study.
<br><br>

<b>Practice Problems: </b> This one is obvious, you have to first practice easy problems to build your confidence. 
If you cannot do these problems and you have done the reading assignment then you should come to see me. Sometimes 
you have forgotten something from some previous class and I can remind you.
<br><br>

<b>Written Assignment: </b> These problems will be a bit more challenging and will check whether you have understood 
the material, it is due once a week, however, please do not leave it until 10PM the night before it is due because 
chances are you won't be able to finish it. These problems are intended to give you a better preparation and a deeper 
understanding of what you have learned over the previous week. 
<br><br>

The following are some guidelines when preparing your written assignment:
<ul>
<li> Please buy a binder instead of a notebook for this class. It will be easier to add remove assignments and this 
way you will be more organized and you will be able to find things quicker. 
<li> <b>Late homework will not be accepted under any circumstances</b>, please do not ask for extensions. I will, however, allow 
you to drop the lowest score in the written assignments.
<li>Written homework will be assigned daily and will be collected once a week at the beginning of class.</li> 
<li>All homework assignments will be posted on the course assignments page. Click on homework on the menu on the top.
<li> Always read the feedback given on your written assignments, it will help you understand what you missed and also help you when 
you study for exams. 
<li>Late and missing papers count zero. It is your responsibility to keep track of all your papers so please make sure that 
you keep them until you know your final grade.</li><li> Homework is to be written <b>neatly</b> using both sides of
8 1/2 x 11inch paper. All papers are to be stapled.</li><li> Use <b>English</b>. If you can't read your solutions aloud as 
fluently as if you were reading a textbook, try using nouns and verbs in
your write ups!</li></ul>
If you do not follow this guidelines, your homework will be returned to you ungraded.
