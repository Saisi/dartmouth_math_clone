<b>Homework:</b>  Homework will be given every class period except Friday,
and will be due at the beginning of the following class.  <Font
Color="FF0000">Late homework is
not permitted for any reason</font>.  Your two lowest homework grades will
be
dropped to allow for missed assignments.  Expect to spend approximately 2
hours working on homework outside of class for every hour spent in
class. <a href="homework.html">Homework</a> will be listed on the course
web page.

<p>
<b>Course Web Page:</b>  The web page is located at
<a 
href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m1f01/">http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m1f01/</a> 
Alternatively, you can go to the math
department page at <a
href="../../../index.html">http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/</a>, 
click on <i>Web Pages by
Course</i>, and then click on <i>Math 1 Fall 2001</i>.  There you will
find the <a href="homework.html">homework</a> as it is assigned, <a
href="tests.html">dates of exams</a>, and a smattering of other things.

<p>
<b>Exams:</b>  There will be two exams during the quarter in addition to
one final exam.  The two exams will be held on Monday, Oct 15 and Monday,
Nov 5.  The time of the final exam will be announced at a later date.  It
is Dartmouth policy that final exams are not subject to rescheduling so
please do not make your plans to leave campus until the Registrar has
announced the schedule for finals.

<p>
<blockquote>
Hour Exam 1: Monday, October 15, 2001 - Bradley 102 at 7PM<br>	
Hour Exam 2: Monday, November 5, 2001 - Bradley 102 at 7PM<br>
Final Exam: Sunday, Dec. 9 from 4:00-6:00PM.  <br>
<br>
The location of the final exam will appear on <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/ExamSchedule01F.html">the registrar's
webpage</a> about two weeks before the end of classes. <br>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Weekly Quizzes:</b>  The last day of every week (usually a
Friday) there will be a short 10 minute quiz to make sure you've
been keeping up with the homework.  The types of problems on the quiz will
be very similar in style to those assigned in homework.  Missing class on
the day of a quiz will result in a score of zero on that quiz.  Your
lowest quiz grade will be dropped when figuring out your final grade.

<blockquote>
<p>
Quizzes will be given on Friday of each week, except for the week of
October 26.  That week the quiz will be given on Wednesday, October 24
for Section 2 and Thursday, October 25 for Section 1.
<p>
There will be no class November 22 and 23 due to Thanksgiving
break.  There will also be no quiz during that week.
<p>
Here is a list of all <a href="tests.html">quiz dates</a>.
