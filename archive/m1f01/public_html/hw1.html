<Center>Hugging the Equator </CENTER>
<BR>
Suppose that you have a rope around the
equator of a basketball and that the radius of the basketball is 6
inches. How much longer would you have to make the
rope so that it is 1 foot from the surface of the basketball at all 
points?
<BR>
<BR>
Now suppose you have the rope around the
equator of the earth. (Yes, a rope about 132,000,000 feet long!) How much
longer would you have to make the rope so that it is 1 foot off the
ground all the way around the equator? 
<BR>
<BR>
In general, if you have a sphere and a rope around the equator, how much
longer do you have to make the rope so that it is 1 foot from the surface
of the sphere?
