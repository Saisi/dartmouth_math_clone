"The main duty of the historian of mathematics, as well as his fondest
privilege, is to explain the humanity of mathematics, to illustrate its
greatness, beauty, and dignity, and to describe how the incessant efforts
and accumulated genius of many generations have built up that magnificent
monument, the object of our most legitimate pride as men, and of our
wonder, humility and thankfulness, as individuals. The study of the
history of mathematics will not make better mathematicians but gentler
ones, it will enrich their minds, mellow their hearts, and bring out their
finer qualities." <br>

The discovery of calculus is often attributed to two men, Isaac Newton and
Gottfried Leibniz, who independently developed its foundations.  Although
they both were instrumental in its creation, they thought of the
fundamental concepts in very different ways.  While Newton considered
variables changing with time, Leibniz thought of
the variables x and y as ranging over sequences of infinitely close
values. He introduced dx and
dy as differences between successive values of these sequences.  Leibniz
knew that dy/dx gives the tangent but he did not use it as a defining
property.   On the other hand, Newton used quantities x' and y', which
were finite
velocities, to compute the tangent.  Of course neither Leibniz nor Newton
thought in terms of functions, but both always thought in terms of
graphs. For Newton the calculus
was geometrical while Leibniz took it towards analysis. 

<p>

It is interesting to note that Leibniz was very conscious of the
importance of good notation and put a lot of thought into the symbols he
used.  Newton, on the other hand, wrote more for
himself than anyone else.  Consequently, he tended to use whatever
notation he thought of on that day.   This turned out to be important in
later developments.  Leibniz's notation was better suited to generalizing
calculus to multiple variables and in addition it highlighted the operator
aspect of the derivative and integral.    As a result, much of the
notation that is used in Calculus today is due to Leibniz.

<p>

The development of Calculus can roughly be described along a <a
href="timeline.html">timeline</a>
which goes through three periods: Anticipation, Development, and
Rigorization.  In the Anticipation stage techniques were being used by
mathematicians that involved infinite processes to find areas under curves
or maximaize certain quantities.  In the Development stage Newton and
Leibniz created the foundations of Calculus and brought all of these
techniques together under the umbrella of the derivative and
integral.  However, their methods were not always logically sound, and it
took mathematicians a long time during the Rigorization stage to justify
them and put Calculus on a sound mathematical foundation.

<p>

In their development of the calculus both Newton and Leibniz used
"infinitesimals", quantities that are infinitely small and yet
nonzero.  Of course, such infinitesimals do not really exist, but Newton
and Leibniz found it convenient to use these quantities in their
computations and their derivations of results.  Although one could not
argue with the success of calculus, this concept of infinitesimals
bothered mathematicians.  <a
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Berkeley.html"> 
Lord Bishop Berkeley</a> made serious criticisms of
the calculus referring to infinitesimals as "the ghosts of departed
quantities".

<p>

Berkeley's criticisms were well founded and important in that they focused
the attention of mathematicians on a logical clarification of the
calculus.   It was to be over 100 years, however, before Calculus was to
be made rigorous.  Ultimately, <a
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Cauchy.html">Cauchy</a>,
<a
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Weierstrass.html">
Weierstrass</a>, and <a
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Riemann.html">Riemann</a>
reformulated Calculus in terms of limits rather than infinitesimals.  Thus
the need for these infinitely small (and nonexistent) quantities was
removed, and replaced by a notion of quantities being "close" to
others.  The derivative and the integral were both reformulated in terms
of limits.  While it may seem like a lot of work to create rigorous
justifications of computations that seemed to work fine in the first
place,  this is an important development.  By putting Calculus on a
logical footing, mathematicians were better able to understand and extend
its results, as well as to come to terms with some of the more subtle
aspects of the theory.

<p>

When we first study Calculus we often learn its concepts in an order that
is somewhat backwards to its development.  We wish to take advantage of
the hundreds of years of thought that have gone into it.  As a result, we
often begin by learning about limits.  Afterward we define the derivative
and integral developed by Newton and Leibniz.  But unlike Newton and
Leibniz we define them in the modern way - in terms of limits.  Afterward
we see how the derivative and integral can be used to solve many of the
problems that precipitated the development of Calculus.
