This is the first time in 30 years that he has produced a new edition. We hope it will be exciting. <p>&nbsp;</p><p>The course will be arranged as follows: We expect two midterm exams (given   in &quot;Take-Home&quot; form) and a final exam, also given in &quot;Take-Home&quot;   form. There will be frequent homework assignments, but these will not count   for the grade. It is important, however, for each student to attempt the homework.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A syllabus for the course is roughly as follows. The first chapter of the book   is on set theory, but we will cover this material gradually, as it arises in   the course. The next chapter, Chapter 1, deals with Sentential Logic. We will   go through this fairly fast, omitting only sections 1.3 and 1.6. Chapter 2 is   on First-order logic, and this where we will spend most of out time. We do not   expect to cover 2.3, and we may well add some material on the right way to approach   calculus, We may also find some further applications of the logic presented   in the text.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 align="center">Instructor: Jim Baumgartner</h3><h3 align="center">Time: Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays 8:45 - 9:50</h3><h3 align="center">Room: 103 Bradley</h3><p align="center">The room is air-conditioned, and sometimes this may make it   rather cold.
