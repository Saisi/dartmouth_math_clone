Imagine what your instructor would think of you if you were to say,
<!-- that you were
a whiner if you said,--> 
"I want more points," or
"Oh my God, that's so unfair!" 
To avoid creating this negative impression, try to present yourself as a 
student who is 
interested in <em> concepts </em> and nothing else.<BR>
<BR>
1. Tell your instructor, "I have a question about a concept on
the exam.  I don't want any more points or anything."  Point to the
misgraded question and ask, "What concept am I missing here?"<BR>
<BR>
2. If the instructor points out a really minor error, say,
"Oh, is that it?  I was afraid it was a bigger mistake."<BR>
<BR>
3. If the instructor starts to feel guilty and offers  
you more points, say, "Oh, that's OK.  You don't have to."<BR>
<BR>
4. If the instructor insists, then you can surrender saying,
"Well, if you insist."<BR>
