<p> Our final exam will be 8 - 11 AM on Friday, June 3
in our classroom.<br>
It will be cumulative over the course, with roughly a uniform
distribution of material.  The length will be longer than
the midterms, but not twice as long.<br>
A good way to study is to go over old homework and test problems,
including looking at the handouts for problems that confuse you.
In addition, try looking at odd-numbered problems in the book
that were not assigned.  In general, it is good to know why
things are true, not just that they are true.  This helps for
remembering both short and long term.  Finally, studying in a group is fine,
but you should also do some on your own.  It may be easy to fool
yourself that you understand something when you're with others
who may understand it better than you do.<br>
Good luck!

			place a relatively small number of students on
			borderlines.  At the end of the term, the lowest of
			your 4 grades (hw, midterms, final) will be dropped,
			except if your final exam is your lowest grade, in which
			case the weight of the final exam will be halved.  (So,
			if one of the midterms or hw is dropped, then the remaining
			3 grades have weights 25, 25, 50; while if the final is the
			lowest, the four grades have equal weight 25, 25, 25, 25.)</p>

Homework due <b>FRIDAY</b>, May 27:<br>
Section 10.2, number 2.<br>
Section 11.1, numbers 2, 6 (interpret w^(n) as u^(n) as in Theorem 11.2)<br>
Section 11.2, numbers 4, 6, 8.
</p>
<p> Homework due Monday, May 23:<br>
Section 10.1, numbers 2, 8.
<p>
Homework due Monday, May 16:<br>
Section 9.1, numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14.
</p>
<p>
Homework due Monday, May 9:<br>
Section 6.2, any 10 problems from numbers 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 22, 24, 28, 30.<br>
(Do all 11 for extra credit.)  Some students tell me that there is no number
30 in their texts for section 6.2.  I believe in this case you should do
number 29 instead: Compute the variance for the Poisson random variable
with parameter &lambda and show that it is &lambda .<br>
Section 7.1, number 2. (If you did number 4, as posted earlier, hand it in
separately for extra credit.)<br>
Section 8.1, numbers 8, 14. (For number 14, use the same method of proof as we
did for Chebyshev's inequality.)
</p>
<p>
		  Homework due Monday, May 2:<br>
		  Section 6.1, numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 18,
		  30 a,c,d, 40.
		  </p>
		  <p> Homework due Monday, April 25:<br>

		  Homework due Monday, April 18: <br>
		  Section 4.1, numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16, 22, 26, 34, 36, 38.<br>
		  Extra problem:  I have a secret integer that I've chosen randomly
		  between one and one million (inclusive).  One million people independently
		  try to guess my number.  What is the probability that at least one
		  person will guess right?  What is the conditional probability that
		  at least two people guess right, given that at least one person guesses
		  right?
		  </p>

		  <p>Homework due Monday, April 11:<br>
		  Sec. 3.1, numbers 4, 6, 12.<br>

		  </p>
<p>
Homework due Monday, April 4:<br>
Sec. 1.1, #14, #16. (By "simulate", the book means to try out some cases,
perhaps by a computer program, perhaps just by thinking hard!  These
questions are not cookie-cutter, and are designed to have you think about
some interesting issues.  We'll learn precise tools to deal with this
type of question later in the course.)<br>

			<p style="text-align : justify"> Students are encouraged

			homework problems, and not how that is achieved. The honor
			principle applies to homework in the following way. <span
			style="color:#CC0000; font-weight:bold">What a student
			turns in as a homework solution is to be his or her own
			understanding of how to do the problem. Students must
			state what sources they have consulted, with whom they
			have collaborated, and from whom they have received
			help.</span> Students are discouraged from using solutions
			to problems that may be posted on the web for previous
			offerings of the course, and as just stated, must
			reference them if they use them. The solutions you submit
			must be written by you alone.  Any copying (electronic or
			otherwise) of anotehr person's code or solutions, in whole
			or in part, is a violation of the Honor Code.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align : justify">The honor principle
			applies to exams as follows:<span style="color: #CC0000">
			<b> Students may not give or receive assistance of any
			kind on an exam from any person except the professor
			or someone explicitly designated by the professor to
			answer questions about the exam. </span></b>Students may not use

			to help with simple arithmetic.
