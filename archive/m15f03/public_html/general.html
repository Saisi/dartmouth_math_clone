Attendance to scheduled classes is expected.  If you miss class, you will miss information and lose the chance to try problems similar to those that will appear on examinations.  If an emergency arises, pleasemake arrangements to obtain notes from a classmate and to go over them with a friend or the teaching assistant.<br> <br>Learning Disabilities or other handicaps.  If you have a special circumstance that would require you to have extra time on examinations or any other unusual needs, please have the Academic Skills Center provide documentationto your IMPS instructor, well before the first examination.<br> <br> The Honor Principle for IMPS.  In this class the honor principle means "no help given or received" on examinations.Homework is meant to be a collaborative effort, but in IMPS you must write up solutions yourself unless you are explicitlyasked to do otherwise.  You may not have a friend  write up your homework nor may you submit a photocopy.<br><br>Homework Policy.  Written homework is due the day indicated, before the start of class.  WebWork problems have a closingdate and time posted on the WebWork page.  After the time indicated it is not possible to submit solutions to homeworkproblems for credit.  We will have both types of homework in Math 15.1. <br> <br>A little history of this course.  IMPS stands for "Integrated Mathematics and Physical Science" and was originally taught asan interdisciplinary course with the Physics and Chemistry Departments.  The original IMPS no longer exists, but we in theMath Department think it was such a good idea that we keep our half of it going.  The text notes, by Marcia Groszek and DeloMook, contribute to the interdisciplinary feel of the course.  If you read the parts of them that explain the physics youare seeing in Physics 13, you will get an idea of what it would be like to take the original IMPS.  Is an interdisciplinaryapproach to calculus harder?  Yes, but it is worth it, because when you go to solve a real life physics or engineeringproblem, the math won't be sealed off in a corner of your brain.  It will be connected to all the physics you are learningthis quarter.</b> <tr> <td bgcolor="#004000" height=36 align=left> <a class=large href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/"> Dartmouth <a> </td> <td bgcolor="AACCAA" height=36 align=left> <a> This page was last updated on August 29, 2003 by <a><a href="mailto:dorothy.wallace@dartmouth.edu"> Dorothy Wallace</a><a>. </a> </td> </tr></table> </html>
