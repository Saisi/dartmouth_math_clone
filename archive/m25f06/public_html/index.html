<LI><FONT color=red>BUILDING NOTICE:</FONT> Due to the nearing completion of the Kemeny/Haldeman building, there will be numerous changes occurring during fall term that will affect the day-to-day workings of this course. First among these is our assigned classroom. Current building schedules anticipate that we will meet in a Bradley/Gerry classroom (as yet unassigned) through the end of October. At that point, we will move into a Kemeny classroom. Secondly, my office will move from 1-S Bradley Hall (in the basement) to 243 Kemeny Hall (2nd floor). This move will occur somewhat earlier, at the end of September. I will provide updates and details as I hear them.
