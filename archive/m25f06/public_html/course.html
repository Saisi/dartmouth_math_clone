<U><B><FONT color=A52A2A>Course Description</FONT></B></U>

<BR><BR>
From the ORC:

<UL>
<I>This course is a survey of the elementary arithmetic of the integers (prime numbers, factorization, congruences, diophantine equations) with some historical study of important problems.</I>
</UL>

In particular, we will spend the majority of the term on the following topics:
<UL>
<LI>Primes and Divisibility
<LI>Congruences and Their Applications
<LI>Arithmetic Functions
<LI>Cryptology Topics
<LI>Quadratic Residues
</UL>
We will also make the occasional foray into selected historical topics and settings in number theory.

<!-- HOMEWORK POLICY -->

<BR><HR><A name=homework>
<U><B><FONT color=A52A2A>Homework Policy</FONT></B></U>

<BR><BR>

Homework will be assigned weekly, and will be due each Wednesday at the <B>beginning</B> of class. 

<BR><BR>

Homework Policies:
<UL>
<LI>Late homework will not be accepted in the absense of divine intervention or matters of similar weight; unexcused late and missing papers count zero. 
<LI>Homework is to be written neatly using only one side of each page of paper. 
<LI>Do not use paper from a spiral notebook unless you can tear off the ragged edge. 
<LI>All pages of an assignment are to be stapled or paper-clipped together.
</UL>

Some Advice:
<UL>
<LI>Write your name on each assignment. This probably sounds obvious, but is sometimes easy to forget.
<LI>Label the problems. Each problem should be numbered, and its page number indicated. Also, make sure your handwriting is legible; if I can't read your solution, I can't give you credit.
<LI>Make sure to show all work for each problem, whether you complete it or not. (Translation: the more work you show, the better.)
<LI>However: you do not need to show calculator- or computer-based computations; you need only explain what the inputs and outputs are, and how it fits into your solution.
<LI>If you have a question about the homework, feel free to e-mail me, visit during office hours, or make an appointment.
<LI>Write in complete sentences. You should be able to read your solutions as fluently as if you were reading your textbook.
</UL>

<!-- GRADING -->

<BR><HR><A name=grading>
<U><B><FONT color=A52A2A>Grading</FONT></B></U>
<BR><BR>

The course grade will be based upon scores on the homework, two midterm exams and the final exam.

<UL>

    <th>Midterm Exams</th>

</TABLE>
</UL>

<!-- EXAMINATIONS -->

<BR><HR><A name=exams>
<U><B><FONT color=A52A2A>Examinations</FONT></B></U>

<BR><BR>
As described above, there will be two midterm exams worth 100 points each, and a final exam worth 150 points. All exams will likely be given as take-home exams, though I reserve the right to make changes to this policy. The exams are (tentatively) scheduled as follows.
<BR>

<UL>

    <th>Final Exam</th>
    <TD>December 2, 2006, 3:00-6:00pm</TD>
  </tr>
</TABLE>
</UL>

Some things to note:
<UL>
<LI>Exams <B><FONT color="red">will not</FONT></B> be given early to accommodate travel plans.	
<LI>The final exam time given above is the one scheduled by the Registrar's Office; 
any take-home final will be scheduled according to college regulations. 
</UL>

<!-- HONOR PRINCIPLE -->

<BR><HR><A name=honor>
<U><B><FONT color=A52A2A>Honor Principle</FONT></B></U>

<BR><BR>
<B>On Exams and/or Quizzes</B>: No help can be given or received. No calculators are allowed.
<BR><BR>
<B>On Homework</B>: Working together is permitted and encouraged, but <B>NO COPYING</B>. 
You are welcome to work in groups to discuss the ideas and specific problems 
(also feel free to discuss with your instructor, tutors, and anyone else you may find). 
However, each student is expected to produce the final written homework set individually 
and independently. 
<BR><BR>
Any violation of the Honor Principle will be addressed according to Dartmouth College guidelines.
<BR>

<!-- SPECIAL NEEDS -->

<BR><HR><A name=needs>
<U><B><FONT color=A52A2A>Special Needs</FONT></B></U>

<BR><BR>
Students with special needs who will be taking this course and may need disability-related 
classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an appointment to see their instructor as 
soon as possible, certainly within the first two weeks of the course. Also, they should 
stop by the <A href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/admin/acskills/">Academic Skills Center</A>
in Collis Center to register for support services.
