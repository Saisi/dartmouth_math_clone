<li> Oct 11 2010: Math 8 Fall 2009's first midterm is available <a href="m8f09m1.pdf">here</a>.  The solutions are available <a href = "http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m8f10/m8f09m1sol.pdf">here</a>.  Some of the topics on that year's midterm will not be on the midterm tomorrow, and that exam is missing some topics which will be on the midterm tomorrow (integral test and comparison tests).  You might also be able to find midterms from other Math 8 classes by browsing the <a href="../../../courses/by-course/index.html">list of Math 8 websites</a> maintained by the Dartmouth math department.  </li>
<li> Oct 11 2010: The first midterm will be in the Cook Auditorium at Murdough Center.  </li>

<li> Oct 1 2010: You can sign up for Math 8 <a href="http://studygroups.dartmouth.edu">study groups</a>.  You will need to logon with your Dartmouth ID and then look for Math 8 study groups.  There is also a small fee.  You can find more information about study groups at the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/tutors/join.html">Academic Skills Center</a> website.  This service is not provided through the math department, so we cannot provide direct support for signing up in study groups. </li>
