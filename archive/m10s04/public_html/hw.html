<h2>Math 10  Log</h2>
<hr>
<b> Week 1 (March 29-April 2) :</b>

<p>
Monday: (Read  Chapter 1,  problems: All.) Welcome <a 
HREF="Math10Rand31.html"> Class
</a>.  
<a
HREF="http://www.washington.edu/newsroom/news/2003archive/10-03archive/k102003.html">Observational
</a>  verses
randomized controlled experiments (see  <a
HREF=
"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/">
also
</a>).
(Explanation: The problems listed are those related to THAT day's lecture.  
When possible looking over this material before the class when it is being 
covered will be   EXTREMELY helpful to your understanding of the material.  
However, the problems are only in  due in  the sense of being a part of 
the Friday quiz.  The Friday quizzes will always cover the problems 
assigned during the week's lectures.  (More precisely: the problems 
assigned on the previous week's Friday, and the current week's Monday and 
Wednesday. )  The entire set of problems will always be posted by Monday 
morning, giving you an entire week to work on them.  Each Thursday evening 
our TA  (Francois) will run a help session to help you with the assigned 
problems. 
)
<p>
Wednesday: (Read Chapter 2, problems: All
except review). Will will run a randomized, 
controlled, double blind 
experiment. Here's another example of something that is  <a
HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/28/magazine/28MADCOW.html?ex=1081660477&ei=1&en=a9d841c964867f91">
not</a>. 
If there is 
time we will plug our data into Stata.
Stata is a key served statistics program available to Dartmouth student 
(<a 
HREF="http://www.dartmouth.edu/comp/resources/downloads/mac/academic/index.html"> 
Mac
</a>, <a 
HREF="http://www.dartmouth.edu/comp/resources/downloads/win/academic/index.html"> 
Windows
</a>).  If you are having trouble in stalling it please contact the 
Dartmouth <a HREF="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~comp/support/"> help desk
</a>.  One nice thing about Stata is that it is supported at Dartmouth 
(for <a HREF="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~rc/stat/stats/stat10.html"> 
example
</a>) and is also  some <p><center>
<a 
HREF="http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/"> Excellent Stata Support 
</a>
</center> <p>  available on the web.  Also Stata (or very similar programs 
like SAS) 
are  the types of statistical tools you are likely to use if do a serious 
statistical project in academics or in industry.   
Here is our
