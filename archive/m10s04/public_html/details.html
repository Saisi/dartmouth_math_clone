<h2>Math 10 (Introductory Statistics) - Spring  
2004</h2>

<p>
<b> Text: </b> <IT> Statistics  </IT>,   Third edition, by Freedman 
Pisani, and Purves (W. W. Norton & C0. ISBN 0-393-97083-3).

<p>
  <b>Grade</b>: Your 
grade will be determined as follows: 
a midterm exam  (20% of your grade),  
a short project  (20% of your grade), weekly quizzes (20% of your grade),  
and a final exam (the remaining  40% of your grade).  

<p>
<b>Class Log:</b>   The homework assignments and exam  dates   can be 
found in the 
class <a href="hw.html"> log.</a>  Each Friday's class will usually 
include a quiz 
based VERY closely on the assigned homework martial.
<p>

<b>Honor 
Principle</b>: 
On the exams and quizzes, no help is to be given or received.
While working on the short project you may use any references you'd like 
under the condition that you always carefully reference your sources. 
Also,
collaboration is encouraged during the process of thinking about and 
collecting data for your project, but every non-referenced aspect of your 
final write up must be entirely in your own words. 

<p>

<b>Students with disabilities</b>:  I encourage students with
disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases and 
learning disabilities, to discuss  with me any
appropriate accommodations that 
might be helpful.
<p>

<b> Recitation session </b>: Every Thursday from 7:00-9:00 our TA 
<a HREF="../../../~dorais/index.html">Francois G. Dorais </a> 
will be running a recitation session.   (Recall every Friday there is a 
quiz.) 


<p>
<b>X-Session</b>: We will missing two class days (Monday April 25th and 
Monday May 24th). We will be making this up with 3 X-Sessions, on 
Thursday
April 1, Thursday
April 8, and Thursday
April 15.  
<p>

<b>Syllabus</b>: In this course we will cover the three basic tools of the 
statistical trade: 
descriptive statistics, probability, and inference. First  we will cover  
various topics in descriptive statistics, including a look at correlation 
and the regression line.  Next we will familiarize ourselves with various   
probability ideas, including the understanding of discrete distributions 
and the central limit theorem.  Lastly, we  will put our first two topics 
together 
and discuss inferential statistics, including a discussion of 
confidence intervals and a variety of hypothesis tests.   
We will essentially be covering <b> all </b> of the text, hence our text's 
<a 
href="http://btobsearch.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?sourceid=00395996645644787198&btob=Y&ean=9780393970838&pwb=1&displayonly=TOC">table 
of contents<a> can be used as a more detailed syllabus (More precisely we 
will definitely cover chapters 1-6,8-10,13-21,23,26-29.  Some of the more 
interesting material is in the left over chapters, which we will cover if 
time permits.).  I feel this text is fabulous, but it gives very little
 discussion of how to organize 
and  manipulate large data sets. We  will be learning this topic 
independently  of the text, and, in particular, we  will learn to use Stata.
