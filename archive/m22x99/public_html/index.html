<B>Exam dates have been set. Hour exams are July 22 and August 12 at 7
pm in Room 102 Bradley (note this is not our classroom). Ample time
will be allowed, but please be there by 7pm. </B>
<br>There are <a href="M22THans.pdf">answers </a> for the first hour exam.

<HR><B>Homework:  </B>Our homework grader is Robert Hardage.  He has
been asked to grade each set on a basis of two points each.
Essentially correct work rates 2, incorrect work rates 0, and
something in between rates 1.  Homework does not count for the final
grade unless you end between two grades. Then homework will move you
to one or the other. Do the homework even though it may not count for
the final grade! There is ample evidence to show that those who do
badly on the homework also do badly on the final grade.
