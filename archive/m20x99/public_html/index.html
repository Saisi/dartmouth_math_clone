<HR><H3><B>The hour exams have been changed.  The first will be given
out at the end of class Friday, July 23, and will be due at the
beginning of class Monday, July 26.  The second will be the same
beginning August 13.</B></h3>
<br> The <a href="M20THans.pdf">answers </a>to the first hour exam are here.

<B>Homework:</B> Our homework grader is Amanda Roberts.  She has been
asked to grade each set on a basis of two points each.  Essentially
correct work rates 2,
incorrect work rates 0, and something in between rates 1.  Homework
does not count for the final grade unless you end between two grades.
Then homework will move you to one or the other.  Do the homework even
though it may not count for the final grade! There is ample evidence
to show that those who do badly on the homework also do badly on the
final grade.
