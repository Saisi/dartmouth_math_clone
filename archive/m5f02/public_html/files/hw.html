<hr><b> Week 2:</b><p>Our first assignment  <ahref="assignment1.html">assignment</a> is due this  Friday, October 4.   On Monday October 7 we will have our first quiz.  The quiz will consist of 2 or 3 <bf> slightly </bf> modified problems form either the  the completion questions or the  multiple choice questions 1-18 from chapter 7 of our text.  Please read chapter 8 of the text before Monday as well to familiarize yourself  with next batch of concepts that we will encounter (<bf> Warning: </bf> chapter 8 is much shorter than chapter 7 and we may have a quiz based on  the material in chapter 8 as soon as Friday October 11.)   Also please go to the <ahref="http://www.gallup.com/">gallup  </a> and find and read their <ahref="http://www.gallup.com/help/FAQs/poll1.asp">  explanation </a>  of how polls are  conducted.Also <ahref="http://www.skeptics.ca/articles/odds.html">  this </a>  is a very nice account of Eric McMillan's  experience with the birthday problem and coincidences (thanks Barbara!).

<b>Week 3:</b></p><p>
Our second individual 
project explores issues involved in conducting random   surveys. You will be asked to think about how to design 
a method that will maximize   the randomness of the people you poll, 
and compute the margin of error built   in to your poll. 
<a href="assignment2.html">Here</a>   
is the description of the second project. 
It is due at the start of class on   Friday, October 18. 
(Note: a first draft is not mandatory for this project,   although we will be happy to look at any rough drafts handed in before Wednesday,   Oct. 16.) 
There will be a quiz on Chapter 8 of the text on 
Monday Oct. 14.
The quiz will consist of three slightly modified  questions from chapter 8  
chosen from  the true false 
questions, the completion questions or the following multiple-choice 
questions:  1-4,11-16 and 22-24.  As we did last week, at 
X-session 
we will  answer any  questions you may have about chapter 8.

<b>Week 4:</b>
<p>
Nancy Brand has kindly allowed us to post the <a 
href="pt1emailDartmouth.htm">
slides</a> 
from last Friday's  lecture
on an OVERVIEW of COLLEGE STUDENT DRINKING.  
In particular, you can explore the section on statistical inference.
Recall our second individual project is due this Friday. Please read 
chapters  9 and 10 on the normal curve and the central limit theorem. 
There will be 
a quiz on Friday October 25 
that will include slightly modified problems selected from 1-20 of  the 
Multiple-Choice 
Questions from chapter 9 and 10-29 of the Multiple-Choice
Questions from chapter 10.  
We  will hold a question and answer session concerning these problems 
during X-session on Thursday October 24.  On Friday we began thinking 
about <a
href="http://www.roulette-gambling.com/roulette_rules.html">
roulette </a>.  Here is part of a 
<a
href="ellis.htm">
dialog </a>  between 
professor Leibon and
gaming expert <a
href="http://www.gamble2win.com/thebiglie.htm">  R. D. Ellison </a>. 



<hr>
<b>Week 5:</b>
<p>
On Monday we discussed a little bit about roulette <a
href="system.html">
systems  </a> and the following (removed by next class) 
<a
href="editorial.pdf">
editorial   </a>,  <a
href="operation.vs.ww.pdf">
article 1   </a>, and  <a
href="QualityOfLive.pdf">
article  2  </a>. On Friday we handed out the instructions regarding 
the third project. 


<hr>
<b>Week 6:</b>
<p>
Read chapters 11 and 12. There will be quiz next Monday (November 4th) 
that covers the multiple-choice questions 41-52 of chapter 12.    
At X-session THIS WEEK we will discuss these problems.  These problems 
concern testing a 
hypothesis , as we did 
with our cookie data on Monday.     
We explored the role of the central limit theorem in utilizing this 
hypothesis test by   <a
href="../temps/Hypoth1.html">
constructing </a> data with a  random number generator.  While this 
is somewhat convincing, one might try and use a 
<a href="http://lavarand.com/">
Lava Lamp </a> or some other real random number producing device to 
produce  REAL random  numbers.  At this <a
href="http://random.org/">
random  </a> web you can down load (or have produced right in front of 
your  eyes!)  loads of random data. Here is an  <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m5f02/temps/randomHT00">
example  </a> of 100,000 
fair "head/tail" trials taken from this sight.    
With this actual data we can  <a
href="../temps/RealData00.html">
witness  </a> the central limit theorem, for real! (A special thanks goes 
to Peter Kostelec for helping me organize this data.  In fact (thanks to 
Peter) I have 8,388,608 REAL head tails experiments available in a format 
that I can really use.  If any one needs "some" data for their chance 
project,  just ask!)

<b>Week 7:</b>
<p>
Read chapters 14 and chapter 5. There will be quiz next Friday 
(November  15 th) that covers the multiple-choice questions of chapter 14.  
Your third individual project is due this Friday at the beginning 
of lecture. Notice, we  have a guest speaker during lecture this Friday 
and next 
Monday. Attendance at these lectures is required.  In class we have been 
looking  at the 
<a
href="../temps/ChiSquaredTest1.html"> 
chi-squared </a> test and have experimentally tested its <a
href="../temps/ChiSquareExplore1.html">
validity  </a>.

<b>Week 8:</b>
<p>
We  have a guest speaker during lecture this Monday
and on Thursday  evening (November 14, 7:00 P.M., Filene auditorium, Moore 
Hall) .  Attendance at these lectures is required.  Recall there is a quiz 
on the chi-squared test this Friday (this Thursday's X-session will be a 
chi-squared question and answer period).   In class, we ran a hypothesis 
test based upon "human constructed" coin flips and real ones. We 
constructed  35 examples of such data and  ran  a simple 
test in order to distinguish the two possibilities.  This test 
correctly distinguished  32 of the 35 pieces example data.  The test was 
devised  based on  the following (experimentally determined) histogram of 
maximum streak lengths. On Wednesday, we will discuss this situation in 
detail.

<H1> Project and presentation madness time!  
 Now that it is project time, we be communicating with you through e-mail, 
hence 
the homework  log is not so important.  We will be posting any 
postable  projects in order to help you with your <a
