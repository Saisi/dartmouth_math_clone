Final Assingment
</H1>
</CENTER>

Imagine our chance presentations were a part of a conference on 
"interesting topics."    The conference proceedings (the chance project 
write-ups) will be published, together with a collection of letters to the 
editor.  You are asked to submit such a letter. In this letter you should 
take one of the topics discussed at the "conference"  and produce either a 
constructive criticism or elaborate on an idea about how to improve the 
study that was discussed.   You may want to tackle questions like: Was the 
data collected legitimately? Did they collect the right data to test what 
they were interested in studying? Was the statistical test that they 
applied appropriate for this data? Would you accept their conclusions, 
even if they were contrary to your previous beliefs? Please carefully 
justify your point of view.
<p>
This letter to the editor should be about two pages long and is due by 5 
PM on Wednesday, December 11. (You may also turn it any time before then!) 
Turn it in to my mailbox in the mailroom on the third floor of Bradley. If 
that room is locked, you may slide it under the door of my office, Bradley 
412.
