During this course you will <b> need </b> to be able to utilize 
some sort of data analysis program. Microsoft's Excel program is a common 
choice and one that  the instructors can give support to.  It is available 
on public by going to 
"Licensed Software", then "KeyServer Controlled Software", the "Full 
Support", then "Excel 4.0". This folder contains both the programs and 
sundry useful material.  If you are having trouble loading 
this program, using public, or using Excel there are  various   
forms of  <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~helpdesk/"> help  </a>   
available to you.
For 
more sophisticated 
computational needs we will utilize the Maple computer program. 
Maple is also available on public. 
Here is some help regarding down loading Maple 7 to a 
<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/software/maple7-mac.html"> Mac </a>
and here is some help for loading it onto a 
<a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/software/maple-pc.html"> PC </a>.
<p>
You will also need to be able to use various databases to retrieve 
information and statistics.  The college pays BIG BUCKS so that you have 
access to many 
<a 
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/infosys/dciswww/prod/by-name.shtml"
> digital  </a> data collection.   If you are having problems accessing 
these collections then 
<a 
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/infosys/dciswww/dcishelp.shtml#Opening_a_Database"
> help  </a> is available.

Here the maple template we utilized in class in order to generate random 
students and make random  <a
href="../temps/RandomStudent1.html">  
groups </a>.  When it come time to create groups for you final project a 
possible (albeit somewhat bizarre) method might be  to 
randomly contact a few people!

Here is a program that computes the probability of a <a
href="../temps/BirthdayCoincidence1.html"> 
coincident </a> "birthday", 
utilizing the formula from class.
Here is a program that compute these probabilities utilizing the
<a
href="../temps/RuwanApproach1.html">  
Kiringoda </a>
recursion formula.

Here is a program that will help us explore the meaning of our cookie   <a
href="../temps/Hypoth1.html">
hypothesis </a> test.  To be more specific, with this program  we can 
explore our  claim that the statistic of interest is indeed normal under 
the  assumption of the null hypothesis that the probabilities are 
indistinguishable.

<p>
Here is a <b> CRUCIAL </b> program that will allow us to make nice 
  <a

histograms </a>.  <b>Warning:</b> Sometimes the  programs below will 
utilize this  program.

Here have program to implement the 
chi-squared test for <a

likeness </a>  to fit, without needing a table. 
Here have program to implement the
chi-squared test for <a
href="../temps/Independence1.html">
independence </a>. Here we have 
experimentally tested the chi-square test's  <a
href="../temps/ChiSquareExplore1.html">
validity  </a>.

Here we have program to examine the nature of a 
<a
href="../temps/Streak1.html">
streak </a>.  The figure below is an experimentally produced histogram of 
the longest streak in 200 flips of a fair coin. Notice, the expected 
longest  streak  
is nearly 8.

Here we examine three nice streak games

one  </a>,<a

two   </a> and <a

St. Petersburg Paradox </a>.
To compute the actual expected values you can <a

Here is a program that will allow us to make nice that allows you to 
explore 
  <a

<a

<a
href="http://gauss.dartmouth.edu/~m5f02/temps/HypothRegress1.html"> 
 hypothesis </a> that their exist a 
correlation.
