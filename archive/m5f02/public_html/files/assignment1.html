Write   a short (1-2 page, typed, double-spaced) description of what it means for events   to be independent of each other, and how this is represented in a mathematical   probability model. Discuss an example from either of the articles, the deaths   of the scientists in the first, or the random number generators in the second,   with respect to the framework you have already explained.</font></p><p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Then find some other instance of potential   randomness. This could be in a sports, health, or political section of a newspaper,   in a magazine, or in any other source you can produce (e.g., the transcript   of a news show). What is important is that someone is making a claim about seemingly   connected events being really independent or vice versa. Discuss the merits   of this claim, and explain what you think is the corresponding correct mathematical   model, and why. This part of the assignment is open-ended; pick something that   interests you, and persuade us that your point view is the correct one. (A minimum length for this section is 1-2 pages. You do not have to condense your analysis to fit this length, however. We care about quality, not length.)
Please include  copies of your source articles (if possible).
