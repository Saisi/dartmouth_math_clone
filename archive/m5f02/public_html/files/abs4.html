Did Casanova practice risky sex? What did "Powerball" have to do with the 
Fall of the Bastille? Just how risk-adverse was Robespierre? How did the 
sans-culottes lose their culottes? In the eighteenth century in France, 
citizens and royalty faced a multitude of risks, from sexually transmitted 
disease to decapitation. An unusual data source on the French Lottery 
provides a window on how financial risk was addressed in that tumultuous 
time, and how the emerging calculus of probabilities affected its 
perception. The story involves an unusually diverse cast of characters, 
including Casanova and Bonaparte, as well as some modern statistical 
technique, including Aldous's Poisson Heuristic.
