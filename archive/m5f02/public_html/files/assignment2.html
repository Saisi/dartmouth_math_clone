Our primary goal is to familiarize ourselves with some of the issues     involved in conducting legitimate surveys. We will imagine that you are polling     the Dartmouth student population about an issue relevant to you. Your goal     is to design an &#147;M&amp;M&#148; style survey for implementation on real     people. This can be quite complicated! In class we handed out information     that dealt with some of these complications; also read the <a href="http://www.amstat.org/sections/srms/whatsurvey.html">discussion     of polling issues</a> at the American Statistical Association website. </font></p>  <p align="left"><font size="4">For the written part of the assignment, please     do the following:<br>    <br>    1. Think of a topic on which the opinions of others genuinely interests you,     and design a survey that attempts to capture this information. <br>    <br>    2. Design two methods for choosing a random sample of Dartmouth students.     Explore and articulate whether you feel there is any natural bias built into     either of your survey methods. If so, decide whether the methods of weighting,     clustering, or stratification (all found in the above general references)     might help improve your findings. Explain why they might help.<br>    <br>    3. Decide how many students you will survey and explain why you chose this     number. Compute the margin of error associated to this sample size and explain     what a margin of error means in general, and with respect to your results.     </font></p>  <p align="left"><font size="4">Contrary to the original statement on the class     schedule, a first draft of this assignment is not due. However, we will be     happy to look at first drafts submitted before Wednesday.</font></p>  <p align="left"><font size="4">The finished assignment is due at the start of     class on Friday, October 18.</font> </p></div><p align="left"><font size="4">Please write to one of us, talk to us after class,   or come to our office hours if you have questions. </font></p></body></html>
