<!-- Course Description -->
<br>
We live in a multidimensional universe and most of the processes we encounter depend on more than one thing.
Vector Calculus generalizes the tools we found useful in one dimensional calculus to these situation and provides some new tools as well.
This course is a continuation of Math 9 and is intended for students who want to explore Vector Calculus more thoroughly than a usual multivariable Calculus course.
Topics include but are not limited to velocity, acceleration, arclength, curvature, intergrals over surfaces, vector fields and Stokes' Theorem.

Published by W. H. Freeman and Company</td></tr></table><br>

The textbook will be available at Wheelock Books.  This book is written at a slightly higher level than Stewart's <i>Calculus</i>,
so I thought it would be more appropriate for an honors level class.  It also has some fun historical notes about the developement of vector calculus for you to enjoy!<br><br>

<!-- Homework policy -->
<br>
Written Homework will be assigned for each class period and will be <font color=red>due on Thursday at the begining of x-hour</font>. 
All homework will be posted on the course <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~blackboard/new_bb61_index.php">blackboard page</a> under homework assignments.  
<br><br>
Written homework should be neat, written legibly on 8.5 by 11 inch paper, stapled with your name written in the top right corner of the top page.  
You are required to write this problem up as formally as possible. The emphasis is on the process of going from the beginning of a problem to the final solution.
 If you just submit an answer, this is worth no credit. 
We will discuss the standards for this problem in class, but there are some things to keep in mind. 
You may adopt your own style; however, all good problem writeups have several things in common. 
They always start with givens and things that are known to be true.
 They then proceed very methodically and <b>neatly</b> through a series of <b>justified</b> statements to eventually arrive at the conclusion.
 Some students may wish to write complete sentences to justify going from one statement to the next while others will wish to focus more on the math; this choice is up to you so long as exactly what is happening is clear.
 After reading a problem writeup, the reader should be left with both an understanding of how to solve the problem and the inescapable conclusion that it has been solved correctly.
In general it should be presented in such a way that you wouldn't be embarrassed to hand it to your boss and he/she would be able to follow your logic completely.
<big><font color=red>LATE HOMEWORK WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED</font></big><br><br>
I will pick some of the problems to grade based on your written work.  These will be graded on style as well as content and will be awarded up to 10 points.
10 points will be only given to those papers I consider perfect.  
<br><br>
Other problems I will grade based on presentations.  X-hours will be reserved for students to present solutions to homework problems.  
Students can either choose to present problems in x-hour or in my office.   We will discuss each presentation and how to improve upon it<font color=#ff9900> (and what went well too!)</font>.
Presentations will also be graded both on style and content.

<B>On Homework</B>:  Collaboration with your classmates on homework is highly
encouraged; that is, it's a great idea to talk about the homework problems

If you consult any person or source other than the course
textbook, your classmates, your class notes, or myself, you must acknowledge the
