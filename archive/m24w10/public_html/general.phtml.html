<p>

Linear algebra, the study of abstract vector spaces, is a beautiful subject in its own right.  It also has applications in many areas, including but not limited to mathematics, physical and biological science, and economics.

<p>  

This course differs from Math 22, Linear Algebra with Applications, in putting less emphasis on specific applications and more emphasis on mathematical abstraction and theory.  In addition to learning linear algebra, students will develop their skills in reading mathematics and in writing proofs.
<p> Prerequisite for this course:  Math 8 or the equivalent.  If you are not sure about your preparation for an honors course, please see Professor Groszek.<p>Math 24 covers much of the same material as Math 22, and can substitute for Math 22 as a prerequisite for any course, major, or minor.

We will use the x-hour at various times during the term; be sure to keep it open.  In particular, we will meet during the x-hour the first week of class (January 7), the third week of class (January 21) to replace class on Martin Luther King Jr. Day (January 18) when we will not meet, and the sixth week of class (Febraury 11) to replace class on Winter Carnival (February 12) when we will not meet.

<p>

Assigned reading is due the next class day.  Assigned written homework is due at the beginning of the first class of the following week, generally Monday.

<p>

Quizzes will generally be on Mondays.  The take-home midterm, covering Chapters 1 and 2, will be distributed on Wednesday, February 3, and will be due on Thursday, February 11.  The in-class final has been scheduled by the registrar for Sunday, March 14, at 8 AM.

There will be one take-home midterm exam, and a final exam with both take-home and in-class portions.  
<p>

There will also be regular in-class quizzes beginning the second week of class.  These quizzes will cumulatively count toward your grade as an additional exam.

Unexcused late homework will receive partial credit depending on how late it is.  Late homework will be excused only in case of serious illness or similar situation.  

<p>

An additional proof-writing assignment will be assigned weekly, on Monday, and is due at the beginning of class the next Monday.  These proofs will be graded on a credit or no credit basis, except that those turned in late will receive partial credit.  Proofs receiving no credit can be rewritten for full credit, as many times as necessary.

 <br><!-- Grades Separator --> <table bgcolor=#7397b0 border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2width=100%> <th align=left><a name="grades"></a>Grades</th> </table> <p><!-- Information --> Your course grade will be computed out of 500 points, as follows:  200 points for the final exam, 100 points for the take-home midterm, 100 points for the quizzes, and 100 points for homework.  Class participation will be considered in assigning letter grades in borderline cases.

<p>

Class participation will be graded each day as credit or no credit.  To receive credit, you need only be present, do your best to respond if asked a question, and work together in small groups as directed.  Credit does not depend on volunteering to speak, or on whether your answers are correct.  Credit does depend on whether your group is actually working together as a group.<p> <br><!-- Honor Principle separator --> <table bgcolor=#7397b0 border=0 cellpadding=2cellspacing=2 width=100%> <th align=left><a name="honor"></a>The Honor Principle</th> </table> <p><!-- Honor Principle details -->Academic integrity and intellectual honesty are an integral part of academic practice.  This does not mean thatyou can't work on homework together or get ideas and help from other people.  It does mean that you can'tpresent somebody else's work or ideas without giving them due credit.<p> Feel free to discuss homework problems with other people and to work together to answer them.  You mustwrite up the answers yourself without copying from anybody.  (This means you cannot copy down a joint solutionarrived at by a group working together, even if you were part of the group.  You must write up the solution inyour own words.)  You must also acknowledge all sources your consulted and people you worked with.  Working withother people or consulting other sources will not lower your grade.<p> Of course, no help may be given or received on exams.  <p> <br><!-- Special separator --> <table bgcolor=#7397b0 border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2width=100%> <th align=left><A NAME="special"></a>Special Considerations</th> </table> <p><!-- Disabilities statement --> Students with disabilities who will be taking this course and may needdisability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an appointment to see the instructor as soonas possible. Also, they should stop by the  <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/"> Academic SkillsCenter </a> in Collis Center to register for support services.

<p>  Students who expect to need schedule adjustments for religious reasons or because of commitments to jobs, athletics, or other extracurricular activities, should see the instructor as soon as possible.  Such adjustments are not always possible, but may be possible with sufficient advance notice.  

<p>  Students with any other concerns about the course are likewise encouraged to see the instructor as soon as possible.  Students with no concerns are also invited to come to office hours to introduce themselves,<P><img src="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m24w10/images/surfbar-75x1.png"> <br><a href="mailto:marcia.groszek@dartmouth.edu" class=small> Marcia J.
