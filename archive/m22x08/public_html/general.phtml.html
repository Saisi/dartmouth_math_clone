<i>Linear Algebra and Its Applications, with CD-Rom (3rd Edition)</i> by David C. Lay
<br>Published by Prentice Hall 
<br> ISBN-10 0321287134
<br> ISBN-13 9780321287137
<br> <small>(Available at Wheelock Books)</small><br>
<br>
This is the required textbook for the course. It will be used extensively
as a source of both readings and exercises. It is sometimes cheaper to order the book online; www.CampusI.com is a site that compares prices from various online booksellers. Make sure to search by ISBN so that you order the correct edition. The included CD-Rom contains (among other things) a study guide with detailed solutions to exercises.<br>
Other source materials will be posted on Blackboard. More detailed information is available on the Assignments page and on the syllabus.

The course will be primarily lecture-based. We will use all X-hours. This is to allow 
us to cover a good bit of material at a reasonable pace while allowing time to cover applications and do in-depth work on proof writing. It will also allow for the last day of class to be a final exam review. The course webpage will have a day-by-day schedule for the entire term (though this is subject to change during the quarter).

details are posted on the course assignment's web page.

<li>Late homework will not be accepted in the absense of divine
intervention or matters of similar weight. 

<li> Unexcused late and missing papers count zero.

<li> I will drop each student's lowest homework score.

<li>The homework will be graded on both completion and accuracy; however,
as many solutions are in the textbook and you are free to work on the homework
collaboratively, the main thing I will be looking for is that you can
explain and justify the solutions.

<!-- Information -->
There will be daily homework assignments, primarily out of the textbook, due weekly on 
Wednesdays. Additionally, there will be periodic proof assignments, wherein you are given a 
statement and asked to come up with a proof. These proofs will be graded on a credit/no 
credit basis, with unlimited rewrites allowed, where credit is given for an essentially flawless proof (in both substance and form). I will be specific in my critique and expect it to 
be rare for more than one rewrite to be necessary. <br>
Linear algebra is somewhat unique in being fundamental to advanced pure mathematics, applied mathematics, engineering, and computer science. The goal of the course is for you to become fluent in linear algebra -- both to understand the theory of linear algebra and to master the mechanics to the point where it is as basic and straight-forward to you as multiplication, and as easy to do. Just as it requires drilling to master multiplication or become fluent in a foreign language, it requires drilling to become proficient at linear algebra; however, I realize that students come into Math 22 with varying levels of experience and will need differing amounts of practice. Thus instead of requiring all students to do massive amounts of exercises, I will offer a small but significant amount of extra credit to those who do the optional drill problems that will be given with each homework assignment. They will be graded with 1 point for completion and 1 point for accuracy, and can change your grade by at most one letter (typically, from B+ to A- but occasionally from B+ to A.) You do not need to justify your answers for these problems. <br>
There will be two examinations roughly one third and two thirds of the way through 
class. Please note I do not curve individual assignments. I begin with the ten percent scale 
(90% and up an A, 80% and up a B, etc.), and will only curve at the end, and only if a 
curve is necessary. <br>
I will not grade based on attendance, though you must obviously attend on exam days. I feel there are three major reasons to come to class: (1) it's a relatively painless way to study, (2) I present the material in lecture the way I think about it -- and I write the exams, and (3) it's the easiest way to show me you care about your progress in the class -- those who cut lots of class and then run into difficulty with the material have only themselves to blame. <br>
The course grade will be based upon the scores on the exams, the homework, and the final exam as follows:

<!-- Honor Principle details -->
On Exams: No help given or received

<p>
On Homework: Collaboration on homework is permitted and encouraged, but obviously
it is a violation of the honor code for someone to provide the answers
for you. Each student is required to write up their homework individually
and list who they collaborated with.

Tutorial assistance for this course, that is, help with your homework,
will be available in 102 Bradley, Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays
evenings 7 - 10pm.  Tutorials will begin on Thursday, September 26.
<P>

Also note that the Tutor Clearinghouse will have private one-on-one
tutors available for Math 8.  The tutors are recruited on the basis
that they have done well in the subject, and are trained by the
Academic Skills Center.  If a student receives financial aid, the
College will pay for three hours of tutoring per week.  If you would
like to have a tutor, please go to 301 Collis and fill out an
application as early in the term as possible.

<!-- Disabilities statement -->
Students with learning, physical, or psychiatric disabilities enrolled
 in this course who may need disability-related classroom accommodations
 are encouraged to make an appointment to see me before the end of
 the second week of the term. All discussions will remain confidential, 
although the Student Accessibility Services office may be consulted to discuss
 appropriate implementation of any accommodation requested. At such a meeting
 please provide me with a copy of a completed "Accommodations/Consent" form, which lists
 the accommodations recommended for the student by Student Accessibility
 Services (http://www.dartmouth.edu/~accessibility/). If you do not have such
a form, please visit the Student Accessibility Services office at Collis 301.
