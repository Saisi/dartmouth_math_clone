<h3>The honor code </h3> 
You are encouraged to get help on your homework.
You can get help in our office hours, and should feel free to discuss
problems with classmates or friends. But ultimately you must work
through the problems and write up your assignment yourself. You must
not give or receive help from anyone during examinations.
