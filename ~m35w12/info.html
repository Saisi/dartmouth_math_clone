Our homework grader is Kaj Zwieniecki. He also will be conducting a problem session that will meet Thursdays 7:00-8:00 pm in Silsby Room 213. You may collaborate with other students on the homework, but you must write up all solutions independently and on your own. Copying is not permitted and is a violation of the Honor Principle (see below for more information).<P>	<B>Grading:</B> Final grades for the course are determined on the basis of performance on the homework, Midterm Exam, and Final Exam weighted as follows: <BR><ul><li>Homework: Can count for or against you in borderline situations. Each problem will be checked, and the overall assignment will be scored 0-5 on the following holistic scale:<ul><li>5 Substantially correct and complete.</li><li>4 A few minor errors, but he/she knows what he/she is doing.</li><li>3 Is usually on the right track, but has difficulty completing a problem.</li><li>2 Several blunders or conceptual errors. Is rarely on the right track. But knows how to get started.</li><li>1 Little to show.</li><li>0 Nothing worthwhile to show. Does not even write out relevant definitions and theorems consistently or correctly.</li></ul><li>Mid-term exam (at least partially take-home; due near the beginning of February): 40 points</li><li>Final exam (take-home; due on the first day of finals, Saturday March 10): 60 points</li></ul>Total Points: 100<BR><P><B>Academic Honor Principle:</B> <BR>On exams: No help is to be given or received. <BR>On homework: No copying. You may seek help from anyone associated with the course, as much as you need. You may work with other students except on exams, but must always write up whatever you are working on on your own. Copying from someone else's work, including the sharing of electronic or other files, is not permitted and is a violation of the honor principle.<P><A name=topic14><B>Students' Religious Observances:</B></A> Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term.  If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with your instructor before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.<P><A name=topic14><B>Flu or Another Serious Illness:</B></A> If you contract a flu or other serious illness, please contact your professor by email.  I will be happy to make arrangements for you to make up late work, or exams if you provide me with a note from Dick's house.  Please do not come to class if you have a flu or an influenza-like illness. The Math 35 website will contain the complete class schedule, so you will know what you've missed.  For more information on what to do if you believe you have a flu, see the <A HREF="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~prepare/common_hazards/influenza_and_illness.html">Dartmouth web page </A>devoted to this topic.  <P><A name=topic12><B>Disabilities:</B></A> We encourage students with documented disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities such as chronic diseases, learning disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities, to discuss possible accommodations with your instructor. Students might want to consult as well Student Accessibility Services, 301 Collis Center, ext. 6-2014. In addition to providing information and services, the office can assist with determining appropriate accomodations and registering them.<P><B>Math 35 Website:</B> We have a website that organizes the materials of the course. The address is http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m35w12/. There you will find all the handouts of the course, as well as the homework assignments.</BLOCKQUOTE><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p><p><SMALL> Copyright &copy; 2011 by C.
