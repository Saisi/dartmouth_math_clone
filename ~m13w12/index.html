<h2><a id = "Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>	

<p>
Math 13 is meant to be the sequel to Math 8 at Dartmouth College.  The second half of Math 8 covers differential calculus of several variables.  Math 13 starts with a quick review of relevant material from Math 8, and then covers integral calculus of several variables and vector calculus.

<h2><a id = "Exams">Examination Schedule </a></h2>

<p> There will be two midterms and a final exam.  All exams are closed book
and no calculators or computational assistants of any kind.  

<ul>
    <li> Midterm 1: Thursday, January 26, 2012, 5pm - 7pm, 104 Wilder </li>
    <li> Midterm 2: Thursday, Feburary 16, 2012, 5pm - 7pm, 104 Wilder </li>
    <li> Final Exam: March 10, 2012, 3:00pm - 6:00pm, 013 Carpenter </li>
</ul>

</p>

<p> If you are unable to be at any of these exams, please contact me as soon as possible so we can setup alternate test-taking arrangements. </p>


<h2><a id = "Grading">Grading</a></h2>

 <p>
Your grade in this class will be determined by homework and exams.
</p>

<p>  There will be two types of homework assignments: Webwork and written assignments.  Webwork is 
an automated computer-based grading system where you get slightly randomized problems, and 
try to solve them until the computer tells you your answer is correct.  We will generally use
Webwork for easier questions which are more suited for computer automated grading.  These
will usually be given out three times a week, and shouldn't take too long to complete.
</p>

<p>
Written assignments will consist of questions which will usually be more difficult than 
Webwork assignments.  You will need to write down solutions which justify your answers and
turn them in.  
</p>

<p>
There will be two midterm exams and a final examination.  All exams will be at a specified
location and will be closed book.
</p> 

<p> 
Each of the above contributes to your final grade in the following fashion:
<ul>
    <li> Homework, Webwork: 10% </li>
    <li> Homework, Written: 10% </li>
    <li> Midterms: 20% each </li>
    <li> Final exam: 40% </li>
</ul>

</p>

<h2><a id="Homework">Homework Policy</a></h2> 
<p>
Written homework assignments will be posted at the <a href = "homework.html">homework page</a> of this website, and will be usually due about a week after they are posted.  Late assignments will only be accepted when granted an extension, which must be requested from the instructor several days in advance.  In general, extensions will only be granted for health-related reasons or family emergencies.  Exceptions may be made for school-related travel. </p>

<p>
The homework collaboration policy for this class is more or less in line with other Dartmouth math classes.  You are allowed to collaborate with others on homework, but must write your own solutions.  A good rule of thumb is that you should never be copying phrases or sentences from anyone else or any source.  You may use theorems, lemmas, etc. that we have covered from the textbook, but in general you should not use theorems, lemmas, etc. from sections of the book we have not covered or from external sources.  Also, please write down the people you collaborated with and outside sources (namely, anything besides the required textbook) you consulted on your homework assignments.  
</p>

<h2><a id = "Textbook">Textbook</a></h2> 
 <p>
 The required book for this class is <em>Calculus</em>, 7th edition, by James Stewart, ISBN 978-0538497817.  This is the same book that Math 8 used in the fall; Math 8 students who are not taking Math 13 might be selling their books at a reduced price.    
 </p>

<p> There are many books about calculus.  The following are a few books which might be worth consulting:</p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Div, grad, curl, and all that</em>, 4th Edition, by H.M. Schey, ISBN 978-0393925166. </br>

    This book takes a more informal and physics-inspired approach to the material in the second half of the class.  It is            well-written, contains many exercises, and is not particularly long, so this book might be a useful supplement to the main text.
</li>

<li> <em>Calculus, Volume II</em>, 2nd edition, by Tom Apostol, ISBN 978-0471000075. </br>

This book contains a lot of the material we will be covering in this class, in a slightly more abstract way.  This book also contains linear algebra, and so is able to present multivariable calculus in a more generalized and uniform setting.  
</li>

<li> <em>Calculus on Manifolds</em>, by Michael Spivak, ISBN 978-0805390216. </br>

This book is for more ambitious students, who are interested in understanding the material in the second half of the class in a more general context.  Students who intend to major in mathematics or theoretical physics will be the ones who find this book relevant.  If you choose to read this book you will probably need outside assistance to do so.
