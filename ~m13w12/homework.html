<center> <h1>Math 13: Homework Assignments</h1> </center>

<p> 
<a href = "https://webwork.dartmouth.edu/webwork2/m13w12/">Webwork page</a> for 
Math 13: shortly before the first day of class (or perhaps on the first day of 
class), you will receive an automated message from the Webwork homework system 
detailing how to login.  You should make sure the Webwork system is working,
and if you do not receive an email, please message your instructor as soon as
possible to get an account set up.

<h2> Written Homework Assignment List</h2>

<p>In general, homework should be turned in either in class or by 4pm the day the homework is due (usually Friday), at the homework box in the bottom floor of Kemeny or at my office.  Solutions will be posted a few days after each homework assignment is due.  There is no guarantee that the solutions are free of typos, though hopefully they are free of mathematical errors!
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Mar 25 2012 news: Solutions were taken down at the request of next term's Math 13 instructors. </li>
  <li> Mar 1 2012 news: The last written homework is now posted.  Notice the due date of Wednesday, not Friday!  This homework will be graded and available for pickup on Thursday evening in the homework boxes, so you can have them in time to study for the final. </li>
  <li> Feb 27 2012 news: HW8 is now available.  Notice that it is due on Friday; sorry for the shorter than usual notice.  There is no Webwork due on Wednesday so hopefully that frees up a little bit of time!</li>
  <li> Feb 11 2012 news: Problem #6 on HW5 is being moved to HW6, and does not
need to be turned in on HW5.  
</ul>
