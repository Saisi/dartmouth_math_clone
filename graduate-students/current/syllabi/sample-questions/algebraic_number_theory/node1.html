Introduction</A>

<P>
Graduate students often ask what they should study in preparation for
a qualifying exam.  The answer is of course that definitions,
statements of theorems, examples and sketches of proofs of major
theorems are the norm in a qualifying exam.  However, this information
is often not perceived by the student in the same way as it is
intended by the faculty member.

<P>
To address this disparity, I have included below a number of sample
questions to help you prepare for the algebraic aspect of the number
theory qualifying exam.  These questions reflect only some of my own
prejudices, and are not meant to reflect questions which other
examiners might ask.  These questions are in no sense intended to
reflect a comprehensive review of the material, but should give you a
good idea of the type and depth of question which you might be
expected to answer.  In particular, if you are not comfortable with
the vast majority of the material reflected by these questions, you
are not ready to take the qual.

<P>
In the exam itself, expect to be asked questions like those below, but
also some which go beyond the bounds of your knowledge, and possibly
outside the bounds of the syllabus. It is by probing the boundaries of
your knowledge that we ascertain the depth of your knowledge.  You are
not expected to know the answer to everything we ask, but you are
expected to know a majority.

<P>
Caveat:  These problems have not really been proofread yet, but I
wanted them available ASAP.
