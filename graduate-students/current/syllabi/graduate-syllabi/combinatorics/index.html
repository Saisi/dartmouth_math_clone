<P><P>
<BR>
Because of the unusual breadth of combinatorial mathematics,
the topics in the subject relevant to the graduate certification
requirement have been divided into primary and secondary topics.
The student is required to have a basic knowledge of each of the
three primary topics and at least one of the secondary topics.
The primary topics are (1)&nbsp;Classical Combinatorics, (2)&nbsp;Algebraic
Techniques, and (3)&nbsp;Graph Theory.  The secondary topics include
(A)&nbsp;Ordered Sets, (B)&nbsp;Coding Theory, (C)&nbsp;Combinatorial Geometry
and Matroids, (D)&nbsp;Matching Theory, (E)&nbsp;Random Graphs and the
Probabilistic Method, (F)&nbsp;Symmetric Functions, and (G)&nbsp;Representations
of the Symmetric Group.  Other topics could serve as secondary topics
with the approval of the GEC in consultation with the combinatorics
faculty.
