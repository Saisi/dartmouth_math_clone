<ul>
  <li> On Exams: No help given or received. <br></li>
</ul>

<ul>  
<li>On Homework: Students are encouraged to work together with one or two classmates and/or to seek help from the instructor. Those students who do not know of anyone to work with but would like to collaborate should contact the instructor.  Students should state on their homework paper the names of those with whom they have collaborated. What is important in doing homework is the eventual understanding of the problems. 
When a student writes up a homework solution it is to be his or her own understanding of how to solve the problem. The solutions that a student submits must be written by him or her alone. Any copying of another person's solutions, in whole or in part, will be regarded as a violation of the Honor Code.</i> <br></li>
