They provide a natural language and      set of tools through which we can describe and explore the world around      us.&nbsp; For instance, in mathematics and physics differential equations      can be used to describe the path that light will travel in exotic      geometries. In engineering differential equations can be used to model how      a bridge will twist under stress. And in finance, (stochastic)      differential equations are used to help price financial derivatives (e.g,      options, futures &amp; credit derivatives).<br>      <br>      This course will focus primarily on methods for obtaining exact solutions      to various types of differential equations, but (as time permits) we will      also explore means of ferreting out qualitative information about      solutions based on the form of the differential equation. Topics will      include some of the following.</p>    <ul>      <li>Techniques for solving first order differential equations</li>      <li>The Existence and Uniqueness Theorem</li>      <li>Second Order Linear Equations</li>      <li>Systems of First Order Linear Equations (with an introduction to        matrices)</li>      <li>Power Series and Power Series Solutions to ODEs</li>      <li>Fourier Series and Partial Differential Equations</li>    </ul>    <h3>Textbook</h3>    <p>Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems (<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #cc0000;">9th

        5, 2013</span> is the last day to withdraw from a course (<a target="_blank"        href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/calendar/term/2013-09.html">Fall
        2013 Term Calendar</a>).</p>    <h3>Honor Principle</h3>    <p>You are encouraged to work together on homework. However, the final      writeup should be your own. On exams, all work should be entirely your      own; no consultation of other persons, printed works, computing devices,      or online works, or online sources is allowed without instructor's      explicit permission.</p>    <h3>Student with disabilities</h3>    <p>Any student with a diagnosed learning disability requiring accommodations      should see instructor and Ward Newmeyer (Director of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~accessibility/">Student
