We present a computational methodology based on boundary integral equations
that can deliver fast, high-order numerical solutions of three-dimensional
scattering problems in domains that exhibit a wide range of material
properties (e.g. perfectly conducting materials, dielectric materials,
dielectrics with metallic coatings) as well as a variety of geometrical
features (e.g. closed and open surfaces, edges and corners).  Our approach
uses a combination of the following main elements (a)
Pseudodifferential-calculus-based design of well-conditioned integral
equation formulations leading to small numbers of Krylov-subspace iterations
for a wide range of electromagnetic scattering and transmission problems;
(b) High-order resolution of the singularities of the solutions of the
boundary integral equations in non-smooth domains; and (c) Use of equivalent
sources, FFT-based acceleration algorithms.

Joint work with A. Anand (IIT Kanpur, India), O. Bruno (ACM Caltech), and J.
Chaubell (JPL Caltech).
