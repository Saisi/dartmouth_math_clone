I study differential equations models of nerve cells and brain
networks. I don't think that anybody knows, at this point, whether that sort
of work will prove to be a significant part of understanding the brain. I
will give examples of issues I have thought and written about, mostly
concerning gamma oscillations, i.e., approximately 40 Hz oscillations in
electrical fields in the brain.
