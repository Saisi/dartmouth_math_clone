A classical problem in electromagnetics concerns the solution of the
time-harmonic Maxwell equations in the low-frequency and static regimes.
When solving scattering problems from a simply connected body, standard
integral equation methods (analytical and numerical) provide sufficient
means with which to calculate the scattered field. However, when the
scatterer is multiply connected, topology plays a fundamental role and
calculating the scattered field is not so straightforward. In fact, for
multiply connected conductors, at zero frequency the standard boundary
conditions on the tangential components of the incoming magnetic field do
not uniquely determine the induced surface current, and thus do not uniquely
determine the scattered field. With this in mind, we will describe a new
consistency condition (independent of gauge) on the vector potential that
overcomes this non-uniqueness and resolves a long-standing difficulty in
inverting the Magnetic Field Integral Equation (MFIE). Numerical examples of
this stabilizing consistency condition in axisymmetric geometries will be
shown.
