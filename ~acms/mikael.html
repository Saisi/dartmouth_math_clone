A 20-year search has been on to find
photonic crystals (periodic
dielectric structures) with the largest possible full photonic
bandgaps. A large, robust bandgap is key to the many applications of
these materials, which include near-lossless waveguiding, optical
filtering, optical computing, and others. A number of three-dimensional
structures with large gaps have been proposed (e.g., a diamond lattice
of spheres,[1] the "Woodpile" structure [2]), and in two dimensions,
structural optimizations to find the largest-bandgap  structure have
been performed, (e.g., in refs. [3-4]). So far, however, there has been
no work on finding rigorous limits on how high the bandgap may be. In
this talk, I present upper bounds on the bandgaps of one- and
two-dimensional photonic crystals.
