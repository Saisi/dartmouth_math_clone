I will introduce potential theory, which lets you reformulate PDEs with
piecewise-constant coefficients as an integral equation problem on the
material interfaces (boundary) alone. This allows much more efficient
solution that, say, finite element methods, especially in the case of wave
scattering. However, it also has certain challanges that I will discuss,
such as quadrature schemes.
