The talk will overview our work on optimization of devices for acoustic (or
electromechanical) wave propagation. The devices typically operate in the
interface between a source, for instance a transducer of a wave guide, and
surrounding space. Numerical optimization techniques are attractive to use
in the design of interfacial devices, since the properties of transmission
and distribution often are quite sensitive to geometric changes. We employ
two different strategies to define the admissible designs. The first
strategy (boundary shape optimization) uses explicit boundary displacements
with respect to a reference domain, and body-fitted deforming meshes are
employed in the computations. In the second strategy (the material
distribution approach to topology optimization), the coefficients in the
governing equations are directly manipulated by the optimization algorithm,
and the computations uses a fixed, typically uniform mesh. Both approaches
have their pros and cons. For instance, the first approach yields higher
accuracy, but the second offer more general admissible designs. These
methods will be illustrated by numerical results from the design of
loudspeaker horns, acoustical lenses and “labyrinths”, and from the design
of nontraditional brass instrument bells. Some very recent results of
optimizing the layout of a microstrip patch antenna will also be presented.
