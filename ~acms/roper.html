Familiar species; humans, mammals, fish, reptiles and plants represent only
a razor's edge of the Earth's immense biodiversity. Most of the Earth's
multicellular species lie buried in soil, inside of plants, and in the
undergrowth, and include millions of unknown species, almost half of which
are thought to be fungi. Part of the amazing success of fungi may be the
elegant solutions that they have evolved to the problems of dispersal,
growth and adaptation and adaptation to changing environments. I will
describe how we using both math modeling and experiments to discover some of
these solutions. I will focus on (i) how cytoplasmic mixing enables some
species to tolerate internal genetic diversity, making them better pathogens
and more adaptable, and (ii) how self-organization of these flows into
phases of transport and stasis enables cells to function both as transport
conduits, and to perform other functions like growth and secretion.
