We will discuss a second application of the Partition Decoupling
Method to the networks derived from the roll call votes of U.S.
Congresses.  In aggregate, our results present a mathematical
codification of ideology.  These results compare favorably with other
models of ideology (such as those derived from the spatial models of
Poole and Rosenthal) as they reveal much of the same information,
albeit from a different perspective, and perform significantly better
on standard metrics.
