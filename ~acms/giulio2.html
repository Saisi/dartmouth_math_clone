I am going to introduce some of the most used clustering
algorithms in real applications, that is, hierarchical clustering (also
known as average linkage clustering or UPGMA), kmeans clustering and
spectral clustering, trying to show some of the mathematical connections
recently discovered in between kmeans clustering and spectral clustering
involving mainly linear algebra tools. Moreover I will show how some of
these arguments can be used to link hierarchical clustering and kmeans
clustering.
