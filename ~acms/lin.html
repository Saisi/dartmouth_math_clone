Numerical computation of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian to high
accuracy is known to be difficult. The boundary integral
method has been used to tackle this problem, turning it into a nonlinear
eigenvalue problem. We present a method of computing eigenvalues of the
planar
Dirichlet Laplacian by first constructing the Fredholm determinant of a
boundary
integral operator using the Nystrom method with product quadrature to handle
weakly singular kernels, then solving for zeros through Chebyshev expansion
and polynomial root finding. Singular values are also used to obtain high
accuracy at close eigenfrequencies. An exterior resonance can occur for
concave domains which results in spurious eigenvalues. We overcome this by
using a combined layer potential. Our analysis gives exponential convergence
rate for analytic domains.
