There are two questions I'm particularly interested in
addressing: 1) how does the brain overcome signal redundancy resulting from
anatomically divergent connections; and 2) how does attention change the
activity of neurons in the brain. My results suggest that the cellular
mechanisms by which attention alters neuronal activity may actually also
help reduce signal redundancy in specific anatomical circuits that have high
divergence (thalamocortical circuits). I will detail our experimental
methods for identifying and recording from connected neurons participating
in thalamocortical circuits in awake-behaving animals performing an
attention task. I will then describe our results which indicate that
attention increases the efficacy of neural communication and also increases
signal-to-noise in these circuits. Interestingly, the manner by which
attention increases signal-to-noise may also help overcome signal redundancy
in highly divergent thalamocortical networks.
