The reduced basis method (RBM) is indispensable in scenarios where a large
number of numerical solutions to a parametrized partial differential equation
are desired in a fast/real-time fashion. These include simulation-based design,
parameter optimization, optimal control, multi-model/scale simulation etc.
Thanks to an offline-online procedure and the recognition that the parameter-induced
solution manifolds can be well approximated by finite-dimensional
spaces, RBM can improve efficiency by several orders of magnitudes. The
accuracy of the RBM solution is maintained through a rigorous a posteriori error
estimator whose efficient development is critical.

In this talk, I will give a brief introduction of the RBM and discuss recent and 
ongoing efforts to develop RBM in the Galerkin and Collocation frameworks including 
applications to various electromagnetic problems.
