<td>Billiards with rational caustics have the special property that one
can inscribe into the billiard boundary a one-parametric family of
p-periodic orbits of the associated billiard- (aka Poincare-) map. Slight
perturbations of the boundary destroy the curve of periodic points in SOS
and a region analogous to the whispering gallery near boundary - existing
in any strictly convex billiard domain - appears. This time however, the
region is deep inside the domain.

<p>In this talk the construction and algorithms for generation of
billiard domains with rational caustics are presented. They leave enough
degrees of
freedom to allow one to influence the position of the invariant curve in
SOS. The application of these billiard domains as asymmetric resonant
cavities will be discussed and justified by numerical simulations.
