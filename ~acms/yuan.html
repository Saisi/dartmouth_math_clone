 Stokes flows are laminar fluid motions that are dominated by high
dissipation, and due to its simple nature, chaotic dynamics is often not
expected in Stokes flow. In this talk we report interesting dynamics due
to
fluid-structure interaction and fluid-interface interaction in Stokes
 flow.
<p>
 When an elastic fiber is moving in a Stokesian fluid, it may become
 susceptible
 to buckling instability when moving in the neighborhood of a hyperbolic
 point
 of the flow.  When the stagnation point is part of a spatially-extended
 cellular flow,
 it is found that fibers can move as random walers across time-independent
 closed-streamline flow.  It is also found that the flow is segregated into
 transport regions around hyperbolic stagnation points and their manifolds,
 and
 closed entrapment regions around elliptic points.
<p>
 Another example is a viscous drop immersed in Stokes flow with
 time-varying
 rotation.  Due to the fluid-interface interaction, the drop dynamics
 becomes
 chaotic even in the Stokesian regime.  The chaotic dynamics is found to
 arise
 from a cascade of period-doubling bifurcations.  We will further discuss
 how
 this findings can be useful in designing micro-fluidic  mixers.
