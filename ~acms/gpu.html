The talk will cover aspects of GPU computing and will use Inverse Problems
as an application example. Performance gains and algorithm design in
accelerating computations with GPUs varies between dense linear algebra and
sparse linear algebra operations. The application example will allow to
discuss how GPUs perform differently in these two domains, and how this
relates to hardware architecture and algorithm implementation. Part of the
talk will cover design considerations related to the implementation of an
Algebraic Multigrid Sparse Solver on GPUs and current results from ongoing
work in this area.
