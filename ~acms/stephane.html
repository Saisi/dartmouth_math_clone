We present a novel approach for the numerical solution of problems of
diffraction by infinitely thin screens and apertures. The new methodology
relies on combination of weighted versions of the classical operators
associated with the Dirichlet and Neumann open-surface problems. In the
two-dimensional case, a rigorous proof is presented, establishing that the
new weighted formulations give rise to second-kind Fredholm integral
equations, thus providing a generalization to open surfaces of the classical
closed-surface Calderon formulae. High-order quadrature rules are introduced
for the new weighted operators, both in the two-dimensional case as well as
the scalar three-dimensional case. Used in conjunction with Krylov subspace
iterative methods, these rules give rise to efficient and accurate numerical
solvers which produce highly accurate solutions in small numbers of
iterations, and whose performance is comparable to that arising from
efficient high-order integral solvers recently introduced for closed-surface
problems. Numerical results are presented for a wide range of frequencies
and a variety of geometries in two- and three-dimensional space, including
complex resonating structures as well as accurate numerical solutions of
classical diffraction problems considered by the 19th-century pioneers:
diffraction of high-frequency waves by the infinitely thin disc, the
circular aperture, and the two-hole geometry inherent in Young's experiment.
