In this talk, I will show how basic techniques from differential geometry
are applied in the research of general relativity. Specifically, I am going
to examine the behavior of a model of the ``quasi-local energy'' of the
gravitational field, recently proposed by Liu and Yau, near a point and near
the null infinity in a 4-Lorentzian manifold.  Some preliminary results of
potential interest to physicists will be presented but the focus of the talk
will be on the underlying geometry.

<p>
A tentative list of topics that will be discussed in the talk:
<ol>
<li>normal neighborhood on the null cone of a point
<li>orthornormal null moving frames adapted to a space-like submanifold
<li>isometric embedding of a closed space-like orientable 2-surface into a
Lorentzian manifold 
<li>asymptotic structure of a Lorentzian manifold at null infinity
<li>gravitational radiation (mass loss and energy flux)
</ol>
