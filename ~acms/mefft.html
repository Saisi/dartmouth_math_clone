The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) has revolutionized signal processing since
it reduced the cost of extracting the frequency spectrum of a signal of
length N from O(N^2) to O(N log N). It was recently voted one of the "top 10
algorithms of the 20th century". It is an essential part of any applied
mathematician's toolkit. I will explain in simple terms how the algorithm
works, and show a couple of applications.
