Programs like iTunes Genius and Pandora Internet Radio attempt to
create mixes of songs that are similar to each other based on various
features. These programs rely on individual song analysis by music experts.
In this work, we attempt to compare songs by finding structure or
significant features using numerical linear algebra and statistics (i.e.
without listening to the songs). In this talk, we will also discuss previous
work by M. Casey, C. Rhodes, and M. Slaney.
