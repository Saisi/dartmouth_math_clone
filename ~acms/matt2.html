Memory consolidation is understood to be one of the crucial functions of
sleeping. Correlations between (lack of) sleep and cognitive performance are
well-documented, but the mechanistic underpinnings are only just becoming
clear at the level of single neurons. In the last decade, it was shown that
certain cells in rat hippocampus which encode spatial information (so called
place cells) are reactivated during sleep in temporal patterns that are
similar to their patterns during survival-salient behavior while the rat is
awake. For example, when the animal is trained to run along a track for a
food reward, it encodes a sequence of place cell activity. This pattern is
"replayed" when the rat is asleep, indicating that explicit repetition of
the neural correlate of experience is part of the memory consolidation
process. This phenomenon was discovered by a "template matching" analysis
that searches in sleep data for an experimenter-derived expectation of the
repeated pattern (the template). From a functional perspective, however, it
is not clear what constitutes a salient memory. In other words, why would
the rat replay the maze and forsake all other experiences? The answer is
clearly that it doesn't, but finding such novel replayed patterns requires
an unsupervised approach to the template matching method. I will discuss
such an approach that uses the full windowed autocorrelation matrix, C,
of a time series to mine for repeated patterns independent of the prejudice
of the experimenter. The matrix C is dense but structured so it can be
filled and manipulated efficiently for many classes of operations. In
particular, it can be used to build a Markov chain whose stationary
distribution can be used to identify the repeated patterns in the data. I
will demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on data with known
patterns and, if time permits, I will discuss issues with scaling this
technique to long recordings (10<sup>6</sup> time points).
