<td>The Method of Particular Solutions (MPS) for the Laplace eigenvalue
problem
was popularized in a famous paper by Fox, Henrici and Moler in 1967.
The idea is
to approximate the eigenfunctions from a space of particular
solutions that satisfy
the eigenvalue equation but not necessarily the boundary conditions.
However, for more complicated domains bases of particular solutions
quickly tend to become
ill-conditioned. In the first part of this talk we discuss tools from
numerical linear
algebra that allow to overcome these ill-conditioning problems and
generalize these ideas to
domain decomposition approaches that use particular solutions in each
subdomain.
In the second part of this talk we discuss the convergence of the MPS
by using techniques
from complex approximation theory. This allows us to give accurate
exponential convergence
estimates on certain domains.
We present several examples including multiply connected domains,
eigenvalue avoidance phenomena
and localization of eigenfunctions.
