Navigation of knowledge spaces (like Wikipedia) depends on one's objective.
If one's objective is to try to find something efficiently with regard to
the number of nodes visited, then there are well developed network
geometries to help one navigate.  But if one's goal is discovery of the
unknown, then what are good candidates for the geometry?  In this talk, we
will examine a candidate for such a geometry.  This geometry is constructed
via a coupling of the notion of a network with directions with an adaptation
of the four-point probe from materials testing. This four-point probe
geometry shares many of the properties of hyperbolic geometry, wherein the
network directions take the place of the sphere at infinity.  This enables
orienteering of the space with the directions serving as the points on a
compass.  Real world examples will be presented, and my hope is to make this
talk very accessible; in particular, no prior knowledge of hyperbolic
geometry is necessary.
