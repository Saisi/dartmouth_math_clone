I will present equations that govern vesicles, a closed inextensible lipid membrane, suspended in a two-dimensional Stokes flow.  Integral equations are used to recast the equations as a system of integro-differential equations.  In order to simulate suspensions that contain large volume fractions of vesicles, we require preconditioners, fast summation methods, near-singular integration, and adaptive time stepping.  Results for bounded and unbounded flows will be presented.
