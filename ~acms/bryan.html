Whittaker, Nyquist, Kotelnikov and Shannon developed the sampling
theory and interpolation formula for bandlimited signals over fifty
years ago. Their theories show how a continuous function, with a
Fourier Transform of finite width, can be completely reconstructed
from its discrete sample values if it is sampled at a sufficient
uniform rate.  We interpret sampling theory using the Wigner
Distribution Function, time-frequency or phase-space description often
encountered in signal processing, optics and quantum mechanics. We
show how this interpretation offers significant insight into sampling
and interpolation. In particular we discuss the sampling of signals
that have a variable local bandwidth, implying that in certain places
the signal varies rapidly while in others it varies more slowly. The
subject of non-uniform sampling, in which the sampling rate changes in
correspondence with the local bandwidth, has been an active of
research for over two decades and has application in many areas of
science. We believe that the Wigner interpretation offers new insight
into the optimum non-uniform sampling distribution and interpolation
formula for particular signals.</td>

<h4>Biography</h4>

Bryan Hennelly received his BE in Electronic
Engineering from University College Dublin (UCD), Ireland in 2001. He
was awarded his PhD, also from UCD, in optical engineering three years
later having made contributions to three separate areas of optical
science; optical metrology, optical encryption and the development of
fast algorithms for use in optical signal processing. Having spent a
number of years lecturing, he is currently a postdoctoral researcher
in the National University of Ireland, Maynooth and is a fellow of the
Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology. At
present he conducts research in digital holography, 3-D image
recording and 3-D optical displays.
