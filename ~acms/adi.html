<td>A common visual illusion is the 'line-motion-illusion':  a movie of a
quickly
flashed nonmoving square followed by a long, nonmoving bar giving rise
to the visual sensation that the bar is growing outward from the
square.  Recent experiments by Grinvald et al. suggest that the
primary visual cortex (V1) is actually 'fooled' by this illusion -- the
cortex responds as if a growing bar were presented.  Using a
large-scale computational model of V1, I will explain possible network
mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.</td>
