Fluid membranes are area-preserving interfaces that resist bending. They 
are
models of cell membranes, intracellular organelles, and viral 
particles.
We
are interested in developing simulation tools for dilute suspensions of
deformable vesicles. These tools should be computationally efficient, 
that
is, they should scale well as the number of vesicles increases.
For 
very
low Reynolds numbers, as it is often the case in mesoscopic length 
scales,
the Stokes approximation can be used for the background fluid.
We use a
boundary integral formulation for the fluid that results in a set of
nonlinear integro-differential equations for the vesicle dynamics. The
motion of the vesicles is determined by balancing the nonlocal 
hydrodynamic
forces with the elastic forces due to bending and tension. Numerical
simulations of such vesicle motions are quite challenging. On one hand,
explicit time-stepping schemes suffer from a severe stability constraint 
due
to the stiffness related to high-order spatial derivatives and a milder
constraint due to a transport-like stability condition. On the other 
hand,
an implicit scheme can be expensive because it requires the solution of 
a
set of nonlinear equations at each time step. We present two 
semi-implicit
schemes that circumvent the severe stability constraints on the time 
step
and whose computational cost per time step is comparable to that of an
explicit scheme. We discretize the equations by using a spectral method 
in
space, and a multistep third-order accurate scheme in time. We use the 
fast
multipole method to efficiently compute vesicle-vesicle interaction 
forces
in a suspension with a large number of vesicles. We report results from
numerical experiments that demonstrate the convergence and algorithmic
complexity properties of our scheme.
