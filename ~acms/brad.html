Quasiseparable matrices are a general class of matrices with low
off-diagonal rank.  These matrices are attractive for numerical computation,
as storage scales linearly, allowing for large simulations, and algorithms
for standard matrix operations are of linear complexity, allowing for quick
manipulation.  The use of quasiseparable matrices in the context of solving
Helmholtz boundary value problems in one and two dimensions will be
discussed, as well as problems with scaling to the three-dimensional case.
