Recently, a pair of engineering colleagues of mine were stymied by
the computational difficulties associated with a seemingly
straightforward image processing problem (that of performing fast,
stable, and loss-less image rotations). Their stymiedness appears be
well justified, as the computationally simple solution to their
problems turned out to be steeped in the lore of some rather serious
(though quite charming!) mathematics. In this talk, we will go on
an adventure from image processing to quantum field theory and back
again to solve  their  problem.

<p>
Note: I will not expect to know quantum field
theory, image processing, or
serious mathematics.
I will try my best
to keep the prerequites down to linear algebra and multivariate
calculus. (Though, being a brown bag seminar, a certain amount of
intestinal fortitude wouldn't hurt!)
