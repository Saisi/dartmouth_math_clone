<p>In optical sciences the term "superresolution"
is typically used for systems
and signal processing methods with imaging and beam shaping capabilities
exceeding the classic Rayleigh diffraction limit. The presentation briefly
outlines the importance of the Rayleigh limit as a way to estimate the
resolution optimum for a wider class of problems and why it is nevertheless
not a limit in a rigorous sense. In the second part of the presentation
different superresolution techniques will be compared qualitatively. It will
be argued that in many instances the term 'superresolution' mislabels the
technique in question. A classification of superresolution techniques is
suggested for recognizing similarities between different methods. A third
part of the presentation will focus on a specific linear superresolution
technique, the PDFT algorithm. The versatility of the PDFT algorithm is
demonstrated by discussing a number of applications ranging from diffraction
tomography and synthetic aperture radar to generalized sampling and
compressive imaging.
