<td>Shortly after Riemann published his landmark existence theorem for conformal
maps, many constructive methods for such maps emerged. Unfortunately, these
methods require the knowledge of numbers or functions that are very
difficult to compute by hand except in limited, simple circumstances. Thus
conformal mapping remained a means for solving a few famous problems, or for
making general statements. Today the situation is utterly different. Free
software exists to compute conformal maps quickly in a wide variety of
situations, and some classical but still-important problems can be solved in
quite arbitrary geometry to as much accuracy as one could hope for. In the
future we can expect the tools to become better integrated and more
automatic, more easily applied to design and inverse problems, and to expand
to include regions that are still difficult, such as those with high
connectivity.
