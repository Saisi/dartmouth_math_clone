Most of my recent work has focused on robustly extracting
relevant structure from network models of complex systems.  In this talk,
I'll give an overview of the types of problems I am interested in and the
broad questions I try to answer.  To place this on more concrete footing,
I'll give an example of recent work - k-spectral centralities.  k-Spectral
centralities are measures of importance for subsets of networks.  We will
discuss how to derive these measures from spectral information given
assumptions on information propagation in the network.  We will also give
concrete examples from economics, political science, neuroscience and
microbiology.</td>
