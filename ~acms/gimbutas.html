In this talk, we describe a new class of solvers for the equations of
electromagnetic scattering.  The approach combines newly developed
representations for the solutions of Maxwell's equations with
high-order discretizations to obtain rapidly convergent algorithms.
The schemes deal effectively with several vexing problems
normally associated with electromagnetic simulations: "low-frequency
breakdown", "spurious resonances", etc.
