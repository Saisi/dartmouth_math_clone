<td>Electric Impedance Tomography is a technique that involves estimating the
conductivity and permittivity of and object from boundary measurements. The
measurements are performed by applying a series of electrodes to the surface
of the object under measurement, by passing some low frequency AC currents
through some of the electrodes and by measuring the resulting potentials at
the remaining electrodes. The problem of reconstructing the
conductivity/permittivity profile, withing the object, from such
measurements is ill-posed, and regularization techniques are needed in order
to obtain meaningful images. Classical regularization techniques limit
however the capability of reconstructing images with rapid spatial changes,
such the ones occurring at the boundary of two materials with different
properties, or at the interface between two different biological organs, or
as the step change presented by abnormal tissue with respect to normal
tissue. The talk will focus on the application of the Total Variation
functional as a Tikhonov regularization functional, as this results in
reconstruction algorithms that are able to describe step changes in the
tomographic images.
