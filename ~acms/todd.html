We first describe a result on the (lack of) sensitivity of the optimal value to
a misspecification of the objective function coefficients, followed by a short
proof of a result of Edelman and Strang that the probability that a random
triangle is acute is 1/4. The two parts are
unified by their reliance on the invariance properties of Gaussian 
random vectors.
