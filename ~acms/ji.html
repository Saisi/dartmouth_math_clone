In this talk, I will touch based on several recent developments on characterizing biomechanics of the human brain in quasi-static (i.e., image-guided neurosurgery) and high-rate dynamic (i.e., sports-related concussion) conditions using stereovision, image analysis, and finite element modeling. Challenges currently facing biomechanical research of the human brain will also be briefly discussed.
