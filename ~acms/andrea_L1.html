<td>Parameter estimation in inverse problems is traditionally formulated as a
least squares model fitting problem, with quadratic regularization. In the
presence of outliers on the data, an in the context of ill-posed problems,
the use of least squares approaches is particularly sensitive to data
errors. Use of least absolute values fitting (1-norm on the data term)
approaches is robust to presence of outliers and can produce meaningful
results where least squares approaches fail. The use of the 1-norm is also
interesting as an approach to regularization, leading to Total Variation
regularization. This approach allows reconstructing parameters with much
faster spatial variations compared to traditional quadratic regularization
approaches. A Primal Dual Interior Point framework for the estimation of
parameters in inverse problems using the 1-norm on the data and
regularization terms will be discussed and practical application examples
will be shown.
