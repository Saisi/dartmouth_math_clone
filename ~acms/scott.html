Greg Leibon, Dan Rockmore, Rob Savell and I recently
developed a new statistical learning method which we call the
Partition Decoupling Method that, in contrast to established
hierarchical methods, is aimed at decomposing complex systems into
multiple overlapping partitions of the system.  In this talk, I will
introduce the method via an initial application to the U.S. equities
market where the partitions reveal interesting geometric and
functional structure.  (Attached is a copy of our first paper on the
subject).
