This talk treats computational methods applied to certain
electromagnetic phenomena in underground remote sensing.
The research is undertaken to help address the long term
environmental cleanup problem posed by unexploded ordnance
(UXO) on lands where military activities or conflicts have
taken place. UXO pose dangers in the event that they are
disturbed such that they may explode; or they may leak
contaminants into the surrounding environment.</br>

Currently our sensors cannot detect explosive encased in
metal underground, thus we must detect and characterize
the metal shells. The requisite surveying and remote
sensing must employ electromagnetic devices operating at
low frequencies in order to penetrate the ground. Together
with the constraint that we must survey only from above
ground, this means that resolution is quite limited - no
visual images of the sort available in medical settings
are possible. Instead, one must analyze the
characteristics of complex electromagnetic responses to
infer information that might be useful in discriminating
harmful materials from innocuous objects.</br>

Our numerical modeling and analysis have been applied to coupled
Laplace and Helmholtz equations. While the latter is frequently
regarded as a wave equation, in fact in this context it supports
only diffusion. Computational results have been vital for
understanding the underlying low frequency electromagnetic phenomena, for knowing what to expect and what might be useful, and for specific discrimination processing of signals. This
talk summarizes some of the progress we have achieved by
applying integral equation approaches, "thin skin"
approximations, the method of auxiliary sources, the
standardized excitations approach, and other methods. A
recurrent theme is the achievement of leaps in
computational efficiency by avoiding computing. That is, we
bring to bear sagacious changes of basis, limitations on
the spectrum of operators, or specially applicable
approximations and manipulations of governing relations.
These avoid tangling with intractable or at least daunting calculations
that would be required by more obvious, straight-ahead
approaches and thus lead more directly to the desired results.
