<p>The dynamics of deformable particles such as drops and cells in flow
represents a long standing problem of interest in many branches of science
and engineering, for instance because of its relevance to the rheology of
emulsions and biological suspensions such as blood. The problem is
challenging because the shape of these "soft" particles is not given a
priori but is governed by the balance between interfacial forces, e.g. due
to stretching and/or bending of the interface, and fluid stresses. In this
talk I will present theoretical analyses of the behavior of a
surfactant-covered drop and a vesicle (formed by a closed lipid bilayer
membrane) in various flows. Analytical solutions by perturbation expansions
and numerical solutions using Boundary Integral Method will be presented.
