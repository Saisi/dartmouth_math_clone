<td>Nonlinear oscillators are ubiquitous in physical, biological, and
  engineered systems.  Simple external forcing, for example periodic
  pulse-like forcing, can dramatically modify the behavior of
  oscillators and networks of oscillators, inducing a wide range of
  responses which includes entrainment (phase-locking) and chaos.
<p>
The first part of this talk concerns a systematic computational
  strategy for analyzing the dynamical behavior of pulse-driven
  oscillators.  This work builds on recent theoretical advances by Q.
  Wang and L.-S. Young, who discovered and elucidated a general geometric
  mechanism underlying these phenomena.  Their theory predicts some
  general dynamical features shared by a large class of pulse-driven
  oscillators; the computational strategy proposed here provides
  model-specific information and complements the theory.  Throughout, I
  will illustrate the main ideas via the Hodgkin-Huxley model, a
  prototypical neuron model.
<p>
  The second part of the talk concerns on-going work (joint with E.
  Shea-Brown and L.-S. Young) on the response of small oscillator networks
  to stochastic stimuli.  This work is motivated by questions regarding
  the ability of neural networks to respond reliably to repeated
  presentations of complex signals.  I will discuss preliminary
  numerical results and what they tell us about geometric mechanisms
  which can cause a network to behave unreliably.
