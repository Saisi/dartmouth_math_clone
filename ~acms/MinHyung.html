Numerical simulations of the wave scattering from the layered media have widespread applications such as thin-film solar cells, left-handed materials, and geosciences. In this talk, several algorithmic issues will be discussed for the Helmholtz and Maxwell's equations in layered media. First, the Green's function in layered media will derived with the transfer matrix method and Hankel transform/Sommerfeld integral. Then, a parallel fast integral equation solver based on the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) for the Hankel and Bessel functions will be presented.
