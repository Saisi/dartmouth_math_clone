Partial differential equations (PDEs) are used to model a wide range of 
physical phenomena.  Since it rarely possible to solve these PDE analytically,
there are a wide range of numerical techniques for approximating the solution.  One commonly used technique is the finite element method.  In this talk, we will introduce the basic concepts behind the method and explain why 
it is so popular.
