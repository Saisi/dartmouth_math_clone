Boundary integral equations yield very efficient solvers for a special
(but large and important) class of partial differential equations. They
hinge crucially on the accurate computation of the singular integrals
involved. I will present a new scheme that computes these integrals,
discretized by Nystr√∂m methods, for even hypersingular kernels very
simply and accurately to high order.  Moreover, the scheme is
dimension-independent and lends itself to acceleration via FMMs or
related techniques.
