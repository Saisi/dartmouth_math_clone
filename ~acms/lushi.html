Microorganisms play an important role in nature. Understanding aspects of
their locomotion and collective behaviour is essential to understanding many
biological and physical phenomena. Mathematical modelling and fast
computational methods can help with that task.
<p>
I will present a new model and simulation method that enables us to trace
the dynamics of a large number of motile particles. These micro-swimmers
interact with each-other and the fluid they are suspended in and can affect
by their locomotion. This fast computational method uses the immersed
boundary framework and enables us to efficiently simulate the dynamics of
thousands of such swimmers and the fluid flows they collectively generate
depending on their propulsion mechanism. I will illustrate the method by
showing examples of collective dynamics in large suspensions of "pusher" and
"puller" micro-swimmers. The model satisfactorily captures macroscopic
organisation and fluid flows observed in experiments of bacterial baths. A
few applications and extensions of the method will be discussed, e.g. in for
bacteria suspensions in drops and channels, or for synthetic
chemically-powered micro-particles.
