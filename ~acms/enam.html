<td>In recent years, nonlinear optics has become the subject of intense study.
This is driven both by potential applications in such areas as
telecommunications and links with other fields such as Bose-Einstein
condensates. Of particular interest are the study of optical solitons and
their stability in various media. The talk begins an introduction to the
basic concepts and a brief history of light and will end with a discussion
of ring-shaped solitons in two-dimensional photorefractive media. In the
case of a self focusing saturable nonlinearity, these solitons are found to
be unstable while solitons of the same type may be stable if the saturable
nonlinearity is self-defocusing.
