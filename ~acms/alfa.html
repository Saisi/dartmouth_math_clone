Since their first applications in scattered data interpolation on irregular surfaces 
in the 70's, RBF methods have become increasingly popular for the numerical solution 
of PDEs. The methods are relatively simple to implement without mesh or special grids, 
independent of dimensions, and extensible to be hybridized with other methods. This talk 
will cover practical implementation of RBF methods related to interpolation, nodes adaptivity, 
and PDE collocation in finite difference and partition of unity modes. We present numerical 
experiments showing spectral convergence with respect to the local problem resolution 
and algebraic convergence with respect to the partition size. Several simulations in 
MATLAB will be shown.
