Complex fluid problems, such as magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), involve
multi-physics and multi-scale phenomena that require advanced
techniques in scientific computing in order to be solved efficiently.
The MHD systems yield time-dependent nonlinear systems of partial
differential equations that couple a fluid with other internal
properties (magnetic field in MHD).  In this talk, I will discuss the
application of a first order least squares finite-element
discretization method and multilevel solvers to solve such systems of
equations.  The goal is to solve the systems as efficiently as
possible, while approximating the physical properties of the system
accurately.  To accomplish this, tools such as nested iteration and
adaptive refinement are used.  In addition, the energetics of the
system are considered in order to develop a more physically-tractable
scheme. Finally, examples of solving various MHD test problems and, if
time, multiphase flow problems will be given.
