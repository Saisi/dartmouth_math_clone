In this talk, I will describe a new variational formulation of the inverse Stefan
problem introduced in <i>Inverse Problems and Imaging, Volume 7, 2(2013), 307-340</i>, where
information on the heat flux on the fixed boundary is missing and must be found along
with the temperature and free boundary. This type of inverse problem arose, in particular,
in a bioengineering problem on the laser ablation of biological tissues. I employ optimal
control framework, where boundary heat flux and free boundary are components of the
control vector, and optimality criteria consists of the minimization of the sum of L2-norm
declinations from the available measurement of the temperature flux on the fixed boundary
and available information on the phase transition temperature on the free boundary. This
approach allows to tackle situations when the phase transition temperature is not known
explicitly, and is available through measurement with possible error. It also allows for the
development of iterative numerical methods of least computational cost due to the fact
that for every given control vector, the parabolic PDE is solved in a fixed region instead
of full free boundary problem. I prove well-posedness in Sobolev spaces framework and
convergence of discrete optimal control problems to the original problem both with respect
to cost functional and control.
