We present a general construction for dependent random measures based on
thinning Poisson processes on an augmented space. The framework is not
restricted to dependent versions of a specific nonparametric model, but can
be applied to all models that can be represented using completely random
measures. Several existing dependent random measures can be seen as specific
cases of this framework. Interesting properties of the resulting measures
are derived and the efficacy of the framework is demonstrated by
constructing a covariate-dependent latent feature model and topic model that
obtain superior predictive performance.
