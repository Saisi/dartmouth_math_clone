<td>This talk will be a crash course on the Method of Particular Solutions as a technique for computing eigenvalues and eigenmodes of differential operators in a bounded domain &Omega;. The MPS has been highly successful with the Laplace operator, which can be viewed as the quantum Hamiltonian of a free particle in &Omega; (a quantum billiard). Preliminary results about the extension of this method to a particle in a linear potential confined to &Omega; will be discussed.
