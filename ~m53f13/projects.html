</h2>
<p>Here's a preliminary list of potential topics. Please read around on
chaotic dynamics and keep on the look out for
ideas that interest you. All suggestions welcome!
However, in the end your topic choice must be approved by me,
since I don't want you to attempt something impossible.
Projects are not required to have a numerical (computer) component,
however computing is a nice way to build intuition about a topic. I
encourage
mixing theory, proofs, background, and computer experiment.
You will enjoy reading through the previous projects from this course
(see previous terms webpages), and getting inspired.&nbsp;&nbsp; You
are welcome to take a previous project further or study a related
question.&nbsp; You are <span style="font-weight: bold;">not </span>allowed
to copy or reuse previous material.
</p>
<p>You should choose a tentative project topic by October 14.&nbsp; You
are welcome to work in pairs or solo.</p>
<p>A preliminary 1-2 page (single spaced) project plan description with
a couple of
references (which you have looked at!)
is due on October 29.<br />
</p>
<p>Projects will be presented starting Friday Nov 15.&nbsp; The 5 page
write-up is due November 22.&nbsp; <br />

<h4>Topics</h4>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any of the "Lab Visits" in the book: summarise the original
research papers,
numerically investigate some of their findings </li>
  <li>Billiards: ball bouncing in a billiard table can be chaotic.
Write
code to show bouncing motion in some simple chaotic table. Measure the
Lyapunov exponent numerically, or review billiard theory. (Enough room
for more than one different project here). Very similar is chaotic
scattering from the exterior of a set of balls, related to the cover of
Ott's book. How
accurately can you predict the future ray path here? </li>
  <li>Review work on 3- or n-body gravitating problems. This includes
the history of Poincare's solution (for which he was given the prize
even
though the solution was wrong...).
Simulate a simple such solar system using ODEs, animate their orbits.
There are some crazy n-body periodic orbits out there. </li>
  <li>Figure out the details of 2-3 "Challenges" (proofs) from the
book, and
write up their proofs using LaTeX typesetting, the standard which makes
equations look beautiful. This is a more pure-mathy, exposition
project. </li>
  <li>Compare different ways of measuring fractal dimensions, on
real-world
sets, and discuss Hausdorff vs box-counting. </li>
  <li>Explore some other chaotic maps, such as 'kicked rotator', as
their
parameter is varied. Connects to KAM theorem (present overview of
this). </li>
  <li>Dig deeper into, and simulate, different types of bifurcations,
Hopf, etc. (Use Strogatz <i>Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos</i> book). </li>
  <li>Discuss some biological models for synchronization.
See book by J. D. Murray, <i>Mathematical Biology</i> (1993,
Springer-Verlag). </li>
  <li>Discuss nonlinear oscillations in economic models. You may want
to contact Tilman Dette '10 about this. </li>
  <li>Understand and present properties of the Mandelbrot and Julia
sets in detail, using the book
by Peitgen, Jurgens and Saupe, <i>Chaos and Fractals</i> (1993,
Springer). et al </li>
  <li>Write code to find and plot the stable and unstable manifolds of
2D maps,
and find out what happens when S and U touch!
Reproduce some of the plots from Ch. 10. Investigate for other maps. </li>
  <li>Build a mechanical, electrical, chemical, etc (depending on your
existing skills) chaotic system and
compare against a simple ODE computer simulation. Measure its Lyapunov
exponent. </li>
  <li>Find a chaotic toy and analyse it, compare to numerical
simulation. </li>
  <li>Chaotic dynamics in fluid flow, eg chaotic water wheel, or more
real-world situations. </li>
  <li>Chaotic dynamics in systems of 2 or more neurons with
Hodgkin-Huxley ODE models. </li>
  <li>Try out the idea of Chris Danforth (UVM) and James Yorke of
using shadowing to improve ensemble forecasting in a simple 2d map
(see their Phys. Rev. Lett. paper of 2006). </li>
  <li>Quantum chaos: either study PDE analog of billiards above (the
drum problem), or quantized torus maps (matrix algebra problem).
Harder. </li>
  <li>Collect some time-series data, either existing, or from a system
such as the dripping tap, and apply techniques of Ch. 13 to search for
underlying dynamics. One example is the stock market.
Another is: heart EKG or climate data (e.g.
Eric Posmentier (Earth Sciences Dept, Dartmouth). </li>
  <li> Summarize work of Posmentier, E.S., 1990: Periodic,
quasiperiodic, and chaotic behaviour in a nonlinear toy climate model.
Annales Geophysicae, 8 , 11, 781-790. </li>
  <li>Use deterministic chaos to numerically generate music or and art
piece, review works or performances which have used concepts from our
class
(this is clearly a more `far-out' project, but I encourage you to
consider it) </li>
