<center><h1>Math 23 Spring 2012<br /> Differential Equations</h1></center>


Differential equations relate a function to some expression involving its derivatives or partial derivatives.  Any quantity that obeys rules involving its various rates of change can be modeled with these equations.  These kinds of equations therefore occur throughout the sciences, engineering, economics and medicine.

<p>Note that you do not need an appointment to attend regularly-scheduled office hours.  If you have a conflict you may make an appointment to meet outside those times.</p>

<p><b>Textbook:</b> <a href= "http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP000254.html">Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems</a> by Boyce and DiPrima. 9th edition.  </br>
<b>Supplemental Textbook:</b> <a href= "http://www.jirka.org/diffyqs/">Notes on Diffy Qs: Differential Equations for Engineers</a> by Jiří Lebl.
</p>

<p><b>Students with disabilities</b>who will be taking this course and may need
disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an appointment to see
their instructor as soon as possible. Also, they should stop by the Academic Skills
Center in Collis Center to register for support services.</p>



<h2>The Honor Principle</h2>

<p><b>On Exams</b>: No assistance may be given or received except that you may ask the instructor for clarification of a problem.  In particular, no calculators or computing devices may be used.</p>

<p><b>On Homework</b>: You are permitted and encouraged to collaborate with other students on the
homework. However, after discussing the problems, you should each write up the final
solutions in your own words.  You may use calculators and approved software.  Additionally, you may consult your class notes
and text.  It is a violation of the honor code for someone to provide the answers for you.</p>

<h2>Suggested software</h2>
<em> Direction Field and Solution Plotter: </em><a href="http://www.math.ubc.ca/~israel/applet/dfplotter/dfplotter.html">Web based</a><br/>
<em> Another Direction Field Plotter: </em><a href="http://alamos.math.arizona.edu/ODEApplet/JOdeApplet.html">Web based</a><br/>
<em> Vector Field plotter: </em> <a href="http://techmath.uibk.ac.at/numbau/alex/dynamics/ode2d/index.html"> Web based</a><br/>


<h2>Lectures and Exams</h2>

<p>Lectures will be held Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, with x-hour used when needed.</p>

<center><b>If you have a conflict with a scheduled exam contact your instructor as soon as possible.</b></center>

<h2>Homework and Tutorials</h2>

<p><b>Homework</b>  will be assigned from the text and will be due at the beginning of each class.  The three lowest 
homework scores will be dropped.</p>


<p><b>Tutorials</b> are an additional resource for you to get help with the course.  Similarly to office hours, they are times set aside for you to come for assistance with material.  We have one teaching assistant, Nathan McNew.</p>

<center><table class="info">

<p>Finally, through the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/tutors/index.html">Academic Skills Center</a> you may join a study group or obtain a private tutor.</p>


<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>For each individual student, we will compute two different weighted averages of
homework and exam scores, using the weights indicated in the two columns below.   The
higher of the two will be used to determine the student's final grade.</p>

<center>
<table class="info">
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Midterm 1</td><td>27.5%</td><td>20%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Midterm 2</td><td>27.5%</td><td>20%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Homework</td><td>15%</td><td>15%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Final Exam</td><td>30%</td><td>45%</td>
