<h1>Homework due day 16</h1>

<h3>Own basic professional webpage</h3>

Get a <code>gauss</code> account if you don't already have one.
Create a barebones website that includes a link to your teaching statement
from yesterday. It can be very simple, just titles, a paragraph of text, and a link to an image.
Include a link to a PDF file (this could be your edited draft teaching statement),
and make sure you are linked to from our <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/people/people-select?list=grads">department list of graduate students</a>
using the department Intranet set up by Tom.

<h3>Readings on professional aspects</h3>

Three very short
readings from Krantz: Sec 3.1 (esp p.90 on dress), 3.6 (esp p.101 on being a
powerful figure), and 4.10.

<p>
Also think of some questions on teaching for the faculty who will
be there to offer advice in the 2nd half.
