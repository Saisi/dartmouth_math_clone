<h1>Homework due day 15</h1>

<h3>Teaching Statement</h3>

Write your own teaching statement, using what you have learned from your teaching experiences and M147 so far. This will become a draft for you to build upon as you prepare your portfolio for the job market.

<h3>Questions for us</h3>

Write down some questions for us (Rosa &amp; Alex) about teaching specifically at Dartmouth, practical issues, etc. E.g. when do I make a syllabus? To whom do I talk to get advice about X,Y,Z? Etc.

<p>
We will do our best to get answers back to you for Thursday.
