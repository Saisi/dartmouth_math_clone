<h1>Homework due day 2</h1>

<h3>Individual 5-min Research Presentations</h3>

Prepare a 5-minute blackboard presentations on something interesting
related to your
research area. Assume an audience background of your peers.
We will stick to the 5 minute time limit, and they will be videotaped.

<h3>As a group</h3>

In the same way as we did in class for Math 1 and Math 24,
come up with higher-level goals for Math Camp 1.
(You cannot come up with content goals since you haven't picked a topic yet!)
Come up with at least 8 of them (this is to enable each of you to work on one
later, while having one left over).
Bring the list to class (one copy for all of us).
