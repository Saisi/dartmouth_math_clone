<h3>Thinking about Teaching Statements</h3>

Since we got feedback from you that prior graduate students preferred to think
about their <i>own</i> ideas for their teaching statements, <i>before</i>
reading other's statements, this is what we suggest you do:

<p>
Sit down and collect some things that you'd like to put in your
teaching statement. Remember it's a statement of teaching philosophy,
but also contains some of the practical things you do as a teacher
that work well or go beyond the ordinary.  Think about ideas from the books
you've read for this course, and what you have found useful in
practice.

<p>
Once you have your own ideas, read a few statements of teaching philosophy from
mathematicians' websites.  Bring your favorite and be ready to say
what you like about it.
