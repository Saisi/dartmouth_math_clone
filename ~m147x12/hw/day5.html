<h1>Homework due day 5</h1>

<h3>Group work on Math Camp 1 topic &amp; organization</h3>

Form an overall plan for your math camp.  Include goals (both general goals
and
specific mathematical goals), an outline of topics and timing (probably this will take the form of a draft spreadsheet), ideas about
what activities might happen when, and a plan for sharing responsibility.
Remember
that there should always be at least one observer at any given time; there could be more,
depending
on your evaluation activities.
