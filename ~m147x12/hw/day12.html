<h1>Homework due day 12</h1>

<h3>Creating interaction</h3>

Prepare to give a 5-minute classroom activity
from any part of your MC2 lesson plans, that incorporates
an interaction between you (the professor) and <i>every student
in the class</i>.
We will go down to 007 and act like typical students, ie, some
of us will respond too much, and some hardly at all. Your job is
to <i>plan</i> activities that force us all to interact with you.
Be creative &amp; have fun - this is your chance to explore new techniques.


<h3>Math Camp</h3>

Please plan out the remaining lesson plan(s). They needn't be
complete, but each hour of the math camp should now have a draft
lesson plan.  This enables you as a group to look for connections
between the topics, rationalize/simplify your notation, and make
improvements.
