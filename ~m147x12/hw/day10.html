<h1>Homework due day 10</h1>

<h3>Practise lecture on board and voice work</h3>


A) Prepare a 5-7 minute lecture on a calculus topic of your choosing (eg
from the course you will be teaching next year, or anything you like)
focusing on blackboard and voice work. You will deliver them in 007; we will
all sit on the back row, and all provide anonymous feedback.
You should do the following things:
<ul>
<li> plan out which board you will write each thing on, and write something on
<i>all six</i> boards from the left and center panels as viewed by students
(let's say the right side is covered by the projector).
This is slightly artificial since in the short time you can't write much, so
you may have to put just one or two things on each board for this.
<li> refer to something which you deliberately left exposed on a previous board
<li> use color effectively
<li> speak loudly and clearly
</ul>
(You may ask questions from us "students" if you want.)
The point of this is to help you make good board work automatic so it will
come more naturally in MC2 and your future lectures. (In the heat of the
moment some of your board work suffered during MC1.)

<p>
We will start with a vocal warm-up exercise!

<p>
B) work on your first lesson plan, and have a draft, need not be finished.
You may need to coordinate with the others to know which ideas/concepts have
already been introduced. (The full lesson plan will be done for Wed).

<p>
Have fun with it,               Alex & Rosa
