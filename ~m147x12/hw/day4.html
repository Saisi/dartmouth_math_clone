<h1>Homework due day 4</h1>

<h3>Individual 5-min Video Response</h3>

Watch your taped sample presentation (this can be painful or embarrasing for any of us; you may find it helpful to schedule in instructor to watch it with you). Write an analysis (about 1 page),
including what you were
trying to accomplish (your goals for the presentation), how well you think
you
did, and what you learned from the audience responses and from watching the
tape.
Conclude by discussing specifically
how you hope to further develop or improve as a
lecturer
in the near future. 

<p>
Include as an appendix the actual audience
response forms, as we don't have copies.

<h3>Math Camp Topic</h3>

As a group, agree on an overall topic for MC1.
Keep your goals in mind, talk to the graduate students who did this
recently about what worked, and please avoid the topics from the last two years (or at least keep overlap minimal, since some high-school students come back).
