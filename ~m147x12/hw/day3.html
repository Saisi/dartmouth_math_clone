<h3>Designing an evaluation plan for one math camp goal</h3>


Each student takes one distinct math camp goal and designs an evaluation plan.

<p>
Please be detailed on how you will obtain numerical data to evaluate
your assigned goal.

<p>
For instance if you plan to count number of comments/questions.  What
indicates
success? A given number?  A given rate?  An increase over time?
If you ask a question try to think of what answers are you looking and what
will
indicate success.
