<h1>Homework due day 14</h1>

<h3>Unconscious stereotyping</h3>

Take an online Implicit Association Test <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/demo/takeatest.html">here</a>.
I recommend you do either the race one or one of the gender ones, although
there are some other more obscure categories there too that you could try.
It should take about 20 minutes, mostly binary categorization
of words and faces.

[The one I took had a second part with a bunch of questions about US politics, for the IAT people's own data gathering. I think this was because of it was the "Featured Task" in the top right of the page
(gearing towards presidential election). - Alex]
