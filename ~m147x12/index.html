</center>

<h3>Readings</h3>
Required books for purchase (please ask if having trouble finding):
<ul>
<li>Steven Krantz, "How to Teach Mathematics," 2nd edition (AMS, 1999).
<li>John Meier and Thomas Rishel, "Writing in the Teaching and Learning of Mathematics" (MAA, 1998).
<li>E. Rogers, N. Davidson, and B. Reynolds,
"Cooperative Learning in Undergraduate Mathematics: Issues and Strategies
That Work" (MAA, 2001). <i>Out of print and available as photocopy in binder</i>
</ul>

To be done by day 1 of seminar. (These books are available to borrow from Kemeny 200.) Each of you will pick one book (via a sign-up sheet) to read completely, and do selected readings from the other two (to be announced):
<ul>
<li> James Zull, "The Art of Changing the Brain" (2002).
<li> Richard R. Skemp, "The Psychology of Learning Aathematics," expanded American edition (1987)
<li> Eleanor Duckworth, "The Having of Wonderful Ideas and Other Essays
on Teaching and Learning," 2nd edition (1996)
