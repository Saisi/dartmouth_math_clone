		  <td>
			<p style="text-align : justify">  Combinatorics began as the study of counting,
			e.g., how many ways are there to order an <i>n</i>-element set?  With the ascent
			of the digital computer, combinatorics has taken on vastly more applications and
			has become a mature and indeed extremely active area of mathematical research.
			We will learn basic combinatorial techniques and we will apply them to solve
			problems in design and optimization.  The course will take us in many directions
			including algorithms, probability, graphs, and games; but most importantly
			it will help us reason mathematically with discrete objects.</p>

                        <p><em>Prerequisites:</em> Math 8, placement into Math 11, or permission of the instructor. <i>Dist:</i> QDS.

			<p style="text-align : justify"> Students are encouraged

			homework problems, and not how that is achieved. The honor
			principle applies to homework in the following way. <span
			style="color:#CC0000; font-weight:bold">What a student
			turns in as a written homework solution is to be his or her own
			understanding of how to do the problem. Students must
			state what sources they have consulted, with whom they
			have collaborated, and from whom they have received
			help.</span> Students are discouraged from using solutions
			to problems that may be posted on the web,
			and as just stated, must
			reference them if they use them. The solutions you submit
			must be written by you alone.  Any copying (electronic or
			otherwise) of another person's solutions, in whole
			or in part, is a violation of the Honor Code.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align : justify">If you have any questions as to whether some action

			would be acceptable under the Academic Honor Code, please
			speak to me, and I
			will be glad to help clarify things.  It is always easier
			to ask beforehand than to have trouble later!</p>
