Math 20, Spring 2011</h1>

<h2>Homework</h2>

</center>

In general, written assignments will be due every Wednesday and will cover the material in the previous week's classes. Assignments must be turned in by 12:30 p.m. on their due dates in the boxes outside 105 Kemeny (our classroom). Look for the boxes for Math 20, Spring 2011 and put your homework in the box on the <b>left</b>.

If you have signed and returned the <a href="M20Sp11_FERPA.pdf">FERPA waiver</a>, you can collect your homework from the box on the <b>right</b> after it has been graded. If you do not give me a signed copy of the waiver, you can collect your homework during office hours by showing me your Dartmouth ID.
