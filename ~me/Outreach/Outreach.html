				<p> For the 2012-2013 academic year, I was a GK-12 fellow.  GK-12 is an NSF funded, and Dartmouth administered fellowship
				that pairs middle school teachers with graduate students in STEM disciplines to develop inquiry-based classroom modules (Click 
				<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~academicoutreach/gk12/">here</a> for more information). Below
				are links to the write-ups of lessons that were developed as part of this collaboration.</p>
			
			
			
				<p> If you are interested in using any of the following lesson plans in the classroom, feel free!  Click on the titles below to see the full write-up
				If you have any comments or suggestions on the lessons, I would appreciate feedback.</p>
			
				<ul>
					<li><a href="Fibonacci%20Dominoes.pdf">Domino Tilings and Fibonacci Numbers</a>: A middle-school level activity which builds students
					abilities to reason.  Students will discover the well-known combinatorial property that the number of tilings of a 2x<i>n</i> rectangle
					with dominoes is the Fibonacci numbers.
				
		</li>
					<li><a href="MusicMath(Final).pdf">Music and Math Project</a>: This is a 3-4 one hour class period module developed by Alex Barnett
					and me with guidance from Ilene Kanoff.  This is a middle school level activity for students who have had basic algebra.  
					In it students learn the relationship
					between frequency, pitch, and pipe length.  They then use this information, and algebra skills, to build their own musical pan pipes from
					straws whose lengths they have precisely computed.  The included module write-up includes lesson plans, in-class worksheets, out-of-class
					homework, as well as grading rubrics.</li>
	
					<li><a href="Number%20Devil%20Curriculum%20Guide.pdf">The Number Devil Project</a>: This is a middle school project that can be shortened
					or expanded to fit a number of different time periods.  The project focuses on incorporating reading, writing, critical thinking, and independence into the math classroom. Students will
					work in groups to read an assigned chapter from the mathematical fiction book, <i>The Number Devil</i>, by Hans Magnus Enzenberger. Students
					will then be responsible for the math concepts covered in their assigned chapters, will compose a writing piece detailing the math, and
					create a technology presentation to share this information with the other students.</li>
