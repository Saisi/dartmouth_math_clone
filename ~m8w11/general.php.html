NAME="hw"></a>Homework Policy</th> </table>
<p>


<!-- Homework policy information -->
<ul>

<li>There will be two separate parts to your homework assignments. The
first,
called <a href="https://webwork.dartmouth.edu/webwork2/m8w11"  class="palebg">WeBWorK</a>,
is submitted on the Internet.  WeBWorK assignments will be made each
class day, as indicated on the <a href="assignments.php.html"
class="palebg"> Homework Assignments</a> page.  Each WW assignment
will be due at 11:15 am on the subsequent class day.  You will only be
able to submit the assignment during the time that it is open; at 11:15
am on the due date, the assignment will close and shortly thereafter,
the correct answers will be available to view.
</li> 
<br /> 

 <li>The second part of the homework consists of several problems from
 the textbook which will be assigned weekly.  They are to be handed in
 before class on the day they are due; they will be returned to the
 homework boxes outside of your classroom in Kemeny.  In general, late
 homework will not be accepted for a grade, and never without prior
 arrangement.  Illness and family emergency are the two main reasons
 why an extension on homework may be granted.
</li>   
<br />


<a name="NB"></a>
<li> Written homework assignments will be graded much as the problems
on your exams will be graded, that is the graders will be looking at
the work which supports your answer even more than the answer
itself. In particular, a correct answer with no justification will
receive no credit, whereas mostly correct work and a tiny error may
receive a substantial amount of credit.  Solutions should be written
in an organized and legible manner.  The purpose here is to prepare
you for how your exams will be graded.  <br /><br />

WeBWorK helps you master the mechanical skills;
the written work assesses your ability to explain what you know.
</li> 
<br />

<li> The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a
Federal law that protects the privacy of student's education records
as well as providing a considerable amount of privacy concerning their
academic status and grades.  As such, we cannot return graded written
homework assignments in a public fashion (such as in a pile on a desk
or in homework boxes outside XXX Kemeny) unless you sign a waiver
forfeiting your rights to privacy for grades on your written homework
assignments.  These waivers will be distributed on the first day of
class, and whether you sign them or not will have no impact on your
performance in this class.  If you choose not to sign a FERPA waiver,
you will need to visit your instructor's office to pick up your
homework assignment there, and may need to present your student ID if
your instructor insists on verifying your identity.  The waiver does
not apply to exams, which will be returned in a private fashion.
Waivers may be signed at any time after the first day of class.  If
you did not pick one up in class, they are
available <a href="handouts/FERPA-m8w11.pdf" class="palebg" >here</a>.</li>  <br />



<!-- <li>There will also be practice problems listed each class day consisting mostly of odd numbered problems from the text for those students who wish to do additional problems.  These are optional and are not to be handed in.
You can login to <a href="http://hotmath.com">http://hotmath.com</a> (using the password supplied in lecture) 
to see hints and complete solutions of many of these problems.  </li> -->

<p>

<!-- Honor Principle details -->

<p>
<b>On Exams:</b> All exams are closed book, and no help is to be given
or received. No calculators, computers, cell phones, or other
electronic aids are allowed.
</p>

<p>

<b>On Homework:</b>Collaboration is permitted and encouraged - a
discussion of the general idea of homework problems with instructors,
tutors, fellow students and others is desirable. However, each student
is expected to complete his or her assignments individually and
independently. Computing devices are allowed on homework, although
they will not be necessary. As a general rule of thumb, you should
understand why the solution you write down is correct, and should
write the actual solution up on your own.</p>

<p>For written homework assignments, please write down the names of people with whom you collaborated. 
</p>

<p>If you have any questions as to whether some action would be
acceptable under the Academic Honor Code, please speak to your
instructor, and we will be glad to help clarify things. It is always
easier to ask beforehand.

Tutorial assistance for this course, that is, help with your homework,
will be available in 008 Kemeny Hall, Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays
evenings 7 - 9pm.  Tutorials will begin on Thursday, January 6.
<P>

Also note that
the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/tutors" class="palebg">Tutor
Clearinghouse</a> will have private one-on-one tutors available for
Math 8.  The tutors are recruited on the basis that they have done
well in the subject, and are trained by the Academic Skills Center.
Please check out
the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/" class="palebg">Academic
Skills Center</a> for more information.

<p>

<!-- Disabilities statement -->

<p> We encourage any students with
disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities such as chronic
diseases and learning disabilities, to discuss appropriate
accommodations with your instructor, which might help you with this class, either
after class or during office hours. Dartmouth College has an active
program to help students with disabilities, and we are happy to do
whatever we can to help out, as appropriate.  
</p>

<p>Any student with a documented disability requiring academic
adjustments or accommodations is requested to speak with their instructor by the end
of the second week of the term. All discussions will remain
confidential, although the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/" class="palebg">
Academic Skills Center
</a>  may be consulted to
verify the documentation of the disability and advise on an
appropriate response to the need. It is important, however, that you
talk to us soon, so that we can make whatever arrangements might be
needed in a timely fashion.
</p>

<p>Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that
occur during this academic term.  If you have a religious observance
that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with
us before the end of the second week of the term to discuss
appropriate accommodations.
</p>
