<h2>WeBWorK and Math 8</h2>
</center>

<blockquote><p><p>

<h3> I. What is WeBWorK ? </h3>

<em>WeBWorK</em> is a system that allows students to do their homework
in an interactive web-based environment.

<br /> 
<br />
Using <em>WeBWorK</em>, students may try to answer homework problems
more than once.  After each try, a message appears telling the student
whether the answer is correct or not.  This provides immediate
feedback to the students, allows them to discover what they did wrong,
and hopefully allows them to understand the topic of the question
better.
<br />
<br />
Each <em>WeBWorK</em> problem set is individualized. Each student has
a different version of a problem generated from a fixed template; for
example the numerical values in the formulas may be slightly
different). <p><p>

<h3> II.  How anybody can try out WeBWorK</h3><p><p>

Anyone with an internet connection can try out WeBWorK by following
the directions in Part III below and using the <strong>Guest Login</strong> 
button at the bottom of the login page.<p>

<h3> III.  How to use WeBWorK to do your homework</h3><p><p>

  Using <em>WeBWorK</em> is quite simple.<br />
  
 Below are the basic steps on how to get started.<br /><br />
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> Most pages of <em>WeBWorK</em> also contain
  directions.  Therefore, if you are ever unsure of what you should
  do, try reading the directions and descriptions on the page at which
  you are looking.<br /> 

<OL>
<li>You can use any computer with a browser like  Firefox,
Opera, Safari, or MSIE.  A note of caution is the IE on the Mac may have
some issues with secure pages, so if problems arise, try another browser.


<li>Open your browser and go to your
  <em>WeBWorK</em> course page:
  <!--a href="http://webwork.math.rochester.edu/"-->
  <a
  href="https://webwork.dartmouth.edu/webwork2/m8w11"class="palebg" >https://webwork.dartmouth.edu/webwork2/m8w11</a></a>.
  
<li>On that page you will find the
  necessary information about logging in.<br /> 
  To log in, enter your
  login name and password, and click on the 'Continue' button.<br />
  Your <strong>login name</strong> is the usually just your last name,
  followed possibly by a digit for people in the class with the same
  last name (e.g. smith, smith2, ...)). Possible exceptions include
  compound last name like "den Hartog" or "De La Huerta" which would
  be rendered Hartog and Huerta respectively.


 <br /> Your initial <strong>password</strong> is (unless you gave me
  something else) your six-character student ID ``number''. 

<li>If
  your login is incorrect, you will be told so, and you can return to
  the login page and try again.

<li>If you are registered for the course, you should receive an email from your
  instructor confirming your login and password prior to the first day of classes.


<br /> If your login is
  correct you will see a page where you can do following:
  
<ul TYPE=dot>

<li><strong>Change your password and email address</strong><br />

You should probably change your password since it initially set to
your student ID number which is relatively sensitive data.  You should
<b>not</b> make it your BlitzMail password unless you always use a
secure connection (https) and don't typically login on public
computers to do your homework.  If you forget your password, it can be
reset, but perhaps not for 24 hours.<br>

  <li><strong>Look at and do the problems in a homework set.</strong><br />
  
  To do the first day's assignment, for example, click on the line in
  the box that starts with 'setw11day1'.  <br /> Each line listing the
  homework sets will indicate whether the set is open or closed.  If
  the set is open, that means that when you solve a problem, it will
  be counted towards your grade.  If the set is closed, you can still
  solve problems, but your results will not be recorded.  <br /> After
  the indication of whether the set is open or closed, there is
  additional information about the due date (if the set is open), or
  whether the answers are available (if the set is closed).

<!-- 
When the answers are available, you have the option of
  looking at correct answers when viewing a problem.
-->
  
  
  <li><strong>Get a printout of the problem set.</strong><br /> Most
  likely you will want to print a hardcopy of your problem set so that
  you can think about the problems and work out the solutions before
  you sit down at the computer to enter your answers.  To print out
  setw11day1, for example, select the button next to its listing and
  click on the <b>download hardcopy button</b>.  This will take you to
  a new page where you can tweak things and then press the <b>Generate
  hardcopy</b> button.  You will need a pdf reader (e.g. Acrobat
  Reader) to view the file, but most of you should have that already.
 
 <p>
    
  
  <li><strong>Look at a summary of your WeBWorK homework
  scores.</strong><br /> If you click on the button 'Grades', you will
  see your current scores for all available problem sets.  Generally
  there is no additional information.  </ul><br />
  
  <li>If you are printing out a problem set or looking at a summary of
  your homework scores, you are done.  If you are viewing a problem
  set via your web browser, you will see a page with the problems in
  the set you chose.  To view and/or answer a problem.  Notice
  that there are various modes of viewing the problem: 'plainText',
  'formattedText' and 'images', and so on.  It is best to view the problem
  using 'images' mode.  Enter your answers and
  click on the 'Preview Answer' or 'Submit Answer' button. <p>

The <b>Preview Answer</b> is extremely useful to verify the expression
you have entered is what you really intended.  The <b>sample</b> set
is one in which you can practice entering expressions.<br>


 If you are working on a
  problem set that is already closed, you will have the option to see
  the correct answer or a solution if one is available (currently only
  a few problems have solutions available).  To see the correct answer
  and/or solution, just check the box(es) and click on the 'Submit
  Answer' button (you do not have to enter an answer to see the
  correct answer or solution).  Once you have submitted an answer, you
  will be told whether your answer is correct or not.  If not, you can
  try again.  After you've tried a problem, you can either go to the
  next problem, the previous problem, or see the list of the problems
  again.  <li>If you want to check the status of your problems
  (e.g. to double check that your answers have been recorded), use the
  &quot;Prob. List&quot; button at the top of the page to see the
  problem list page.  <li> When you are finished, log out using the
  &quot;Logout&quot; button on the left side of the page.  <li>That's
  all, folks!
  
  </OL>
  
<h3> IV.  Important facts to know </h3><p><p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>What to do if you have problems with WeBWorK:</strong><br />
  <ul><li>If you have a problem logging in, contact your instructor.
  <li>If you have a problem printing out a set, ask a consultant
  at a  computer lab.  If you don't get sufficient help,
  contact your instructor or TA.  
  <li>If you have questions on specific homework problems or if you have
  comments about <em>WeBWorK</em> that you think can help us
  make <em>WeBWorK</em> better, click on the 'Feedback'
 button on any of the pages of <em>WeBWorK</em>.
  </ul>
  <li>If you are logged on to <em>WeBWorK</em> for longer that 30 minutes 
  without any activity,
  you will be asked to log in again.  This is a security measure.  You
  can resume your work after you logged back in.  All your results from
  the last login will be saved.
 
  </ul>
