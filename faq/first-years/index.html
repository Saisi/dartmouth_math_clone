<H3>Answers</H3>

<UL>
<LI><A name="Q0"></a>Who is the department's advisor for First-Year students?
<P>  
<B>Answer:</B> Professor Scott Pauls is the advisor to First-Year
students regarding matters of mathematical placement and credit.
After consulting these web resources, you should direct any further
questions to him at <A href="mailto:scott.pauls@dartmouth.edu">scott.pauls@dartmouth.edu</A>.
<P>



<li><A NAME="Q1"></A>Do I have to take any mathematics at Dartmouth?
<p>

<b>Answer:</b> No.  Surprised?!  Well, you didn't ask whether we
<i>thought</i> you should take any mathematics.  Anyway, College
degree requirements include one course in quantitative and deductive
science (QDS), and one course in technology or applied science (TAS).
All math courses count towards one of these requirements.  The
majority of courses count towards the QDS requirement; Math 16, 30,
33, 36, and 53 count towards the TAS requirement.  Most students take
at least one math course, and Math 3, 5, 6, 10 and 16 are highly
recommended for all students not going on in mathematics or in a
science.  Math 10 and 16 are especially useful for those planning a
business career.
<p>

<li><A NAME="Q2"></A>Which placement examination should I take during
orientation week?
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> There are two types of placement exams which are
given: Calculus advanced placement exams (M3 & M8),  and the Math 1
Placement Exam.

The calculus advanced placement exams are designed for students who have
had some calculus in high school, and either did not take an ETS exam
to obtain AP credit, or who did take an exam, but wish to try for
more credit than they would receive based upon their scores.  To
check what credit or placement you will automatically recieve, look at
our related web page on 
<a href="../../undergraduate/first-year-students/ap-info/index.html">
AP/IB/A-Level Information</a>.
<p>
The Math 1 placement exam is given by invitation only to those
students who might benefit from an integrated calculus and algebra
sequence offered at a somewhat slower pace than Math 3.
<p>

<li><A NAME="Q3"></A>If I am placed into an advanced placement
mathematics course, do I get credit for those courses I skip over?
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> Often, but not necessarily.  It depends upon whether
you are given credit or an exemption for a particular course.  Full
details are available at our web page on <a
href="../../undergraduate/first-year-students/ap-info/index.html">
AP/IB/A-Level Information</a>.
<p>


<li><A NAME="Q4"></A>Is it possible to transfer credit to Dartmouth
for courses taken at another college before matriculation?
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> No.  However, it is possible to receive credit for
knowledge previously acquired by taking a final examination from the
equivalent Dartmouth course during the <i>fall term</i> of your first year.
Make special arrangements for this with the Department's Advisor to
First-Year Students <a
href="mailto:scott.pauls@dartmouth.edu">Professor Scott Pauls.</a>
These arrangements <i>must be made before the last day of classes</i> in the
fall term of a student's first year.
<p>
It is possible, although sometimes not advised, to start at a more
advanced level than Math 13 without taking such a special final exam,
but in this case you do not receive credit for the courses which you
skipped.  In any event, you should discuss this thoroughly with the
advisor to first year students.
<p>

<li><A NAME="Q5"></A>Which courses for first-year students involve the
computer?
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> Practically all of them involve the computer to some
extent. The computer is a far more powerful and useful tool than a
graphing calculator, and many courses give you an introduction to ways
in which you can use the computer to enhance your understanding of
your courses.  No prior knowledge of the computer is assumed in these
courses.

<p>
<li> <A NAME="Q6"></A>If I only want to take one Mathematics course at
Dartmouth, what should I take?
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> Good question!  There really are a number of options.
If you are going on in the sciences, almost surely a calculus course
will do you some good.  For those interested in the social sciences
and humanities, calculus may not be the best option.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
 Each year there are one or more offerings of 
<b>Math 5</b>.  The topics in math 5 change from term to term (and year to year).  Some of the standard math 5 courses are:
<ul>
<li>  <b>Chance</b>: Chance is  a course which
intertwines basic statistics with its use in current journals and
newspapers.  The types of questions which are considered concern issues
like the validity of AIDS testing, or how statistics is used to support or
oppose arguments regarding the effectiveness of the death penalty.
Students often examine new studies for credibility: In a study of 500
users of Viagra, researchers noticed a 20% increase in cases of lung
cancer.  Researchers are puzzled....
</li>
 
<li> <b>A Matter of Time</b>:  Everybody knows
about time. Our everyday language bears witness to the centrality of
time with scores of words and expressions that refer to it as a
measure, a frame of reference, or an ordering factor for our lives,
feelings, dreams, and histories.  For the Aztecs time was a series of
52-year cycles. At the end of each cycle, the sun would set and for
three days and nights the universe was up for grabs before the
beginning of a new cycle. The Bible, on the other hand, inscribed
another concept of time, linear and chronological in the seven days of
creation and the detailed chronicles of endless genealogies. Playing
with time has been a favorite game in works of high culture--from the
Greek sophists to cubism--and in popular culture--from H.G. Wells to
Monty Python. And time is at the center of one of the most
revolutionary scientific theories of all time: Einstein's Theory of
Relativity. In this course we will use mathematics, literature, and
the arts to travel through history, to explore and understand Time as
a key concept and reality in the development of Western culture and in
our own twentieth century view of ourselves and of the world.
<li>
<b>Exploring Mathematics</b>:  In the fall term of 2005, exploring mathematics is 3D Animation and the Math Behind It</li>
<li><b>Pattern</b>:  This course will focus on the interplay between the art of designing repeat patterns and the mathematics of analyzing those patterns in terms of their symmetries. The exercises the students will do in the class emphasize discovery through cooperative and individual work. This class is 50% a studio art class and, therefore, requires the production of designs in print media and paint. Sufficient time and instruction is provided for students to acquire the necessary skills in this area. No previous art classes are required.</li>
</ul>






<p>
<li><b>Math 6</b> covers topics in logic, probability, combinatorics,
matrix algebra, and computing.
<p>
<li><b>Math 10</b> covers basic statistics.
</ul>


<p>
<li><A NAME="Q7"></A>Can I get advanced placement and credit for more than
just one-variable calculus courses?
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> Yes.  it is possible to receive credit for
knowledge previously acquired by taking a final examination from the
equivalent Dartmouth course during the fall term of your first year.
Make special arrangements for this with the Department's Advisor to
First-Year Students <a
href="mailto:scott.pauls@dartmouth.edu">Professor Scott Pauls.</a>
Placement and credit exams <i>must be completed before the last day of classes</i> in the
fall term of a student's first year.

<p>
<li><A NAME="Q8"></A>I have advanced placement credit and have been placed into math 11 or math 12.  Is there any alternative to taking calculus at this time?  
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> Yes!  If you are interested in mathematics beyind
calculus, you can take math 17, <a
href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/math17.html">Introduction to
Mathematics Beyond Calculus</a>.  The subject matter of math 17
changes every year and is meant to give students experience with
higher level mathematics that they might not otherwise see until later
in their undrgraduate careers.
