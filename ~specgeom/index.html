<font size=+1><b>E</b></font>igenvalue
problems involving the Laplace operator on manifolds
(and related objects such as orbifolds and graphs)
have proven a constantly fertile area of mathematical discovery,
and possess deep connections to number theory, physics, and
applied mathematics.
There has been a burst of exciting recent results on such areas as the
measures to which eigenfunctions condense in the limit
of large eigenvalue, the persistence of eigenfunctions trapped
in cylindrical regions of a manifold,
and the extent to which the spectrum of a manifold or domain determines
its shape or boundary conditions.

<p>
The conference focuses primarily on the following two topics:
<b>quantum unique ergodicity</b>
(featuring a pair of plenary lectures by Peter Sarnak), and
<b>inverse spectral geometry</b>
on compact manifolds and orbifolds (featuring a
pair of plenary lectures by Victor Guillemin).
An additional focus will be <b>quantum graphs</b>
(where the one-dimensional Laplacian acts along edges, and waves
scatter at vertices).
Here are some of
our <a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/part.php">participants</a>,
the talk <a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/titles+abstracts.pdf">abstracts</a>,
our <a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/bag_logo.pdf">bag logo</a> (!),
and on the <a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/sch.php">Schedule</a> page you can download <b>slides</b>
from many of the lectures and posters.

<p>
The conference is preceded by <b>minicourses</b> on
Friday July 16 and
Saturday July 17, aimed to prepare non-experts, especially graduate
students and recent Ph.D.s, for the primary conference content.
The main workshop will also have an informal open afternoon discussion session.
As you plan your trip, also keep in mind the <b>activities</b>:
a group hike up Moosilauke on Sunday July 18, and hiking/kayaking
the Wednesday afternoon. Also see <a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/disab.php">accessibility</a>.

<p>
<b>Travel</b> directions for getting to Dartmouth campus are <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~maps/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~physics/about/directions.html">here</a>.
Boston's <a href="http://www.massport.com/logan">Logan Airport</a> has most connections, and is a 2-hour
drive, or a nearly 3-hour convenient bus ride door-to-door via
the <a href="http://www.dartmouthcoach.com/schedules.html">Dartmouth Coach</a>.
(The smaller Manchester, NH, and Burlington, VT, airports are closer but lack convenient public transport).
Once on campus
use the NW <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~maps/campus/close-ups/index.html">map</a> to locate <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~opdc/projects/kh/">Kemeny Hall</a>. Dartmouth Coach also runs a nice 5-hour bus from New York City.
