<p><b>Textbook:</b> Calculus, 7th Edition, by James Stewart (Brooks-Cole).  Wheelock Books has the standard student edition, without online access. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Cengage website you may also purchase the book with online access, get it in <a href="http://www.cengagebrain.com/shop/ISBN/9780538497817?cid=APL1">eBook form</a> or get a <a href="http://www.cengagebrain.com/shop/ISBN/9781133112716?cid=APL1">hybrid</a>, which is a physical text containing only the explanations and examples, with access to online exercises. <b>You do not need online access for required class assignments.</b>  <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Math 8 material is contained in chapters 7, 11, 12, 13, and 14 (which correspond to 8 and 12-15 in the 6th edition of Stewart).</p>

<p><b>Students with disabilities</b> enrolled in this course and who may need disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to see their instructor privately as early as possible in the term. Students requiring disability-related accommodations must register with the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~accessibility/">Student Accessibility Service</a> office. Once SAS has authorized accommodations, students must show the originally signed SAS Accommodations/Consent Form and/or a letter on SAS letterhead to their professor. As a first step, if students have questions about whether they qualify to receive accommodations, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions about accommodations will remain confidential.</p>

<p>For your convenience, here is the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/calendars/term/2011-09.html">term calendar</a> as set by the registrar, with deadlines for schedule adjustment and other significant dates.</p>


<h2>The Honor Principle</h2>

<p><b>On Exams</b>: No assistance may be given or received except that you may ask the instructor for clarification of a problem.  In particular, no calculators or computing devices may be used.</p>

<p><b>On Homework</b>: Collaboration and discussion is encouraged, and you may discuss problems with instructors, tutors, and fellow students, and use notes, books, calculators, and computing devices.  However, each student is to complete his or her assignments individually and independently.</p>


<h2>Lectures and Exams</h2>

<p>Lectures will be held Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, with x-hour used only if needed to replace a class.</p>

<center><b>If you have a conflict with a scheduled exam contact your instructor as soon as possible.</b></center>

<h2>Homework and Tutorials</h2>

<p><b>Homework</b> is online through the free system WeBWorK.  You will receive an email with your login information once the system has been set up; it will direct you to the <a href="https://webwork.dartmouth.edu/webwork2/m8f11/">login page for Math 8</a>.  For help see the <a href="https://webwork.dartmouth.edu/webwork-local/docs/students_FAQ.html">WeBWorK FAQ</a> and the <a href="https://webwork.dartmouth.edu/webwork-local/docs/available_functions.html">list of functions available in WeBWorK</a>.  Login names and passwords in WeBWorK are case-sensitive.</p>

<p>Note that WeBWorK requires precise syntax.  You have unlimited tries on each problem, so if you are certain you have done the problem correctly, check your parentheses and other syntax, and keep numbers inside square roots and other operations instead of using rounded-off decimal answers.  One common difficulty is viewing the mathematical symbols, which are embedded images; this is a browser incompatibility problem, but may be fixed by changing your display options on the left side of the screen from "images" to "formattedText" (and if that doesn't work, to "plainText").</p>

<p><b>Tutorials</b> are an additional resource for you to get help with the course.  Similarly to office hours, they are times set aside for you to come for assistance with material.  We have three teaching assistants, Dan Cianci, Nicolas Petit, and Ian Adelstein.</p>

<center><table class="info">
<tr><td><b>Tutorials:</b> Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday 7:00-9:00 PM<br/> except nights of midterms and Thanksgiving break<br /> <b>Kemeny 006</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Tutorials begin Thursday, September 22 <br /> and end Tuesday, November 29</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>Generally, homework will be due at midnight after the Thursday tutorial.</p>

<p>Finally, through the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/tutors/index.html">Academic Skills Center</a> you may join a study group or obtain a private tutor.</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>Grades will be assigned based on homework and exams as follows.</p>
