<h2>Graphing Resources</h2>

<p>David Lippman of Pierce College has made a <a href="http://dlippman.imathas.com/g1/GrapherLaunch.html">graphing applet</a> available (in either Javascript or non-Javascript form).  You may graph in 2D or 3D and rotate the graphs to view them from different angles.</p>

<p>If you have a Mac, you can use the Grapher program, located in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder.  Here are some files for sections 14.3 and 14.4: <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m8f11/grapher/tangent1.gcx">tangent1</a> and <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m8f11/grapher/tangent2.gcx">tangent2</a>.  Each of them features a different function and 7 equations related to that function.  In order, they are: the surface, the curve in the surface when y is fixed, the curve in the surface when x is fixed, the tangent line over the first curve, the tangent line over the second curve, the normal line to the surface, and the tangent plane.  In tangent1 the point of tangency is (1,0) and in tangent2 it is (1,1).</p>

<p>Another Grapher file: <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m8f11/grapher/absoluteextrema.gcx">absoluteextrema</a>.  This shows the image of the unit circle on the function to help visualize the absolute extrema of that function in the unit disk.</p>
