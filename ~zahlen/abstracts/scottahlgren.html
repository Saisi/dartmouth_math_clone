Abstract: Let p(n) denote the number of partitions of n
(for example, 3=2+1=1+1+1, so we have p(3)=3). A simple
question we might ask about p(n) (or about any arithmetic
function with integral values) is the number of its values
which are odd. The best answers to this question involve the
theory of modular forms. I will discuss recent results on
this (and related) problems.
