Abstract:  <br><br>I report on two recent results.  The first, with Greg Martin,
deals with primitive sets, namely sets of natural numbers where no
term divides another.  In 1935, Erdos showed that the sum of 1/(n log n)
over members larger than 1 of a primitive set is universally bounded.
We establish a near converse of this result showing that any smooth
growth condition for a counting function of a set which is compatible
with the Erdos theorem can be the order of magnitude for the counting
function of a primitive set.  This result improves slightly
on a similar construction of Ahlswede, Khachatrian, and Sarkozy in 1999.

The second result, with Andrzej Schinzel, deals with sets of residues mod n
that are ``product free," that is, there is no solution to ab=c in the set.
We conjecture that every product-free set of residues mod n has fewer than
n/2 members, and we prove this for all but a very small fraction of the natural
numbers.
