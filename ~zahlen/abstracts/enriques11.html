Abstract: Let $\chi$ be a non-principal Dirichlet character $\bmod{p}$ (where p is a prime). Let H be the maximum number of consecutive integers for which $\chi$ takes a particular value (i.e, \chi is constant in that interval). Burgess showed that H = O(p^(1/4)log p) in 1963. Norton claimed without proof that he could show H < 4.1p^{1/4}log p and if p>e^{15} then H< 2.5p^{1/4}log p. McGown recently posted on the arxiv a proof that H < 7.06p^{1/4}\log p if p > 5*10^{15} and H < 7 p^{1/4}\log p if p > 5*10^{55}.
I was able to improve McGown's result to be able to match (and improve) Norton's claims. We prove that H < 3 p^{1/4}\log p, and if p > 2.5*10^9 then H < 1.55 p^{1/4}log p (note we also prove that if p > e^{15} then H < 2.4 p^{1/4}log p).
In this talk we give a sketch of the proof of this result, mainly looking at the ideas that were used to be able to improve McGown's result.
