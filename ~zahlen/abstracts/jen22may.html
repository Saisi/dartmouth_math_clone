Abstract:  For a fixed genus g  how many isogenous elliptic curves can we find in the decomposition of the Jacobian variety of some
curve of that genus?  Given a curve X with automorphism group G, we use idempotent relations in the group ring Q[G] to decompose the Jacobian
variety J_X. Using these decompositions and some representation theory we can give at least partial answers to the question above for genus up to 10.
