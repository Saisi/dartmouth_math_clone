Let d>2 be an integer.  Relative to the usual representatives, any unit modulo d lies in the interval (0,d/2) or (d/2,d).  If H is a subgroup of the group of units modulo d, we say H is balanced if each coset of H intersects these two intervals equally.  There are two nice ways to construct fat families of balanced subgroups.  If H is a balanced subgroup belonging to neither of these two families, then H is sporadic.  In this talk, we will address the question: How sporadic are sporadic balanced subgroups?
