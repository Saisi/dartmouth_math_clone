A Diophantine quadruple is a set {a,b,c,d} of four positive integers
such that ab+1, ac+1, ad+1, bc+1, bd+1, and cd+1 are all perfect
squares. We derive an asymptotic formula for the number of Diophantine
quadruples whose elements are bounded by x. In doing so, we describe two
existing tools in analytic number theory and how we extended them. The
"Erdo"s-Tur‡n inequality" bounds the discrepancy between the number of
elements of a sequence that lie in a particular interval modulo 1 and
the expected number; we establish a version of this inequality where the
interval is allowed to vary. We also adapt an argument of Hooley on the
equidistribution of solutions of polynomial congruences to handle
reducible quadratic polynomials.
