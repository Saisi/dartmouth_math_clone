<p class="p1">Abstract: The Hasse Principle is an important concept in algebraic number theory
which binds global and local theories together.  In the context of
solving equations, it relates solvability of an equation defined over
the rationals to its solvability over the reals and over all the
p-adic fields.  The Hasse principle holds in many settings (e.g.
quadratic forms) as witnessed by important theorems:  Hasse-Minkowski,
Hasse Norm, Albert-Brauer-Hasse-Noether.  Well, you see where the name
of the principle comes from.  In a recent Monthly article,
counterexamples to the Hasse principle were discussed.  We describe
the Hasse principle, give examples, and then explore a famous
counterexample of Selmer.</p>
