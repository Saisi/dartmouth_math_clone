Abstract: In this expository talk, we will examine Davenport's papers on
asymptotics for the number of irreducible binary cubic forms of
discriminant up to X, as X tends to infinity.  This is achieved by
reducing the original problem to a lattice-point counting problem, and
then applying a "principle of Lipschitz".

Applications of this work include asymptotics for counting binary cubic
number fields, of Davenport and Heilbronn, and its generalizations by
Manjul Bhargava to counting $S_{4}$ quartic fields and $S_{5}$ quintic
fields.
