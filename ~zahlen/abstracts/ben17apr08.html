Abstract:  
<br><br>
A standard group action in complex analysis is that of SL_2(C) acting on the Riemann Sphere by linear fractional transformations. 
It's not difficult to show that this action is always transitive. What's more, if we replace C by some number field K, the same proof shows that the action of SL_2(K) on {K u \infty} is transitive.
Things change however, when we consider the action of SL_2(O_K) on {K u \infty}.

The goal of my talk will be to prove the following theorem:

<br>
<b>Theorem</b>: Let K be a number field with number ring O_K. Then the number of orbits of the action of SL_2(O_K) on {K u  \infty} is equal to the class number of K.
