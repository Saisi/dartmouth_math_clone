Abstract:Let d>2 be an integer.  Using the standard representatives, any unit mod d lies either in the interval (0,d/2) or (d/2,d).  A subgroup H of the group of units mod d is called balanced if every coset of H intersects these two intervals equally.  There are two nice families of such subgroups, and a balanced subgroup is calledsporadic if it is not included in either family.  For a fixed number g, we consider the distribution of d>2 coprime to g for which <g mod d> is sporadic balanced.  This relates to a conjecture of Carl Pomerance and Douglas Ulmer.
