<html>Abstract:  What is the determinant of a two-by-two matrix with entries in the quaternions? Expand along the first row? the first column? In general, the answers are different; which, if either, is correct? In this talk, we trace the development of determinants over the quaternions from 1845 (two years after Hamilton defined them) to the present, looking at the steps (and missteps) along the way to a well-defined notion of a determinant.</html>
