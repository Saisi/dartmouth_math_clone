<html>Abstract:  Cusp forms which are simultaneous eigenforms for
the family of Hecke operators provide a distinguished class
of modular forms. In particular, the Fourier coefficients of
such forms have nice arithmetic properties, and each such
form has an L-series which admits an Euler product. It is
well known that each simultaneous eigenform is associated to
a unique newform. We will give a characterization of all
simultaneous eigenforms associated to a given newform, and
give conditions under which the full space of cusp forms of
level N is spanned by a basis of simultaneous eigenforms.
