Abstract: ï»¿We use explicit methods for computing with quaternion algebras and the cohomology 
of Shimura curves to compute spaces of Hilbert modular forms. As a consequence, we 
construct nonsolvable finite extensions of the rational numbers ramified only at 3 and 5, respectively. 
This is joint work with Matthew Greenberg and Lassina Dembele.
