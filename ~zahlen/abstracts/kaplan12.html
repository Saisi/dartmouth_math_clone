A \emph{numerical semigroup} is an additive submonoid, say $S$, of the positive integers with finite complement.  The size of this complement  is called the \emph{genus} of the semigroup, denoted by $g(S)$, and the sum of the elements of this complement minus $g(S)(g(S)+1)/2$ is called the \emph{weight} of the semigroup, denoted $w(S)$.  These definitions come from the theory of Weierstrass semigroups of algebraic curves.  Given a numerical semigroup $S$ with smallest nonzero element $t$ we can construct a $t$-core partition from it of size equal to $g(S) + w(S)$.  The weight plus the genus of a semigroup can be expressed in terms of a certain inhomogeneous quadratic form in $t-1$ variables which is also related to the generating function for $t$-core partitions of $n$.  We focus on $t=5$, the smallest case for which the relevant results for quadratic forms are available.  We use this construction to strengthen the Granville-Ono result: we prove that for every $n\ge 6$ there exists a $5$-core partition of $n$ which comes from a numerical semigroup.  Equivalently, we show that for all $n \ge 6$ there exists a numerical semigroup $S$ with smallest nonzero element $5$ and $w(S) + g(S) = n$.  We conjecture that similar results hold for all $t\ge 5$.

For $t=5$ the form described above naturally leads to a certain quadratic form in $4$ variables related to a translate of the $A_4$ lattice.  The condition that the inputs come from a numerical semigroup leads us to consider only inputs that lie in a certain cone. The general theory of quadratic forms in four or more variables implies that the vectors of norm $N$ become equidistributed when projected to the unit sphere as $N$ goes to infinity.  In particular, for sufficiently large $N$ there must be a vector of norm $N$ which lies in our cone.  We adapt known techniques for proving equidistribution to get an explicit upper bound on the largest $N$ such that there is no vector of norm $N$ lying in this cone.  We
combine these techniques with direct computation to show that $N = 6$ is the largest exception.
