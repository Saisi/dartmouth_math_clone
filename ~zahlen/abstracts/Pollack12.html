A notorious problem in analytic number theory is to understand the distribution of squares modulo primes $p$. For example, if $n_2(p)$ denotes the least positive quadratic nonresidue modulo $p$, then Vinogradov conjectured that $n_2(p)$ is eventually smaller than $p^\epsilon$, for any fixed $\epsilon > 0$. We are far from proving this; the state-of-the art in this direction is a result of Burgess, now fifty years old, that any $\epsilon > (4\sqrt{e})^{-1}$ is permissible.

Instead of looking at the maximal order of $n_2(p)$, one might consider the average size of $n_2(p)$. This was determined by Erd\H{o}s in 1961: The mean value of $n_2(p)$ is the finite constant $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} p_k/2^k \approx 3.675$, where $p_k$ denotes the $k$th prime in increasing order. In this talk, we discuss some recently obtained extensions and generalizations of Erdos's result. In particular, we sketch a determination of the size of the the average least non-split prime in a cubic number field. Some of these results represent joint work with Greg Martin.</html>
