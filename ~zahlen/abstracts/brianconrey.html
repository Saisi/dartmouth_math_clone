Abstract: Understanding averages of the Riemann
zeta-function and other L-functions is important in analytic
number theory for a variety of reasons. However, it is only
in the last 10 years that we are beginning to understand the
structure of these averages. A big role in achieving this
understanding was played by physicists who study random
matrix theory. In this talk I will tell this story and
explain the crucial role played by the number 42.
