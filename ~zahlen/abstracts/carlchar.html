With number theory quals in mind, I will give a brief
introduction to Dirichlet characters and some applications.
The first lecture will introduce these characters and
discuss principal, induced, and primitive characters.
In addition, we will look at Gauss sums, which connect
multiplicative characters to additive characters.  In a future
lecture or lectures, I will prove the Polya--Vinogradov
inequality (for a sum of character values over an interval)
plus an application to primitive roots.  A resource for
the material up through Polya--Vinogradov is Davenport's
``Multiplicative number theory". </html>
