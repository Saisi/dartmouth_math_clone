Abstract: Let Omega(n) denote the number of prime factors of an integer n, counted with multiplicity. For example, Omega(20) = 3. After reviewing some classical results on the distribution of Omega, we turn to a discussion of Omega(F(n)), where F is a fixed polynomial with integer coefficients. We focus on what can be said about the maximal order of Omega(F(n)) -- in other words, how many prime factors can F(n) have, as a function of n?
