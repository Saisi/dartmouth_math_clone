 The pretentious view of analytic number theory, as developed by Granville and Soundararajan, is about finding an alternative approach for classical problems in number theory to the standard techniques relying on the zeros of L-functions.  The main objects of study are general multiplicative functions, with the idea that two multiplicative functions which are "close" in a precise sense should exhibit similar analytic properties.  Surprisingly, we find that this does not extend to the notion of power cancellation in partial sums, in that there are multiplicative functions which exhibit as much cancellation as possible, which, modified only slightly, give rise to functions which exhibit almost as little as possible.  We rectify this situation by defining two new notions of pretentiousness which do allow for detection of power cancellation.  In addition, we consider a question of extreme cancellation, completely classifying those functions in a natural class which exhibit more than expected cancellation.  This is joint work with Junehyuk Jung.</html>
