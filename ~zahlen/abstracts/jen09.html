Let p be an odd prime with A, d positive integers satisfying (d,
p-1)=1 and p not dividing A.  We would like to know when the map from Z\pZ to
Z\pZ sending x to Ax^d permutes the even residues (0, 2, 4, ..., p-1) mod p.  Goresky and Klapper
conjecture that for p > 13  this map permutes the even residues only when
A=d=1. This conjecture arises from an equivalent conjecture about a class of
binary sequences called l-sequences.  We will talk about how to use binomial
sum bounds to prove the Goresky-Klapper conjecture for any prime p > 2.26
x 10^55.
