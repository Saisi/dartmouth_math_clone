Between 1640 and 1654, Fermat discovered three beautiful theorems about the representation of odd primes $p$ by the forms $x^{2} + y^{2}$, $x^{2} + 2y^{2}$, and $x^{2} + 3y^{2}$.  Most primers of number theory prove the first theorem, which states that an odd prime $p$ is a sum of two squares if and only if $p = 4k+1$.  Naturally, Fermat tried to prove an analogous result about primes of the form $x^{2} + 5y^{2}$, but he was unsuccessful.

In this talk, I would like to present a unified approach to the problem of representation of integers by binary quadratic forms $q(x,y) = ax^{2} + bxy + cy^{2}$ due to Lagrange.  The novelty in his approach consists in the simultaneous consideration of all forms with a fixed discriminant $\Delta = b^{2} - 4ac$.  Working within this framework, Lagrange was able to prove the conjectures of Fermat and Euler about primes of the form $x^{2} + 5y^{2}$ and clarify the difficulties faced by his predecessors.

If time permits, I shall also give an introduction to genus theory and composition theory of Gauss, which are at the heart of Section V of his Disquisitiones.
