<p class="p1">Abstract: In their paper "Twists of newforms" Hijikata, Pizer and Shemanske examined the structure of the space generated by cuspidal newforms (of a fixed weight, level and character) and proved a number of theorems in which they showed how these spaces could be decomposed into direct sums of 'simpler' spaces. The main tool used to prove these theorems is the Eichler-Selberg trace formula. In this talk we will put the aforementioned results into historical context and then show how they may be extended to Hilbert modular forms.</p>
