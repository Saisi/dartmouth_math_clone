The problem of finding the primes p for which an integer a is a
primitive root modulo p has been of interest to mathematicians dating
back to Gauss. In 1927, Artin famously conjectured that, if a is not a
square and not -1, there are infinitely many primes with a as a
primitive root. We will discuss several approaches to this problem,
including the celebrated proof (conditional upon the Generalized
Riemann Hypothesis) due to Hooley.
