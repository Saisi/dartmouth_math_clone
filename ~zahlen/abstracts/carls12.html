For an integer n>  2, the unit group modulo n has an even number of elements, with half of them having representatives in (0,n/2) and the other half having representatives in (n/2,n).  It is "balanced".  Say a subgroup H of this unit group is "balanced" if each coset of H is evenly split between the bottom half and the top half.  Suppose g>1 is a fixed integer.  We are concerned with the distribution of numbers n coprime to g for which the cyclic subgroup<g>  in the unit group mod n is balanced. This has an application to the statistical study of the rank of the Legendre curve over function fields.  (Joint work with Douglas Ulmer.)
