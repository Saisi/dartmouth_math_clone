Abstract: The Euler phi-function and Carmichael lambda-
function are both determined at a positive integer n by the
structure of the unit group modulo n, which we denote U(n).
In particular, phi(n) is the order of U(n) while lambda(n)
is the exponent of U(n). Much is known about the
distribution of the values of phi and lambda for integers n
up to some bound x. We answer a number of the same questions
regarding the distribution of the values of U. Among other
results, we give an upper bound for the number of distinct
values U(n) for n up to x, and we address the natural unit
group analogue to Carmichael's Conjecture for phi.
Specifically, we show that there are infinitely many unit
groups U(n) for which n is the unique preimage under U.
