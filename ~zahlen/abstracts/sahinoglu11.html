<p class="p1"> In this talk I am going to describe a method that has been used by Rosen and Silverman to find a criteria on quadratic imaginary fields for the independence of Heegner points associated their maximal orders  on non-CM elliptic curves. This method does not apply to CM elliptic curves due to failure of Serre's theorem on the image of Galois. I will show how to compensate for Serre's theorem and derive the same criteria for independence of Heegner points on CM elliptic curves. I will also show how both results can be generalized to Heegner points associated to orders of a given conductor rather than the maximal orders. If there's time left I will talk about independence of Darmon's conjectural Heegner points and some future directions. I will start with the definitions of complex multiplication (CM) and Heegner points so the talk will be accessible to everyone in Number Theory. </p>
