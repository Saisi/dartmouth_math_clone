Abstract:  A familiar concept in elementary number theory
and algebra, Euler's function at n is the order of the
unit group in the ring of integers mod n.  It is a surprisingly
rich source of interesting problems, some of them still
unsolved.  For example, is it always at least 2 to 1 as
a mapping from the natural numbers to themselves?  What
is the computational complexity of computing Euler's function?
Is there an asymptotic formula for the distribution of
its range?  These, and many more problems and results
will be discussed.
