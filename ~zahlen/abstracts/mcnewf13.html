The problem of looking for subsets of the natural numbers which contain no 3-term arithmetic progressions has a rich history.
Roth's theorem famously shows that any such subset cannot have positive upper density.
In contrast, Rankin in 1960 suggested looking at subsets without geometric progressions, and constructed such a subset with asymptotic density about 0.719.
More recently, several authors have found upper bounds for the upper density of such sets.
We significantly improve upon these upper bounds, and demonstrate a method of constructing sets with a greater upper density than Rankin's set.
This construction is optimal in the sense that this method gives a way of effectively computing the greatest possible upper density of a geometric-progression-free set.
Finally, we show that geometric progressions mod N behave more like Roth's theorem in that one cannot take any fixed positive proportion of the integers modulo a sufficiently large value of N while avoiding geometric progressions.
