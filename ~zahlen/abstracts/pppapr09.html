For a natural number n, write sigma(n) for the sum of the positive
divisors of n. The ancient Greeks called n deficient, perfect, or
abundant, depending  on whether sigma(n)/n was smaller than, equal, or
larger than 2 (respectively). In  this talk we discuss some problems
motivated by this ancient classification. Much of this talk will be a
survey of existing results and methods, but in the last part of the talk
we will discuss some new results on how close the  fraction sigma(n)/n
is to being in lowest terms.
