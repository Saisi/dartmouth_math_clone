Let f(n) be the sum of the reciprocals of the primes dividing the Mersenne numbers.
Erdos proved that f(n) &le; logloglog(n)+C for some constant C.
Apart from the exact value of C, it is easy to show that this result is best possible.
Although it would be more interesting to understand the maximal order, the function f(n) is more tractable, albeit still difficult.
In this talk, we consider Erdos's question on the exact value of the constant C, as well as functions which generalize f(n).
