The Katz-Sarnak philosophy asserts that to any "naturally defined
family" of L-functions, there should be an associated symmetry group
which determines the distribution of the low-lying zeros of those
L-functions.  We consider the family of Dedekind zeta functions of
cubic number fields, and we predict that the associated symmetry group
is symplectic.  To analyze the low-lying zeros of this family, we
start by using (as is standard in these types of problems) a variant
of the explicit formula used by Riemann to study the Riemann zeta
function.  This reduces the problem to understanding the distribution
of how rational primes split in cubic fields of absolute discriminant
X, as X tends to infinity.  This can be analyzed by using the work of
H. Davenport and H. Heilbronn on the asymptotics of the number of
cubic fields as the absolute discriminant tends to infinity.  The
final ingredient is a recent result of K. Belabas, M. Bhargava, and
C. Pomerance on power-saving error terms in the count of cubic fields
considered by Davenport and Heilbronn.
