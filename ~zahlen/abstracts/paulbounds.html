In 1959, Wirsing showed that the number of perfect numbers N <= x is
bounded by x^{W/log log x} for all x > 1 and a certain absolute
constant W. This remains the best known bound on the counting function
of the set of perfect numbers. We discuss Wirsing's ideas and use them
to bound the number of odd perfect numbers with a given number of
prime factors.
