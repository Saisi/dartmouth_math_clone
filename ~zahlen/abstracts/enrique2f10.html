Abstract: In this talk, we prove that for any positive fundamental discriminant $D > 1596$, there is always at least one prime $p \leq D^{0.45}$ such that the Kronecker symbol $(D/p) = -1$. We use a ``smoothed'' version of the P\'olya-Vinogradov inequality, which is very useful for explicit estimates.
