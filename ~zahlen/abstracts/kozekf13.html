Erdos used a covering system to construct an infinite set of counterexamples to a conjecture of de Polignac's about odd numbers that could be represented as the sum of a prime and a power of 2.
We present recent work with undergraduates that involves Erdos covering systems.
We construct composite numbers in different bases that remain composite after changing any digit in their base-b expansions.
We construct Riesel-Sierpinski numbers of special forms.
We attempt Erdos's minimum modulus problem and a related conjecture of Krukenberg's.
We include recent, related results of Tao, Konyagin, Hough, Pomerance, Luca, and others, and we describe our current research about Erdos covering systems.
<b>NOTE:</b> This talk is accessible to graduate students and likely to advanced undergraduates who have taken courses in number theory.
