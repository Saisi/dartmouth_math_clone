A well-known construction associates to an order in a quaternion
algebra (defined over a totally real number field) a hyperbolic
surface. In 1980 Vigneras used this construction in order to prove the
existence of hyperbolic surfaces which were isospectral (have the same
spectrum with respect to the Laplace-Beltrami operator) but not
isometric. Key to Vigneras' method was a characterization of the
values contained in the spectrum of an arithmetic manifold as
embedding numbers of certain rank two commutative orders into
quaternion orders. After discussing a few recent developments in the
embedding theory of quaternion orders we will report on two results.

The first, joint with Peter Doyle and John Voight, deals with explicit
examples of isospectral but not isometric hyperbolic surfaces. The
example appearing in Vigneras' original paper was a pair of manifolds
of genus 100801. We will exhibit substantially simpler examples: a
pair of genus 6 manifolds and a pair of orbifolds whose underlying
surface has genus 1. Further, we will show that these examples are
best possible using Vigneras' method.

The second result concerns isospectral towers of Riemannian manifolds;
that is, towers of finite covers of Riemannian manifolds which are
isospectral but not isometric at every stage. We show that for every n
>= 2 there exist arbitrarily large families of isospectral towers of
Riemannian n-manifolds. As was the case with the first result, our
proof is almost entirely number theoretic.
