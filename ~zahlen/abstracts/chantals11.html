<p class="p1">Abstract: Let E be an elliptic curve over Q. For all primes p not dividing the discriminant, E reduces to an elliptic curve over the finite field F_p. Let N_p(E) be the order of the group of points E(F_p). In 1988 Neal Koblitz conjectured a precise asymptotic for the number of primes p up to x such that N_p(E) is prime, which is an analogue of elliptic curves of the Hardy-Littlewood twin prime conjecture. As the twin prime conjecture, Koblitz's conjecture is still open, but one can use sieve techniques to show that N_p(E) is almost-prime for many primes under the GRH.</p>

<p class="p1">We also discuss the related question of counting pseudo-primes among the sequence of orders N_p(E), generalizing some of the literature for classical pseudo-primes to this new setting, under the GRH and an additional hypothesis about the number of reductions of elliptic curves over F_p with a fixed number of points. This last question is very natural, but interestingly nno results are known besides the trivial bound.</p>
