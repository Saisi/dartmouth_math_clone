<html>Abstract:  Item 3 under the analytic part of the number
theory qual syllabus states that the Riemann zeta-function
is something good to know for the qual. In particular, it
lists: Poisson summation, analytic continuation, the
functional equation for the zeta function, zeros of the zeta
function, trivial, non-trivial, Riemann Hypothesis.

I will attempt to cover these topics.

This talk is based on material drawn from a variety of
sources, which I collected together as notes when I studied
for my own number theory qual.</html>
