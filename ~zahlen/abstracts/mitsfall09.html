Abstract: Following terminology from antiquity, a natural number is said to be
abundant if it is smaller than the sum of its proper divisors. Since
Davenport, we know the abundant numbers have a positive asymptotic
density, and from Behrend we know that this density is between
$0.24$ and $0.32$. Henri Cohen asked if it could be determined
whether it is less than, equal to, or more than $1/4$. This was
settled by Del\'eglise when he computed that it is $0.247\dots$. We
will discuss recent improvements to the algorithm of Del\'eglise
which allows us to discover the next decimal digit.
