Abstract:  
Burgess wrote a series of papers giving inexplicit bounds for short character sums where the Polya-Vinogradov inequality is trivial. The Burgess bound is useful to compute L(1, \chi) and give bounds for the least quadratic nonresidue. Iwaniec and Kowalski provide explicit bounds. Booker gives better bounds for quadratic characters in restricted ranges. I widen the range in Booker's results without cost to his constants and I also get explicit bounds for any non-quadratic character.
