An expander graph is one with small diameter: one can get
from any vertex to another with a short path, a desirable property for
the purposes of network communications, for example.  The first
explicit constructions of such graphs were given by Ihara,
Lubotzky-Phillips-Sarnak, and Margulis.  In this talk, we describe a
generalized construction arising from Hilbert modular forms, and an
application to computing ideal classes in definite quaternion orders.
This is joint work with Markus Kirschmer.
