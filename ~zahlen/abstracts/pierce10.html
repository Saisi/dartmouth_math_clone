Abstract: An old conjecture of Hardy and Littlewood posits that on
average, the number of representations of a positive integer N as a sum
of k, k-th powers is "very small." Counting the number of such
representations for a fixed integer N is out of reach of the classical
circle method, since the number of variables is not sufficiently large
with respect to the degree. Technically, studying the average number of
such representations should be easier, as this average can be expressed
as a mean value of Weyl sums. Nevertheless, the full conjecture of Hardy
and Littlewood appears intractable with current methods, and remains
unproved except for the case k=2. Recently, it has been observed that
the Hardy and Littlewood conjecture is actually equivalent to a certain
property of an operator in harmonic analysis, a discrete fractional
integral operator. This talk will describe this striking correspondence
between a problem in harmonic analysis and the original number theoretic
problem, and show how number theoretic methods, in particular the circle
method and mean values of Weyl sums, can be used to say something new in
analysis.</html>
