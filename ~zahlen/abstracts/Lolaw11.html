Abstract:<br><br>
There are two types of "ranks" associated with an elliptic curve: the Mordell-Weil rank, which comes from the algebraic structure of the group of rational points on an elliptic curve; and the analytic rank, which comes from the order of the zero of the L-function associated with an elliptic curve at s = 1. The famous Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture states that these ranks should coincide.

In this talk, we will discuss an important consequence of the BSD, known as the Parity Conjecture, and demonstrate some related computations that are now possible in Sage. The content of this talk is based on work from the Sage Days 22: Elliptic Curves workshop held at MSRI. No prior knowledge of elliptic curves or familiarity with Sage will be assumed.
