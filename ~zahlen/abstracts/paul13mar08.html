Abstract:  In 1772, Euler observed that the polynomial
x2+x+41 is a remarkably rich source of primes, yielding
prime values for every integer value of x from 0 to 39. A
satisfying algebraic explanation for this fact was advanced
by Rabinowitsch, who showed that Euler's observation is
essentially equivalent to a certain ring (namely, the ring
of integers of Q(sqrt(-163)) possessing unique
factorization. We outline an elementary (i.e., non
ideal-theoretic), geometric proof of Rabinowitsch's theorem,
due to Gyarmati and Zaupper. We conclude with a discussion
of principal ideal domains that are not Euclidean domains.
