Abstract: In a seminar I gave in winter term I mentioned a
theorem that describes those n for which the only group of
order n is cyclic; the condition is that n and phi(n) are
coprime. I also mentioned the theorem of Erdos that gives an
asymptotic formula for the distribution of such numbers n.
In this talk I'll discuss the proof of the Erdos theorem,
plus some recent extensions. The Erdos proof will get us
into some of the standard tools of elementary--analytic
number theory, including Brun's sieve method.
