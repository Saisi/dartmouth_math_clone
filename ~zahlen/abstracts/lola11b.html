A polynomial is a product of distinct cyclotomic polynomials if and only if it is a divisor over Z[x] of x^n-1 for some positive
integer n. In this talk, we will examine two natural questions concerning the divisors of x^n-1: ``For a given n, how large can the
coefficients of divisors of x^n-1 be?'' and ``How often does x^n-1 have a divisor of every degree between 1 and n?'' We will consider the
latter question when x^n-1 is factored in both Z[x] and F_p[x].
