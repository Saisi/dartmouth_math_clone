<p class="p1">Abstract: In his thesis, Weisinger developed a newform theory for Eisenstein series. This theory was later generalized to the Hilbert modular setting by Wiles. We extend the theory of newforms for Hilbert Eisenstein series. In particular we will show that Hilbert Eisenstein newforms are uniquely determined by their Hecke eigenvalues for any set of primes having Dirichlet density greater than 1/2. Additionally, we will provide a number of applications of this newform theory. This is joint work with Tim Atwill. </p>
