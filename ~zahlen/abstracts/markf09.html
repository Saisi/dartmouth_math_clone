We study certain closed horocyclic orbits on \Gamma(1)\H defined using the pencil of horocycles whose common point (in the words of the Nielsen-Fenchel manuscript) is infinity. The goal of this work is to obtain explicit answers to questions of this sort: If we are exactly here, now, going in this direction when precisely shall we be precisely there, going in that direction?
