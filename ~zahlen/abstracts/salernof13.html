 Multiple zeta functions are a multivariate version of the Riemann zeta function.
There are many open problems concerning these values, for example, it's not even known if these numbers are rational or even algebraic (although it is strongly suspected that they are transcendental).
However, these values satisfy many interesting algebraic relations between them.
A new approach to understanding multiple zetas is to study purely their algebraic structure.
I will talk about a few spaces (which turn out to have the nice structure of a Lie algebra) that are essentially equivalent to a formal version of these zetas, and where all the interesting questions turn into combinatorial questions.
