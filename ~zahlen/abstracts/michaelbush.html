Abstract: Maximal $p$-extensions with restricted
ramification are a much studied class of objects in modern
number theory. In this talk I will describe some of the
things we know and don't know about the Galois groups of
such extensions. In particular, I will describe some recent
work by Labute and others on mild pro-p Galois groups. The
talk should be accessible to graduate students in number 
theory.
