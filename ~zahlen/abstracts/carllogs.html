This talk will introduce the concept of discrete logarithm,
giving some elementary examples and algorithms.  A
cryptographic application will be given, motivating the desire
for particularly difficult cases.
These are currently afforded by elliptic curves, so they will
be discussed as well as some efforts to use special properties
of elliptic curves so as to break the system.
