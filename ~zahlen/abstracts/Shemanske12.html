To most of us, the introduction to algebraic number theory comes
via a definition of the ring of integers of a number field, or
perhaps through the general notion of a Dedekind ring.  But there is
a much broader theory of orders that I would like to introduce
briefly before retreating to the comfort of orders in a number
field.  Once there, I will talk about obstructions to the ring of
integers having a power basis, and why one should care.
