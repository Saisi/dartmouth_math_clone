Abstract:Lehmer's totient problem asks if there exist composite integers n satisfying the condition phi(n)|n-1, (where phi is the Euler-phi function) while Carmichael numbers satisfy the weaker condition lambda(n)|n-1 (where lambda is the Carmichael universal exponent function). We weaken the condition further, looking at those composite n where each prime divisor of phi(n) also divides n-1. While these numbers appear to be far more numerous than the Carmichael numbers, we show that their distribution has the same rough upper bound as that of the Carmichael numbers, a bound which is heuristically tight.</html>
