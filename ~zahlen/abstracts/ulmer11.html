<p class="p1"> Abstract:  Let K be function field k(t) and K<sub>d</sub>=k(t<sup>1/d</sup>) where k is a finite field and d is prime to p=char(k). Let E be the Legendre elliptic curve y2=x(x+1)(x+t) over K.  It turns out that one can compute the rank of E(K<sub>d</sub>) for all d and also prove that the Tate-Shafarevich group &#x0428;(E/K<sub>d</sub>) is finite for all d.  For some d one may even compute the group structure of &#x0428;(E/K<sub>d</sub>).  These computations are in terms of invariants of the subgroup of (Z/dZ)* generated by p and are of a somewhat combinatorial flavor.  Analyzing the formulas (e.g., determining the set of d for which the rank is non-zero or determining average behavior as d varies) looks challenging.  I'll explain how to compute the rank and the structure of &#x0428; and pose several problems. </p>
