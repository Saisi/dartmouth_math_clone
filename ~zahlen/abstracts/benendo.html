Abstract: Let E be an elliptic curve over a field k. Then End(E) is either isomorphic to the integers,
an order in an imaginary quadratic field extension of Q, or an order in a rational quaternion algebra ramified at a finite prime p and at infinity. I will prove this theorem and talk about which of these alternatives arise when k is the complex numbers, an arbitrary field of characteristic zero, or
a field of positive characteristic.
