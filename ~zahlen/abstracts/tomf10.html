 Abstract:<br><br>  A congruent number is an integer which is the area of a
right triangle whose sides all have rational lengths.  So 6 is a
congruent number as the area of a 3-4-5 right triangle.  But 5 is also
a congruent number as is 157.  What do these have to do with
Pythagorean triples and rational points on curves? Fermat's Last
theorem even makes a brief appearance as part of the discussion.

This is a warm up for an undergraduate talk I am to give on this topic
on Monday, so it will be quite elementary, but still a pretty
confluence of ideas.  At the end, we may address deeper connections.
