Let K be a number field and B be a central simple algebra defined over K. In 1932, Albert, Brauer, Hasse and Noether explicitly characterized the finite extensions L of K which may be embedded into B. An integral refinement immediately suggests itself: given an order $\Omega\subset \mathcal{O}_L$ and a maximal order M of B, when does there exist an embedding of $\Omega$ into M? This question turns out to be more subtle. In the case that B is a quaternion algebra satisfying the Eichler condition, Chinburg and Friedman have shown that the proportion of isomorphism classes of maximal orders of B admitting an embedding of $\Omega$ is either 0,1/2 or 1. Arenas-Carmona considered a broad class of higher rank central simple algebras and determined the maximal orders admitting an embedding of $\mathcal{O}_L$. We consider central simple algebras of dimension p^2 for p an odd prime and show that arbitrary commutative orders $\Omega$ in a degree p extension of K embed into none, all or exactly one out of every p isomorphism classes of maximal orders. The maximal orders admitting an embedding of $\Omega$ are explicitly characterized using the Bruhat-Tits building for SL_p.</p>
