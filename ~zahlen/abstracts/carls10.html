Abstract: This inequality involves the sum of character values as the variable runs over an interval. Discovered independently by Polya and Vinogradov in 1918, it has many interesting applications.  In this talk I will review what characters are and talk about some new developments including a "smoothed" version that is surprisingly elegant and has a simple proof. Some of this work is joint with Mariana Levin and K. Soundararajan.
