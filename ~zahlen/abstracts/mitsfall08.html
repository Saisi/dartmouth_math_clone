Abstract: Ancient Greek mathematicians were fond of numbers whose whole is exactly
the sum of its parts, that is, numbers such as 6 whose proper divisors
sum to the number itself.  So much so that they called these numbers
perfect.  Despite years of study, we still do not know much about the
distribution of perfect numbers.  In this talk we will look at
generalizations of perfect numbers, the amicable and sociable numbers,
and see what we now know about the distribution of these numbers.
