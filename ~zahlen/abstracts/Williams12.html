While the conjugacy classes of GL_n are straightforward to understand, those of GSp_{2g} are more challenging.  We have identified the conjugacy classes of GSp_4(Z/ell) and are interested in using them to determine and understand the classes of GSp_4(Z/ell^r).  With this information we can give a new interpretation of the Euler factors of L-functions of abelian quartic CM fields.  In 2003, Gekeler considered the proportion of elements of GL_2(Z/ell^r) with given characteristic polynomial and found a relationship to the Euler factors of the L-function of a quadratic imaginary field, which is related via the class number to the size of an isogeny class of elliptic curves.  Our results for GSp_4(Z/ell^r) extend this heuristic from elliptic curves to abelian surfaces.
