<html>Abstract: Humankind (more accurately, a tiny subset thereof)
has long been concerned with unlocking the mysteries of the
primes. In the 19th century, substantial progress was made
on such questions by analytic methods, leading to proofs of
Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions and
the celebrated prime number theorem. And as we heard in Dan
Goldston's Kemeny lectures last week, prime number theory
continues to be an active and fruitful area of modern
research. Nevertheless, many of the most natural and
innocent-sounding questions (such as the twin prime
conjecture) remain unanswered. I will discuss what is known
about some of these problems if we replace the ring of
integers by the ring of polynomials over a finite field. </html>
