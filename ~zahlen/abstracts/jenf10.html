Abstract:  The Coleman integral is an analytic tool that serves as the
p-adic analogue of the usual real-valued line integral. The theory of
Coleman integration plays a prominent role in the arithmetic of curves
and abelian varieties, allowing us to find torsion and rational points
and giving us a means to compute p-adic heights and regulators. We
describe algorithms for computing Coleman integrals on hyperelliptic
curves as well as some applications of these algorithms. Throughout,
we illustrate our methods with numerical examples, computed using our
implementation in Sage.
