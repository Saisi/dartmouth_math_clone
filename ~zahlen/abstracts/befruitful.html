Abstract: We give a detailed exposition of G. Rousseau's
proof of the law of quadratic reciprocity, which is arguably
the most memorable and natural of the (very many) elementary
proofs. No prior knowledge of number theory is assumed and
the talk should be accessible to anyone familiar with
abstract algebra.
