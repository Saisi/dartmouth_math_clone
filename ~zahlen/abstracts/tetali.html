Abstract: Motivated by the analysis of the Pollard Rho algorithm for the discrete
logarithm
problem, we develop a birthday theorem regarding self-intersections of
Markov chains with
uniform stationary distribution. As an application we show that a
collision occurs in
\Theta(\sqrt{|G|}) steps of the Rho algorithm for finding the discrete
log in a cyclic
group G. Time permitting, I will describe current work on extensions to
the more
practically relevant Kangaroo algorithm. This is based on joint papers
with Jeong Han
Kim, Ravi Montenegro, and Yuval Peres.
