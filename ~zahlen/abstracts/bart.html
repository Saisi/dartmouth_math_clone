Since the proof the Fermat's Last Theorem the ABC conjecture has
    come to be viewed as the holy grail of number theory. The conjecture
    itself is an asymptotic statement that seems to be completely out of
    reach of present techniques. In this talk we report on progress in
    its heuristic analysis, and on computational efforts to analyze
    small ABC triples.
