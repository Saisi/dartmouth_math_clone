Abstract:  
<br><br>
In this second talk, we define and study split orders in higher rank matrix algebras. We give a characterization of the orders in terms of geometric properties of affine buildings, which generalizes in a natural way the geometric interpretation as geodesics in the rank 2 case of the tree. Necessary elements from the first talk will be quickly reviewed making this talk self-contained.
