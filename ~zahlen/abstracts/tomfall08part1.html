Abstract:  
<br><br>
The ring of integers of a number field is a natural generalization of
the rational integers to finite extensions of Q, and maximal orders in
matrix algebras are a further generalization to the noncommutative
setting.  Unlike their commutative counterparts, maximal orders in
matrix algebras are not uniquely determined.
<br> <br>
In this first of two talks, we study the collection of maximal orders
in the ring of 2X2 matrices (over a local field) by constructing a
graph whose vertices are the maximal orders, with edges determined by
a notion of distance between maximal orders.  We show that this graph
is actually a tree.  At the end of the talk, we introduce a class of
nonmaximal orders called split orders and give a geometric
characterization in terms of the tree.
<br> <br>
A large part of this first talk is dedicated to defining the objects
of study which will include basic definitions such as localization and
p-adic numbers for those first-year students who come.
