<p class="p1">Abstract: To study the arithmetic properties of a curve over the field Q of rational numbers, one usually needs to understand first the properties of the reduction modulo p or the curve. When an elliptic curve has bad reduction modulo p, one attaches to it a small finite abelian group whose order is called the Tamagawa number of the curve at p. I will review these concepts and discuss properties of the Tamagawa numbers when the curve is assumed to have a non-trivial torsion point defined over Q.</p>
