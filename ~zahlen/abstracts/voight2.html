Abstract: A ring of rank n is an associative ring with identity that is free of rank n 
as a module over the integers ZZ (i.e. is isomorphic to ZZ^n as an abelian group). 
Bhargava and others have studied and classified commutative rings of rank at most 5. 
We consider the case where the ring is no longer (necessarily) commutative but possesses a standard involution. 
We characterize such rings by their degree, discuss the 
relationship to quaternion rings and ternary quadratic forms 
(due to Gross and Lucianovic), and provide a generalization to an arbitrary base ring.
