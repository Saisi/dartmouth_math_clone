<html>Abstract:  Given a polynomial $f \in Z[x]$ of degree $d>1$ and a large)
prime $p$, we may regard $f$ as a map from $Z/pZ$ into
$Z/pZ$. In many aspects, this "image of $f$ modulo $p$"
lacks any particular structure, and it is natural to model
it by the image of a random map from $Z/pZ$ into $Z/pZ$. For
example, if $f(x)=x2$, then the "probability" that a random
element $t \in Z/pZ$ is contained in the image is roughly
$1/2$. Further, by a result due to Davenport, the
probability that $t+1,t+2\ldots, t+k$ are all in the image
is (roughly) $2^{-k}$, so in some sense the image of $f$
modulo $p$ behaves as if it was generated by coin tosses.
For "generic" polynomials of higher degree, similar results
can be shown using the Riemann hypothesis for curves over
finite fields (together with some results inspired by
geometric Galois theory.) However, what can be said about
non-generic polynomials?</html>
