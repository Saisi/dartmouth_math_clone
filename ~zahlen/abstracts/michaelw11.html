 Abstract:<br><br>  In 1744, Euler made two conjectures on the representation of primes by the form x^2 + 5y^2.  Lagrange's proof of these conjectures in 1773 contains germs of the ideas of genus theory and composition of binary quadratic forms.  Using this proof as a starting point, I will explain (following Gauss) how we can endow the set of equivalence classes of binary quadratic forms with a group structure. This in turn will induce a group structure on the genera.
