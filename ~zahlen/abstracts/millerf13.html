Surprisingly, the class number of cyclotomic fields has only been determined for fields of rather small conductor, due to the difficulty of finding the "plus part" of the class number, i.e. the class number of the maximal real subfield. For example, prior to our recent work, the class number of the real cyclotomic fields of prime conductor had only been calculated for primes up to 67. By studying the prime ideals of the field, we establish class number upper bounds, allowing us to determine the class number for real cyclotomic fields of larger conductor than has been previously possible.
