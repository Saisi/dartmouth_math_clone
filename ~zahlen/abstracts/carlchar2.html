Brizolis has asked if for every prime p>3 there is a primitive
root g for p and an integer a in the range 1 to p-1 such that
g^{a} and a are congruent mod p.  Put another way, the
residue a might be thought of as a fixed point for the discrete
log function with base g.  In this talk I will use the Polya--Vinogradov
inequality to prove the Brizolis conjecture for all sufficiently
large primes p. </html>
