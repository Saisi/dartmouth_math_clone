Primality testing is one of many interesting applications of our study of elliptic curves. In this talk, I will discuss a few examples of primality tests and their run times, focusing on the Goldwasser-Kilian elliptic curve primality test.
No prior knowledge of time bounds or primality testing will be assumed, so this talk should be accessible to everyone.
