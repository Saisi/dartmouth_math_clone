<p class="p1">Abstract:  In a recent paper, we considered integers n for which the polynomial xn-1 has a divisor in Z[x] of every degree up to n, and we gave upper and lower bounds for their distribution. In this talk, we will discuss some new work in which we consider those n for which the polynomial xn-1 has a divisor in Fp[x] of every degree up to n, where p is a rational prime. </p>
