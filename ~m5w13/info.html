<B><U><P>Math Tutor</U>:</B> <A HREF="mailto:Amanda.J.Cahoy@Dartmouth.EDU">Amanda Cahoy</A> will hold regular tutorials on  Tuesday and Thursday 7:00-8:00 in Silsby Room 113 to help you with the math homework as well as to conduct "math review sessions" before exams. The tutorials are strictly for your convenience, to help you learn the math. Drop by sometime, especially if you have a question.</P>

<B><U><P>General organization</U>:</B> </P> <P>The class will meet three days a week. Two of these meetings will follow a seminar/lecture format, for the most part alternating between humanities and mathematics. The Friday session will usually revolve around student presentations and joint presentations by the instructors to bridge gaps across disciplines. The list of student presentation topics for Friday discussions will be announced and circulated for sign-up by the second week of the term.  All students should review the topics for the Friday Discussion before coming to class.</P>

<B><U><P>Guidelines for Student Presentations</U>:</B> </P> <P>Student presentations will be in groups of 3-4 students. Each group will be expected to hand in a Power Point presentation indicating individual contributions of each member. Each student will receive an individual grade for the overall presentation based on four components: content, presentation, questions and answers. See the Honor Principle section below for additional relevant information. 

<B><U><P>Course Website</U>:</B> </P> <P>The address of the <I>CL 65/Math 5,
Winter 2013 - A Matter of Time</I> website is <A
HREF="index.html">http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m5w13/</A>.
We will use it as an integral part of the course, so you definitely should check
it out right away and add it to your bookmarks.</P> 

<B><U><P>Assignments and
grades</U>:</P> </B><P>In addition to completing all reading assignments and math assignments by the due-date, students will be expected to: 
<ul>
<li>give presentations on Fridays.
<li>participate actively in class discussions. 
<li>write two short double-spaced papers, the first paper one page long and the second two pages, on topics that will be listed on the syllabus in weeks 1 and 8. 
<li>complete three in-class exams (one each in weeks four, seven and eight). The first two will be one-hour math multiple choice exams. The third one will be a one-hour short-questions essay exam. The questions will draw on material from the textbook and the reader. 
<li>write a final paper.  The final will be a five-to-six-page double-spaced <A HREF="Final Exam W13 & Grading Key.pdf">library research paper</A> on a choice of assigned topics, due on the first day Monday March 11 of final examinations. 
</ul>
Each one of the two math exams will be worth 50 points. The short essay question exam will be worth 100 points.The final paper will be worth 200 points; the Friday presentation 50 points; weekly math problems 50 points; the two short papers 20 and 30 points respectively; and class participation 50 points for an overall total of 600 points.</P>

<P>Each problem in each math homework assignment will be checked and a score from 0-5 will be assigned to the overall homework set according to the following holistic scale:
<ul>
<li>5 Substantially correct and complete.</li>
<li>4 A few minor errors, but he/she knows what he/she is doing.</li>
<li>3 Is usually on the right track, but has difficulty completing a problem.</li>
<li>2 Several blunders or conceptual errors. Is rarely on the right track. But knows how to get started.</li>
<li>1 Little to show.</li>
<li>0 Nothing worthwhile to show. Does not even write out relevant definitions and theorems consistently or correctly.</li>
</ul>
 

<B><U><P>Meetings with your instructors</U>:</P> </B><P>You should not hesitate to contact either one of your instructors about issues related to the course. You can send e-mail messages to us, make appointments, or drop into our scheduled office hours.</P> 

<B><U><P>Academic Honor Principle</U>:</P></B> 
<P><B>On in-class exams:</B> As you prepare for an exam, feel free to brainstorm with fellow students, and the tutor, or your instructors. During the taking of the exam itself, no help is to be given or received.</P>
<P><B>On homework, the final paper:</B> Feel free to brainstorm with fellow students, the tutor, or your instructors. However, when it comes to writing your paper (or any other materials for submission), you must do so by yourself without outside assistance and in your own words. In this regard, it is a violation of the Honor Principle to share electronic files or notes, or to participate in editing a joint document. You must produce by yourself the paper written for submission.</P>
<P><B> On the Friday student presentations:</B> These will be done by groups of 3-4 students. They will work collaboratively, each doing his or her part, and then combining materials into a coherent powerpoint document for submission. The latter will most probably entail the sharing of electronic files. Each student will get an individual grade.<DIR>

<P>
<b><u>Students' Religious Observances</u>:</b> <P>Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term.  If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with your instructor before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.

<P>
<b><u>Flu or Another Serious Illness</u>:</b> <P>If you contract a flu or other serious illness, please contact your professor by email.  I will be happy to make arrangements for you to make up late work, or exams if you provide me with a note from Dick's house.  Please do not come to class if you have a flu or an influenza-like illness. The Math 35 website will contain the complete class schedule, so you will know what you've missed.  For more information on what to do if you believe you have a flu, see the <A HREF="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~prepare/common_hazards/influenza_and_illness.html">Dartmouth web page </A>devoted to this topic.  

<P>
<b><u>Disabilities</u>:</b> <P>We encourage students with documented disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities such as chronic diseases, learning disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities, to discuss possible accommodations with your instructor. Students might want to consult as well Student Accessibility Services, 301 Collis Center, ext. 6-2014. In addition to providing information and services, the office can assist with determining appropriate accomodations and registering them.
