<h3>About the Authors</h3>

<b>Don Kreider</b>, Emeritus Professor of Mathematics, and <b>Dwight Lahr</b>, Professor of Mathematics, have taught mathematics at Dartmouth for many years. During that time, they have both taken an interest in innovative uses of the computer in the classroom. The main goal of the curricular reform of calculus they have been involved in is to make calculus more connected to other disciplines, and to make it come alive in a snappy and stimulating manner. They believe that students should be active learners, and that their task as teachers is to create opportunities for interactions that are fun. 
<p>
<b>Suan Diesel</b>, Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Norwich University, teaches all levels of undergraduate mathematics.  In addition to contributing to Principles of Calculus Modeling, she has written articles about math and science and has worked for software companies that develop Internet browser technology and mathematical software.

This particular work on calculus has been supported in part by the National Science Foundation through its Mathematics Across the Curriculum Project at Dartmouth, and by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.
