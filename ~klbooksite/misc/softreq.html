          To use the electronic pages corresponding to the sections of the textbook by Kreider, Lahr, and Diesel you must have the following software installed on your computer. 
          All of it is free, but you should be sure that you have it before you 
          interact with the pages. These are fairly common software tools and many of them 
          may already be on your computer. Do a Search or Find files on your machine 
          to see which ones you need. </Blockquote>
