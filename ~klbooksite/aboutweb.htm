<h3>About this Web site</h3>

This Web site contains a page for each
section of the book <b>Principles of Calculus Modeling, an Interactive Approach</b>. A section page includes a summary of the section, an on-screen applet demonstrating the key point of the section, and what you should know after studying the material of the section.  It also includes links to
<ul>
<li>additional in-depth applets,
<li>worked examples,
<li>videos of problems being worked out by students and teachers,
<li>a quiz (with answers) that you can take to test your knowledge,
<li>a link to a PDF document with of all the exercises of the section,
<li>a link to these same exercises in interactive form with answer feedback, and
<li>hypertext links to other supplementary materials on the Web that you might find useful, such as sample exams.
</ul>

We envision students reading a section of the book, and then going to klbooksite for an overview of the
section and links to the applets and homework.
<p>
Animations will require that computer users have installed Macromedia Flash player. Applets will require
both PC and Macintosh users to view them with Microsoft Internet Explorer browser (where Macintosh users also must

install the accompanying MRJ package from Apple). Exercise printouts require Adobe Acrobat Reader to
view them. And video clips need something like RealPlayer. All of these software tools are free and readily
available on the Web.
