<font size=+2>R</font>apid progress in computer power and numerical algorithms in
recent decades has revolutionized science and technology.
The Laplace equation (describing steady-state diffusion, heat flow,
electrostatics) and Helmholtz equation (linear waves, acoustics,
electromagnetics, optics, quantum) are linear PDE boundary value 
problems,
ubiquitous in modeling the real world. They may be solved numerically by
recasting the problem onto the boundary; this is more efficient at short
wavelengths (and easier to code) than standard discretization methods. 
We will lay a foundation in numerical analysis, as well as some in PDEs,
and build codes, study their errors, and later
explore phenomena in wave scattering and so-called <i>fast algorithms</i>.
You will learn some of the deep mathematics required to understand
the success and efficiency of modern algorithms.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Admin</b>:</font> Office hours (Kemeny 206): Tu 2-3 pm, Th 2:30-3:30pm, F 2-3pm, or by arrangement.
X-hour is 3pm Wed; some will be used for coding workshops with your laptops
(but you won't need laptops in regular lectures).
The grading scheme will be 65% HW and 35% project.

<p><font size=+1><b>Homework</b>:</font>
You will do around 7 weekly homeworks, due on Sunday night (I start grading Monday 9am), handed out or emailed the Thursday/Friday over a week before. HW will be a mixture of
theory, and coding numerical experiments and understanding the results.
Writing intelligible and documented code is a useful skill that we will
be emphasizing.
I encourage you to discuss with each other (but see <a href="index.html#honor"Honor code</a> below).
In the interests of you learning some tools for scientific collaboration, I want you to post your HW online on your website (see <a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/res.html">Resources</a>). I am giving you time in the first few days to do this.
You can write by hand your HW, and scan it; however a much better way, which
you will rapidly get used to, is to typeset it in LaTeX (see <a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/res.html">Resources</a>). This is an invaluable skill, so please dive in.

<p><font size=+1><b>Project</b>:</font>
In the last part of the course you will also do a project building upon the
course material; see <i>topic ideas <a
href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/projects.txt">list</a></i>, and also
<a href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m116f08#proj">previous student projects</a>.
Projects may be analysis-based (presenting theorems), or developing and demonstrating numerical code, or a mixture of both.
Come and talk if you have your own ideas.
Since it is a graduate level course, projects will be individual.
You will present your projects with a short in-class talk
on Tuesday March 6 and Wed March 7.
Final project writeups (in LaTeX, with which you will be very familiar by then) due 5pm Fri March 9.

<a name="honor"></a>
<p><font size=+1><b>Honor Principle</b>:</font> For homework and projects, 
you are encouraged to discuss with others, but must acknowledge your
collaborators (or other sources such as textbooks, papers, or the web), and
must write up your work in your own words, and with your own
understanding.  If you collaborate on pieces of your code, this must
be stated.  Any copying (electronic or otherwise) of another person's
solutions, in whole or in part, is a violation of the Honor Code.

<p><font size=+1><b>Books</b>:</font>
The content I wish to teach is distributed across several books.
Thus there is no single required book, but I will suggest readings from the following which will be on 4-hr reserve at Baker Library.
We may scan some small portions.
Any serious student of numerical computing should consider buying the first two.
<ul>
<li>L. N. Trefethen and D. Bau, Numerical Linear Algebra (SIAM, 1997)
$57.50 [NLA].
<br>
This popular book explains in beautiful style the algorithms for linear systems, eigenvalues, etc, used every day by thousands of scientists worldwide.
<li> R. Kress, Numerical Analysis, Graduate Texts in Mathematics 181 (Springer, 1998) $75. [NA]
<br>
Clear, concise, analysis-leaning overview of the whole subject. Excellent
for integral equations, poorer for linear systems.
<li> R. Kress, Linear Integral Equations, 2nd Edition (Applied Mathematical Sciences vol. 82, Springer-Verlag, 1999). [LIE]
<br>A standard graduate-level text including background on functional analysis.
<li>D. Colton. Partial Differential Equations: An Introduction (Dover 2004 edition). [C]
<br>Advanced undergrad or first-year grad level PDE book with some analysis done with elementary tools. Unusually good for Helmholtz equation and potential theory.
<li>L. N. Trefethen, Spectral Methods in MATLAB (SIAM, 2000). [SM]
</ul>
Other key books are:
<ul>
<li>D. Colton and R. Kress, Inverse Acoustic and Electromagnetic Scattering Theory, 2nd Ed. (Springer, 1998).
<li>L. N. Trefethen, <a href="http://www2.maths.ox.ac.uk/chebfun/ATAP/ATAPJune11.pdf">Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice</a> (draft, 2011) [ATAP]
<br>
Beautiful key ideas of differentiation, interpolation, quadrature on grids, with exponential convergence. Elegant 1-page Matlab codes.
</ul>
Also see <a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/res.html">papers and other resources</a>

<p><font size=+1><b>Background</b>:</font> While formally you could
do well with only Math 22/24 and 23 and an introductory programming course (such as CS 1 or the old CS5), you will benefit from having taken at
least one of the following: Math 46, Math 35/63, Math 26/Engs 91.
You may have to do some background reading - please let me know what areas you
are stuck on.

<p><font size=+1><b>Computing languages</b>:</font>
I prefer, and suggest, that you use MATLAB (see
<a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/res.html">Resources</a> for tutorials) or its free variant
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/"><code>octave</code></a>.
It is a wonderful and efficient environment, created by numerical
analysts (founded: Cleve Moler) for exactly our kind of work.
However, if you are really committed to another language, I won't
penalize you for it, as long as your code is clear, well commented, and works!

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Disabilities</b>:</font> 
I encourage any students with disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities such as chronic diseases and learning disabilities, to discuss appropriate accommodations with me, which might help you with this class, either after class or during office hours. Please do this by the first 2 weeks of class. Dartmouth College has an active program to help students with disabilities, and I am happy to do whatever I can to help out, as appropriate.
See <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/home/about/accessibility.html">Accessibility</a> for Dartmouth's information on this.
