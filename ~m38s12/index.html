<b>Office hours:</b> 314 Kemeny, M 1:35-2, W 1:35-3, Th 2:30-3:30.<br>

<b>Course Description</b><br>
The theory of graphs has roots in both practical and recreational mathematics. Today there are major applications of graph theory in management science (operations research) and computer science. This course is a survey of the theory and applications of graphs. Topics will be chosen from among connectivity, trees, and Hamiltonian and Eulerian paths and cycles; isomorphism and reconstructability; planarity, duality, and genus; independence and coloring problems, including interval graphs, interval orderings and perfect graphs, color-critical graphs and the four-color theorem; matchings; network flows, including applications to matchings, higher connectivity, and transportation problems; matroids and their relationship with optimization.

Prerequisite: Mathematics 22 (or Computer Science 25 or 31 and permission of the instructor). Dist: QDS.

<b>Homework</b><br>
Weekly homework assignments can be found here: <a href="day-to-day.html">Homework and schedule</a>

<p>

<b>Grades</b><br>
In addition to homework, there will be one midterm and one final exam. We will also have occasional quizzes.
<p>



10% - quizzes<br>
20% - homework<br>
30% - midterm<br>
40% - final<br><p>

<b>Honor principle</b><br>
On the exams and quizzes, you will work individually, guided by the Dartmouth Academic Honor Principle. On the daily homework exercises, you are encouraged to work collaboratively, but your write-ups should be your own. Collaboration does not include copying someone else's work--a clear violation of the Honor Principle. Use all the resources available to you, including the insights of your classmates and Prof. Daugherty. When it comes to writing up the homework, you should do this by yourself without outside assistance. 


<p>
<b>Special needs</b><br> 
I encourage students with disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases and learning disabilities, to discuss with us any appropriate accommodations that might be helpful. Let me know asap, certainly in first 2 weeks. Also stop by the Academic Skills Center in 301 Collis to register for support services, or call ext. 6-2014.


<p>

<b>Religious observance</b><br>
 Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.

<p>

<B>Serious Illness</B><br>
If you contract a flu or other serious illness, please contact me by email.  I will be happy to make arrangements for you to make up late work, or exams if you provide us with a note from Dick's house.  Please do not come to class if you have an influenza-like illness. For more information on what to do if you believe you have the flu, see the <A HREF="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~prepare/common_hazards/influenza_and_illness.html">Dartmouth web page </A>devoted to this topic.
