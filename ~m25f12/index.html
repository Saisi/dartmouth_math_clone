<p><font size="+1"><b>General Comments on the Course: </b></font>

</p>




<li>This course is an introduction to number theory. The properties of numbers, that is, whole integers, will be studied in detail.The mathematical requirements for beginning the study of number theory are minimal. We will consider a variety of elementary but important results and conjectures, and illustrate a few of the applications of basic number theory.
The ORC prerequisite for this class is Math 8 (Calculus II), but in reality virtually no calculus is needed. Perhaps the most important determinant for learning this material is willingness to immerse oneself in these ideas and think diligently about them.

<ul>
  <li> On Exams: No help given or received.  <br></li>
</ul>

<ul>  
<li>On Homework: Students are encouraged to work together with one or two classmates and/or to seek help from the instructor. Office hours are on Tuesday, the day before homework is due, and students are strongly encouraged to come by for help.   Students should state on their homework paper the names of those with whom they have collaborated. What is important in doing homework is the eventual comprehension of the solution of the problem. 
When a student writes up a homework problem it is to be his or her own understanding of how to solve the problem. The solutions that a student submits must be written by him or her alone. Any copying of another person's solutions will be regarded as a violation of the Honor Code.</i> <br></li>
