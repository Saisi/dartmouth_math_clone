<h2 style="width: 1000px;">Welcome to Math 46<br />
</h2>
This is <strong>Math 46</strong>: Introduction to applied
mathematics.&nbsp; <br />
<a style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);" href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m46s13/study_tips.pdf">Here</a> are
some helpful tips for success.<br />

<h3>Instructor and General Information</h3>

<p>Note that you do not need an appointment to attend
regularly-scheduled
office hours. If you have a conflict you may make an appointment to
meet outside those times.</p>
<b>Lectures</b>: MWF 1:35-2:50 <span style="font-weight: bold;">X-hr</span>:
Th 1-1:50<br />
<br />
I strongly recommend you read the material in the
book <i>in advance</i> of
the lecture. X-hour will be used intermittently for: Matlab sessions,
review, problem-solving sessions, catch-up lectures, etc.
Do not schedule anything regular in this X-hr; I expect to use about
half of them.<br />
<br />
<b>Textbook:</b>&nbsp; <i>Applied Mathematics</i>, Third Edition by J.
David Logan (Published by Wiley Interscience, New York, 2006). This
otherwise excellent book has a moderate list of <a style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);" href="../~m46s11/errata_logan.html">errata</a>
which I suggest you copy in to save later confusion. Available at <a style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);" href="../~m46s11/wheelock.html">Wheelock
Books</a>, etc.<br />
<br />
<p><b>Homework</b>: Weekly homeworks are due Wednesday at start of lecture.
I strongly suggest you <i>collaborate</i>, and
try at least some of the
relevant homework problems <i>before the next lecture</i>
(leaving it all for Tuesday night
risks you getting left behind in this fast-paced course.)
Please make your working/reasoning as clear as you can, write clearly,
don't be scared of using lots of space on the page, and staple your
work.
<font color="red">Late homework will not be accepted</font>
(unless by prior arrangement for a valid, and <i>exceptional</i>,
reason).
Your lowest HW score will be dropped, ie you get a `free' HW.
</p>
<p><b>Private tutoring</b>: Tutor Clearinghouse <i>may</i> have
private
one-on-one tutors available for Math 46 (although this is rare in
advanced courses, so come and talk to me if you feel lost and no tutors
are available).
If a student receives financial aid, the
College will pay for three hours of tutoring per week. If you would
like to have a tutor, please go to 301 Collis and apply as early as
possible.
</p>
<p><b>Students with disabilities</b> who will be taking this course and
may need
disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to make an
appointment to see
their instructor as soon as possible. Also, they should stop by the
Academic Skills
Center in Collis Center to register for support services.</p>

<h3>The Honor Principle</h3>
<p><b>On Exams</b>: No assistance may be given or received except that
you may ask the instructor for clarification of a problem. In
particular, no calculators or computing devices may be used.</p>
<p><b>On Homework</b>: You are permitted and encouraged to collaborate
with other students on the
homework. However, after discussing the problems, you should each write
up the final
solutions in your own words and acknowledge your collaborators. You may
use calculators and approved
software. Additionally, you may consult your class notes
and text. It is a violation of the honor code for someone to provide
the answers for you.</p>
