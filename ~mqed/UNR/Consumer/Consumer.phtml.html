Each module typically contains one or two examples related to "real world" quantitative literacy   issues and includes exercises for students. There is also a section "for the instructor" that contains discussions of some    of the topics, solutions to the exercises, and resources for further explorations.</FONT>		</td>		</tr>		</table><table border="0"><tr><td width="550" background="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~mqed/NLA/image/plant650.gif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><P ALIGN="right">&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+3">Consumer Numeracy</FONT><BR><BR>Jerry Johnson<BR>University of Nevada, Reno</P><P ALIGN="left">Quantitative literacy is very important when it comes to being an informedconsumer. Quantitatively literate consumers understand how to select the best values andthey are less likely to be cheated.</P><P ALIGN="left">In deciding the best buy on a pizza one needs to be aware that the area of a circle is <FONT FACE="symbol">p</FONT> r<SUP>2</SUP>,which is the same thing as <FONT FACE="symbol">p</FONT> / 4 =  d <SUP>2</SUP> where d is the diameter. This means that the area isproportional to the square of the radius (or the square of the diameter). Thus, doubling thediameter quadruples the area. Pizza sizes are usually given in terms of their diameters. Bythe way, <FONT FACE="symbol">p</FONT> is about 3.14.</P><P ALIGN="left">In considering the price of carpet, one might need to know how to convert betweensquare feet and square yards. (One square yard is nine square feet.) Other conversions areuseful as well, such as between liters and ounces (one liter is about 33.82 ounces).</P><P ALIGN="left">The mathematics is arithmetic, calculating the area of a rectangle and a circle and, conversion of units ofmeasurement.</P>
