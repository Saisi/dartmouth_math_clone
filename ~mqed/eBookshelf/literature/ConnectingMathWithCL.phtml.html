The subject of the module is Maurice Sendak's book <cite>Where the Wild Things Are</cite> which has been a children's favorite for almost fifty years.  Close observation and analysis of some of this book's key features will give students an opportunity to develop skills which will help them choose books that will engage children, as well as reinforce important math skills.  For future educators and parents, this assignment may also help them use children's literature as a fun way to explore math concepts.  This assignment has three parts; each asks students to compile data as well as discuss how that data leads to better understanding the illustrators' work.</P><P>Connecting Math with Children's Literature: <br />Where the Wild Things Are</P>
