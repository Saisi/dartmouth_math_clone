Seeking to introduce students to the relationship betweenmathematics and other disciplines, this program begins by looking at thecomputer enhancement of satellite data. After examining the integralcalculus behind interpreting geologic information through computerenhanced images, we also look at the image making process itself throughthe eyes of a textile artist. The program is intended for both geologyand calculus students to provide more scope to the calculus throughexposure to applications. It is not intended specifically to fit into anintroductory calculus curriculum.  This video features mathematicianElinor Velasquez, geologist Dick Birnie, and Shibori artist Joan Morris.</P><P ALIGN="left">Eyes On The Earth II : <BR>Variance & Covariance (TRT 27:00):  An analysisof the colors in a satellite photo leads to a search for redundantinformation.  The geologist's software can display scatterplots thatshow the correlation between different parts of the visible andinvisible light spectrum.  As in Eyes on the Earth I, the material ispresented as a conversation among a mathematician, geologist and artist.This video features mathematician Elinor Velasquez, geologist DickBirnie, and watercolor artist Clifford West.</P><P ALIGN="left">Eyes On The Earth III: <BR>Eigenvector Analysis (33:45):  The specialmathematical technique of principle component analysis allows thegeologist to extract layers of uncorrelated information from a compleximage.  This method allows the geologist to pick out landscape featuresnot immediately apparent from a true color image.  The technique can beused on any image, and this episode offers a unique opportunity to seeit applied to a watercolor painting and to watch the artist's reaction.This video features mathematician Elinor Velasquez, geologist DickBirnie, and watercolor artist Clifford West.</P><P ALIGN="left">Eyes on the Earth II and III would fit well in an advanced statisticscourse or an applied linear algebra course.  All three videos would besuitable for a signal processing course, a remote sensing course, or asatellite imaging course.</P><P ALIGN="left">These films may be obtained by contacting Edwin Gailits atgailits@sympatico.ca.</P><P ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~mqed/eBookshelf/image/eyes.jpg" ALT=""></P></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
