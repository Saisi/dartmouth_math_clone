  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font size="+1">
  A Humorous Calculus Review</font> </font></p>
    
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The videos in the That's Calculus! 
    series are not ordinary math videos. They have humor, character development, 
    even an occasional plot. They also have an occasional blackboard, but even 
    a blackboard becomes something out of the ordinary when performance artist 
    Josh Kornbluth stands in front of it. </font></p>
    
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to one definition, learning 
    a concept consists of making mental connections to other concepts and ideas. 
    The more connections, the more complete the learning. The creators of the 
    That's Calculus! videos, Dartmouth professors Dorothy Wallace and Marcia Groszek, 
    suggest connections through visual imagery, metaphor and humor, to help students 
    learn mathematical concepts and remember them. </font></p>
    
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The videos in this series are not 
    intended to replace classroom lessons or textbooks, nor to be a student's 
    first introduction to the concepts they explore. They are designed to supplement 
    high school or college classes, home schooling, or independent study. Whether 
    used concurrently with the study of a given topic, as a review and synopisis 
    at the end of a unit of study, or later as a reminder, the That's Calculus! 
    videos are made to expand students' understanding and appreciation of mathematics. 
    </font></p>
    
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These videos were produced under 
    the auspices of the Mathematics Across the Curriculum project at Dartmouth 
    College, funded by the National Science Foundation.</font></p>
    
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font size="+2">To 
    The Limit</font> </font></p>
    
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">(Running time 20 
    minutes)</font></p>
    
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In this video, the first in the 
    series, Josh Kombluth, the nationally acclaimed performance artist and star 
    of the series, examines the limits of various functions f(x) as x approaches 
    a point where the function is undefined. In addition, he takes a culinary 
    look at functions. As you will see, he is unlike most instructors students 
    are likely to encounter. </font></p>
    
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mathematical Content: This video 
    concerns the intuitive notion of limit. Josh presents a treatment of the limit 
    of a function f(x) as x approaches a point where f(x) is undefined. He looks 
    at this limit in spveral ways, with a visual examination of thp graph of the 
    funntion, a computational analysis of the formula 
    for f(x) (in this case, a quotient of polynomials), and a table of values. 
    He also makes a connection to the puzzling claim that .99999 ... =1. </font></p>
    
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2">
  The Formal Limit</font></p>
    
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
  (Part 1, running time 25 minutes; Part 2, running time 27 minutes) </font></p>
    
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this program Josh looks at epsilon-delta 
    from a number of perspectives, including a magical blackboard discussion of 
    the topic, and some imagined and some real-world demonstrations. It follows 
    the action of an epsilon-delta game, discusses the squeeze theorem, and looks 
    at a number of unlikely places you might encounter epsilon-delta in your social 
    life. </font></p>
    
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mathematical Content: Josh presents 
    the formal, epsilon-delta definition of limit on the blackboard and uses it 
    to give a formal proof of the "squeeze theorem." The quantifier structure 
    of the definition ("for all epsilon ... there exits delta ... for all x") 
    is also explicated by means of a board game (in which players alternate playing 
    epsilon, delta and x) and through a character who utters English sentences 
    having the same for all ... there exists ... for all ... quantifier structure.</font></p>

  Josh and the Mathemagician</font> </font></p>
    
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">
  (Part 1, running time 43 minutes; Part 2, running time 38 minutes)</font></p>
    
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In Part 1, Josh meets a mysterious 
    woman dressed as a bag lady who can find where any function has its largest 
    and smallest values. He undertakes a quest to find the secret to her arcane 
    knowledge of max an min. In Part 2, Josh advances his status in the mysterious 
    cult by learning to compute the derivatives of various and complicated functions. 
    His brave efforts earn his induction into the cult. </font></p>
    
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mathematical Content: Part 1 covers 
    the definition of the derivative. Josh begins with the formula for the slope 
    of a line, derives the (limit) definition of the derivative, and uses this 
    definition to find the derivatives of the functions x squared, and then x 
    to any (positive integer) power. Part 2 covers some rules for computing derivatives, 
    including a proof of the product rule, and examples for use of the sum, product 
    and chain rules. </font></p>
    
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2">
  In Search of the Derivative</font></p>
    
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">
  (Part 1, running time 23 minutes; Part 2, running time 27 minutes) </font></p>
    
  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this applications-oriented 
    show, Josh plays the student. Part I begins with Josh's visit to a mathematician, 
    followed by an explosive stop in a chemist's lab. In Part 2 he continues his 
    search for real-world applications, making field visits with a geologist who 
    examines radioactive decay and an economist who looks at the problems associated 
    with selecting insurance for a bike messenger. </font></p>
    
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mathematical Content: In this video, 
    various scientists show Josh how the derivative is used in their respective 
    fields. In Part 1, a mathematician reviews the definition of the derivative 
    and its use in analyzing shapes of curves, and a chemist explains that reaction 
    rates of chemical reactions are derivatives. In Part 2, a geologist talks 
    about exponential decay, and an economist explains marginal cost. </font></p>
