<h2>Jetta or Jaguar? Buying your ideal car</h2>

<p>
According to <a href="http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1997/06/art4full.pdf">this 
report<img src="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/images/pdf.png" border="0" /></a> 
describing two separate 
studies (published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics), the majority of workers commute to 
work by automobile, and the costs associated with automobiles are a major portion of the 
household budget.  Households making under $70,000 per year spent an average of almost $8000 
per year on car expenses in 2008. (<a href="http://www.bls.gov/cex/tables.htm">Bureau of 
Labor Statistics and Census Bureau</a>).
<p>
We are a car-oriented country.  It is no wonder that graduates starting a new job feel they need 
to buy a car.  But the statistics suggest that decisions about what car to buy and how to go 
about purchasing it are not always informed by pure rationality.  In this module we invite 
students to consider their motivations for choosing a certain kind of car, go through the 
process of budgeting for all car expenses, and compare the consequences of purchasing 
different choices of vehicle and financing it in various ways.</p>

<p>We suggest that instructors open the <a href="carpurchasenotes.php.html" target="blank">instructor notes</a> for this module, save them as a PDF file, and print them for reference.</p>

<p>This module also includes assessment tools (pre and post test) and a case study for deeper investigation of this topic. These resources are available by contacting <a href="mailto:audrey.brown@dartmouth.edu}">Audrey Brown
</a>.</p>
