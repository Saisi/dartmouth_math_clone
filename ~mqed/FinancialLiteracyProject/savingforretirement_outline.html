<h2>Saving for Retirement- Outline</h2>

<p>
Slides are tagged by opening line.

<ol>
   <li>&rdquo;Your parents&rdquo; opens the discussion with an image.</li>
   <li> &ldquo;are in a retirement crisis&rdquo; shows a humorous video of the results of bad planning. </li>
   <li> &ldquo;So you sit down&rdquo; invites students to do the math. </li>
   <li> &ldquo;They think they could&rdquo; makes some assumptions about living standards after retirement and draws on a result from the &ldquo;Your Parents Will Move In With You&rdquo; module.   </li>
   <li> &ldquo;Right now&rdquo; describes the current amount invested in the couple's retirement 401k funds.   </li>
   <li> &ldquo;They want you&rdquo; sets up the math problem of figuring out how much to put away each year in order to have a certain amount after 25 years.   </li>
   <li> &ldquo;As always&rdquo; asks the basic questions of current savings and expected returns.  </li>
   <li>&ldquo;Your dad&rdquo;  include a video that points out that parents continue to have aspirations after retirement.  They are not just vegetables on life support.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;So right now&rdquo; sets up the math problem and notation for an investment at constant rate of growth with some annual deposit.</li>
   <li> &ldquo;What about year 2?&rdquo; asks students to iterate the first few years of this process.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;How about S25?&rdquo;   shows the result of 25 iterations, which can be inferred.</li>
   <li> &ldquo;Let's remember a fact from basic algebra&rdquo; reminds students how to sum the consecutive powers of x.</li>
   <li> &ldquo;So in the formula&rdquo; incorporates the algebra fact into the formula for the amount invested after 25 years of good behavior.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;Suppose you and your parents&rdquo; asks students to plug some of the relevant numbers into the formula just derived.   </li>
   <li>&ldquo;Suppose we estimate&rdquo; suggest an average annual rate of return, which may vary.  </li>
   <li>&ldquo;Then&rdquo;  incorporates these estimates to find the relation between the current amount in savings and the needed annual deposit. That relation is a line.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;What line?&rdquo; compares this formula to the one usually found in math textbooks.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;There is a linear relationship&rdquo; hammers the point home.  It then asks how much must be invested each year if there are no savings at present.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;$13,110&rdquo; gives the answer and asks for other scenarios.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;What happens if&rdquo; changes the interest rate.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;From the calculation&rdquo; points out the large difference when interest goes down and brings up the added contribution of social security.  </li>
   <li>&ldquo;Using the information&rdquo; asks students to estimate this couple's social security benefit using an online calculator.  </li>
   <li>&ldquo;Good news!&rdquo; Thanks to social security the couple will need less money, and students are invited to figure out the new contribution needed.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;Some people argue&rdquo;  has a video where &ldquo;experts&rdquo; disagree as to how much a couple will need upon retiremen.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;Suppose your parents&rdquo; reduces the amount needed to 80%  of final salary and asks students to recalculate.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;Maybe you don't believe&rdquo; looks at the situation of having 50 years of investment.  </li>
   <li>&ldquo;Remember the formula&rdquo; asks students to revise the formula to reflect 50 years of steady investment.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;S50= (1.08)50S0 + A((1.08)50 &ndash; 1 ) /.08&rdquo; gives the answer and asks the students to figure out how much must be invested each year to get to the same amount.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;About $2614 per year!&rdquo; gives the answer and asks a personal question.</li>
   <li> &ldquo;We have done some nice algebra&rdquo;  points out some of the assumptions made about interest rates in this calculation.</li>
   <li> &ldquo;The calculation you just did&rdquo; asks students to use the formula to do both conservative and optimistic estimates, and opens a discussion about reality.  The video here is a parody of the one in slide 8.</li>
