   <li>&ldquo;What is the stock market&rdquo; describes publicly traded stocks.</li>

   <li> &ldquo;It is very easy&rdquo; describes how to buy stock.  </li>

   <li>&ldquo;See if you can find&rdquo; asks students to find financial quantities on a stock fact sheet.</li>

   <li>&ldquo;In the last example&rdquo; compares the financial quantities on the stock sheet to the example in slide 4.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;Why buying stocks&rdquo; explains why stocks are a riskier investment than savings or bonds.</li>

   <li>&ldquo;Here is the price&rdquo; lets students compare this to variation over one month. </li>

   <li>&ldquo;Here is AT&amp;T over six months&rdquo; shows six months, asking students to predict the near future.</li>

   <li> &ldquo;Here is AT&amp;T over one year&rdquo; shows one year.</li>

   <li>&ldquo;Here is AT&amp;T over five years&rdquo; shows five years, again asking for a prediction.</li>
