 <h2>You've Got To Hand It To Them<br />
Understanding Taxes</h2>
<p>
According to the <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/index.cfm">Tax Policy Center</a>.
Individual income and payroll taxes make up 82% of all federal revenues and account 
for 27.3% of the gross domestic product. In addition to these taxes are state taxes, 
sales tax, luxury taxes and more. How taxes are distributed among income groups, how 
they are collected, and how the revenue is spent are basic issues of governance relevant 
to all citizens.</p> 

<p>How will taxes affect your budget and take home pay? What kinds of taxes will you 
have to pay, and in what forms?  How do taxes vary in different parts of the country? 
How do local, state, and federal governments spend the money?  What happens if you 
don't pay your taxes or don't file a tax return? Through this module, students will 
gain a better understanding of both their own budgets and the budget of their country.</p>

<p>We suggest that instructors open the <a href="taxInstructorNotes.php.html">instructor notes</a> for this module, 
save them as a PDF file, and print them for reference. This module also includes 
assessment tools (pre and post test) and a case study for deeper investigation of this 
topic. These resources are available by contacting <a href="mailto:audrey.brown@dartmouth.edu">Audrey Brown</a>.</p>
