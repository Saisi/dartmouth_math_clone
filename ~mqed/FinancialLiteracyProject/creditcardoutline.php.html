<h2><a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~mqed/FinancialLiteracyProject/FLCreditCardOffers">Understanding Credit Card Offers</a> - Outline</h2>

<p>
Slides are tagged by opening line.
<ol>
<li>"Credit cards are a great convenience" Short videos lead to a discussion of good credit practice, in preparation for a more extensive exploration. (first few slides)
<li>"Suppose you want to buy a computer" describes an offer from a credit card company.
<li>"Your initial balance on the credit card" sets up three scenarios for paying for an item on this card.
<li>"For each of the three scenarios" invites students to make some initial calculations by hand to see what happens in each case.
<li>"Questions for thought and discussion" asks for a preliminary judgement on these three scenarios before moving on to deeper analysis.
<li>"Of course, if you have enough money" asks students to move to a spreadsheet (provided) or online calculator (links provided) to find out what happens over the lifetime of the loan.
<li>"Questions for discussion" asks students to compare the three scenarios to each other, and to the original offer made by the company.
<li>"The true cost of a loan" makes explicit ties with the math topics of linear and exponential growth.
<li>"What people usually do" invites students to use the spreadsheet or online calculators to explore more complex human behavior and the financial results.
<li>"One factor that definitely affects" is a comparison of interest rates.
<li>"Some people feel" concludes the module with a video that balances the first two shown, and opens a discussion of the larger aspects of credit card use.
