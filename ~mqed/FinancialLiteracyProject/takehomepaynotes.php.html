You can use this video to open a discussion in class.  Here are some questions that could be useful.
<ul>
<li>Who remembers their first paycheck? Were you surprised by the amount?

<li>Why is the amount you take home less than the amount the employer has to pay?

<li>What is a "deduction"? Money is removed from a paycheck for what sorts of reasons?
</ul>
It is not important at this point that students identify all possible deductions, but just to remind them of some basic kinds of deductions, such as taxes or health insurance.

 
<h2><a name="thpni2">THPNI2</a></h2>
<p>Download Thomas the Teacher's Paycheck <a href="TomTeacherPaystub.pdf" target="_blank">here 
<img src="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/images/pdf.png" /?></a></p>
Here is a helpful <a href="takehomepayworksheet.pdf">worksheet</a> students can use to track 
their calculation in this module.

Students should be able to figure out that there are 26 pay periods in a year, and so Thomas 
would have $27,640.60 if he got $1,063.10 each pay period.

Some things to point out:
<ul>
<li>We will see that he actually makes a little less than this because some of his deductions 
are not taken in August.

<li>In some months Thomas gets 3 paychecks.  How often could that happen?  Is there a month 
in which Thomas could not possibly get 3 paychecks? Why? (February)

<li>If Thomas is making approximately $41,000 and takes home approximately $27,640.60, what 
percent of his pay does he get to keep? What percent is deducted?
</ul>


<h3>For Future Teachers</h3>

<p>Many high school or middle school students either have, or will be interested in having an after school job.  All of the issues of take home pay in this module are applicable and most of them can be simplified for use in the classroom.  </p>

<p>Here is an actual <a href="studentpaystub.pdf">student paystub</a> with the name of the employer and student removed that can be used as the basis for an activity. Once your students have finished the module, have them design a Paystub lesson for use with high school or middle school students. </p>

 
<h2><a name="thpni3">THPNI3</a></h2>

It might be good to point out that all of these are listed in the right hand YTD (year to date) column.  This column provides a running tally of all the money put into each category since the first of the calendar year.  
<ul>
<li>So, for example, if you divide the YTD HARVARD IND of 492.79 by the amount of HARVARD IND per pay period of 32.91, you should get the number of pay periods, approximately, since the start of the year.

<li>Of course this calculation works for all the other items as well, so different groups of students could do different calculations and they should all get the same near-integer answer.  
</ul>
This is just long division, but it reinforces the meaning of what is in these columns.

<h3>For Future Teachers</h3>

Future teachers should note that long division is far more meaningful when units are attached to the numbers.  Its use becomes more apparent when something important is being divided.  What kinds of problems would make  long division meaningful to K-12 students?
 
<h2><a name="thpni4">THPNI4</a></h2>

Here are some questions for discussion of the various tax deductions.
<ul>
<li>What percentage of Thomas's salary is federal income tax? 

<li>How much of the federal budget comes from income taxes? Students can make a guess, but 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>,  
gives a pie chart for 2009.

<li>What percentage of Thomas's salary is FICA MEDIC, Social Security and Medicare?  The 
deduction rate for social security is 6.2% according to 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Insurance_Contributions_Act_tax#cite_note-Section3101-5" 
target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> and for Medicare, 1.45%.  Is Thomas paying this much? (No!)  Why not?

<li>It turns out that the State of Massachusetts runs its own social security program for 
state employees, so Thomas's contribution to TCH 11% covers this.  See the 
<a href="http://www.mass.gov/mtrs/2members/20active/20membership.htm" target="_blank">
MTRS website</a>, and look for the question about "why don't I pay into social security?".  
So Thomas is only paying the Medicare deduction.
</ul>
 
<h2><a name="thpni5">THPNI5</a></h2>

How does society take care of its elderly?  Here is an approach you can use with your class.
<ul>
<li>How do elderly people support themselves when they can no longer work? (You are looking for 
a list of things that you can put on the board, including social security, pensions, 401k, 
IRA, whatever the students know about.)

<li>What does it mean to say that a pension depends on salary, and years of work?  What exactly 
is Massachusetts guaranteeing here? (An agreed upon monthly payment regardless of market 
fluctuations, until you die.)

<li>How does this differ from, say, an IRA?  (An IRA is an investment in the market and will 
grow or shrink depending on market conditions. You can even spend it out completely before you die.)  

<li>Thomas is not paying into social security.  If he remains in the state school system 
until retirement, he will not receive much from social security, only his pension.  Given that 
the state is collecting his social security benefits for him, what is his employer 
actually contributing to his retirement beyond these? (If social security is 6.2% and TCH 
is collecting 11%, the effective retirement contribution from Thomas is only 4.8%).
</ul>
<h2><a name="thpni6">THPNI6</a></h2>

Health insurance is another topic that can generate a good quantitative discussion.  Thomas 
is paying $32 per month for health insurance.  Is that a lot?
<ul>
<li>What if you want to buy your own health insurance?  Students can go to 
<a href="http://www.ehealthinsurance.com/individual-health-insurance" target="_blank">
ehealthinsurance</a> and get a collection of quotes.  Most of these will be a lot higher than 
what Thomas is paying.
</ul>
 
<h2><a name="thpni7">THPNI7</a></h2>

This is the opening to a budget discussion.  By now the students should see that you couldn't 
just divide $41,000 by 12 and get an accurate idea of what you can spend.  
<ul>
<li>But how should you think about the 26 pay periods in monthly terms?  Most bills are monthly.

<li>And how should you think about deductions that occur in some months but not others?
</ul>
 
<h2><a name="thpni8">THPNI8</a></h2>

Thomas's YTD (year to date) earnings divided by pay period earnings confirm 16 pay periods 
so far.  Since there are 26 pay periods in a year, Thomas earns 26 times $1,573.58 
annually, $40,913.08.  Almost, but not quite, $41,000.  
 
<h2><a name="thpni9">THPNI9</a></h2>

Thomas's retirement contribution is mandatory, but some kinds of retirement instruments 
(like IRA's, which students may have mentioned earlier in the discussion) are voluntary.  
Thomas is not currently making voluntary contributions to his retirement, but he could.

<p>The reason to discuss these categories now is that some are tax-exempt.  That is, the 
employee is not taxed on certain kinds of retirement related deductions.</p>

<p>This is why the TAXABLE GROSS is different from the Gross Pay.</p>

 
<h2><a name="thpni10">THPNI10</a></h2>

For Thomas the only tax-exempt (or pre-tax) categories are TCH 11% and HARVARD IND.  
Subtracting these amounts from the gross pay will give the taxable gross.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.moneychimp.com/features/tax_brackets.htm" target="_blank">
Moneychimp</a> gives income tax 
brackets.  Thomas is in the 25% income tax bracket according to this site. Did he pay the 
full 25%? No.  But note that this percent is calculated on the taxable gross, not the total 
pay.  It is still not quite 25%. Why might he have avoided this? 

<li>The 25% listed is a marginal tax rate.  That is, it is only charged on the last dollars 
earned. He'd be in the 25% marginal tax bracket, if his taxable income were greater than 
$33,950. For this one paycheck, the taxable gross is $1,367.58, so we'd multiply that by 26 
to get a good guess at the taxable income for the year as $35.557.08.
</ul>
For a single person in that 25% marginal tax bracket in 2009, here's how the tax schedule worked:<br />
The first $8,350 in taxable income was taxed at 10%.<br />
Taxable income between $8,350 and $33,950 was taxed at 15%,
and the highest layer of income (above $32,950) was taxed at 25%.

Thomas had only about $1600 that was taxed at 25%.  Most of the earnings were taxed at 15%; 
some at 10%.
<ul>
<li>What about state tax rates?  Thomas is in Massachusetts.  
<a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/taxdata/show/228.html" target="_blank">The Tax Foundation</a> 
gives rates for all of the states.  How does Massachusetts compare with other states?  Is 
Thomas paying the full rate?
</ul>
 
<h2><a name="thpni11">THPNI11</a></h2>

Thomas takes home 67.56% of his pay in months where there are no union dues.  This is 
just $2,126.20 divided by $3,147.16. 

One third of his paycheck is going to taxes, social security, health care plan, life 
insurance, and his retirement pension.

 
<h2><a name="thpni12">THPNI12</a></h2>

An interesting exercise for the class would be to have each person bring in a paystub--theirs 
or a parent's or friend's, with identifying data removed.  
<ul>
<li>Each person could construct a pie chart based on their paystub and these could be printed 
and compared.

<li>This data is also an excuse for collecting statistics and creating a pie chart based on 
the average percentages in each category.  Better statistics would include a bar chart, so 
the spread in percentages would also be visible.
</ul>

<h3>For the future teacher</h3>

Percents are a part of the middle school curriculum and creating charts to display data is 
good way to connect this module to classroom practice.
For example, elementary students could brainstorm as a class what expenses a household might 
have and discuss how to construct a pie chart. For a homework assignment, they could talk 
with their parents and try to figure what percentage of the household budget goes to food, 
rent or mortgage and the other items they have thought of on the classroom list. This data 
would then be a basis for creating a household budget pie chart in class as individuals or 
in groups.

<p>Have your future teachers design lesson on budgeting that incorporates percentage and data 
display. There are several chart generators at 
<a href="http://nces.ed.gov/nceskids/createagraph/default.aspx" target="_blank">
Create a graph</a> at the National Center for Education Statistics. </p>

<h2><a name="thpni13">THPNI13</a></h2>

This calculation leads naturally to a discussion of whether Thomas can live on his budgeted 
amount. Most younger people are not really aware of what stuff costs: the apartment, 
the electricity, the heat, etc.  If you want to spend some time on the topic of budgeting, 
we suggest the following strategy.
<ul>
<li>As a class, make a list of all household expenses

<li>Give small groups one of these expenses to estimate.  For example, a group could contact 
the local energy company for data on electricity usage and rates over time.  Each of 
these estimates should be presented in written form with supporting data, for the rest of 
the class to use.  In the interests of quantitative literacy, we should make every excuse 
to have students write about calculations and data.

<li>Putting all of this information together will give an estimate for a household budget.
</ul>
How well will Thomas's paycheck cover expenses?

 
<h2><a name="thpni14">THPNI14</a></h2>

<p>This video could spark a discussion of how people handle windfalls.  An influx of unexpected 
cash is very easy to spend, because the recipient thinks of it as "extra" or "free".  But the 
young woman in the video actually had to earn that money.
</p>
<p>"Opportunity cost" refers to opportunities lost when a resource is used on one thing, and 
therefore can't be used on something else.  In this case there are at least three ways to 
think about the money this woman spent.</p>
<ul>
<li>How long did she have to work to earn that money?  This is a cost in time that could 
have been spent doing something more fun or worthwhile.

<li>If she were to invest her tax refund at 3% (or some other rate of) interest for five 
years, what would she have at the end of it?

<li>If she just saved the money as a safety measure, what kinds of unforeseen expenses could she pay? 
</ul>
