<h2><a href="FLCar.php.html">Jetta or Jaguar? Buying your Ideal Car</a> - Outline</h2>

<p>
Slides are tagged by opening line.
<ol>
<li>"You're going to graduate" opens the discussion by inviting an emotional response to car ownership.
<li>"What is your ideal car?" asks the class to consider as many aspects of a car as possible, many of which will be financial.
<li>"Choose two cars" has students pick two cars to compare financially.
<li>"Did you find some good options?" looks at the cost of car insurance and asks students to list other expenses they will encounter.
<li>"Now that you have" asks students to estimate all of these expenses, using the calculation for monthly cost of gasoline as an example.
<li>"What is the monthly cost" has students consider the cost of financing their vehicle, with a cautionary example.
<li>"To make sure you avoid" introduces a spreadsheet and a worksheet for figuring loan payments.  These are core activities for students.
<li>"Notice the column" has students compare the remaining amount owed on the car to the value of the car over the period of the loan.
<li>"One risk in taking out a car loan" explains why it may be risky to have a loan during periods when the value of the car is less than the amount owed.
<li>"More about the upside down" has further explanation.
<li>"So, can you afford" asks the larger budgeting question.
<li>"Compare the impact" asks students to compare the most and least expensive alternatives they have found.
<li>"Fantasy and imagination" concedes that we may always want more than we can afford, concluding with a bit of humor.
