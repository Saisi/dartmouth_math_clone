<h1>Modules</h1>

<h2>Earning:</h2>

<div style="margin:0px 50px 0px 50px;">
<p>
<a href="FLTakeHome.php.html"><b>How much will I take home?</b></a> Based on the first pay stub a 
new teacher will receive, this module leads the student to understand all of the withheld pay, 
what it is for, and why it is withheld.  In particular, it looks at voluntary contributions 
to 401K plans and asks students to consider the present and future implications of making 
small contributions early in the career.</p>
<p>
<a href="FLhouseholdbudget.html"><b>Paddle Your Canoe</b></a> Based on the typical household budget for a recent 
college graduate, this module helps students see where the money goes and how to control it.  
A very basic spreadsheet introduces students to the use of this tool.</p>
<p>
<a href="FLtaxes.php.html"><b>You've Got To Hand It To Them</b></a> Learn the basics of 
taxation, such as the various types of taxes, how they are collected, what they pay for, 
and what happens if you do not pay them.  A spreadsheet introduces students to the 
federal income tax deduction.</p>
</div>

<h2>Spending:</h2>

<div style="margin:0px 50px 0px 50px;">
<p>
<a href="FLCreditCardOffers.php.html"><b>Understanding Credit Card Offers</b></a> Based on a 
typical department store offer of 10% off the price of your purchase for opening a credit 
card, this module poses the question: Is it a good deal?  Students will use online calculators 
and spreadsheets to explore the workings of interest, various payment strategies, and 
competing card offers.</p>
<p>
<a href="FLCar.php.html"><b>Jetta or Jaguar? Buying your ideal car</b></a>  In this module students 
will compare car purchases, including estimating and budgeting for all related expenses 
(insurance, repairs, gas), depreciation, and various loan options.  A spreadsheet reveals 
the relationship of principal remaining on a car loan to depreciation, and the "upside down" loan.</p>
<a href="FLbuyinghouse.html"><b>Buy, Rent, or Live in a Tent?</b></a> In this module we explore the process and 
finances of home purchase, so that students understand the expectations of mortgage lenders as 
well as the impact of owning house on their own budgets.</p>

</div>

<h2>Saving and Investing:</h2>

<div style="margin:0px 50px 0px 50px;">
<p>
<a href="FLinvestsavings.html"><b>Investing in Savings and Bonds</b></a> This module explores how money grows over 
time in a savings account, and extends the discussion to savings bonds and treasury bills, which 
are also conservative mechanisms for growing wealth.</p>
<p>
<a href="FLinveststocks.html"><b>Investing in the Stock Market</b></a>
Buying and selling stocks online is as simple as ordering from an online store.  So it is 
imperative that students understand the stock marketâ€”what it is, how it works, the risks and 
advantages of using it. This module serves as an introduction to buying and selling stock directly 
using online services.</p>
<p>
<a href="FLinvestmutualfunds.html"><b>Investing in Mutual Funds</b></a> Mutual funds are an alternative to investing 
directly in stocks or bonds, allowing the consumer to purchase shares of a fund representing a 
variety of separate investments.  This module explains how these work, how fees and other charges 
vary among them and why you might want to use them.</p>

</div>

<h2>Planning for Retirement NOW:</h2>

<div style="margin:0px 50px 0px 50px;">
<p>
<a href="FLparentswillmovein.html"><b>Your Parents Will Move In With You!</b></a> How much money does a couple need to 
retire? This module leads the students through a set of calculations that mimic those done by 
financial advisors in search of an answer for their clients.</p>

<a href="FLSavingRetirement.html"><b>Saving For Retirement</b></a> This module asks and answers a simple question.  
If you want to have a certain amount of money in a certain number of years, how much do you have 
to invest every year?  And how does it depend on the rate of return of your investments?  This 
module allows students to discover the benefits of starting early.</p>
