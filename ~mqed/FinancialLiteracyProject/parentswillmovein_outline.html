<ol>
   <li> &ldquo;The beginning&rdquo; is a humorous video of a man whose in-laws are about to move in to his home.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;This could happen to you&rdquo; is a more serious look at the reality of the situation.</li>
   <li> &ldquo;How much do your parents need&rdquo; initiates the question of saving for retirement.</li>
   <li> &ldquo;Let's assume that&rdquo; structures a problem around a specific scenario.</li>
   <li> &ldquo;Assuming no raises, other than to match inflation&rdquo; asks students to calculate future wages.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;Year 1&rdquo; explains this calculation through iteration.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;Or in formula form&rdquo; does the general calculation with alternative notation.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;You should get&rdquo; gives the answer so students can check their work.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;The current insurance tables suggest&rdquo; explains how long a retired couple (or person) might need to live off their savings and does a basic calculation.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;That is a lot of money&rdquo; points out that keeping a sum invested means that the initial amount need not be as great, and sets up a problem.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;So in the year that they retire&rdquo; sets up the math of interest plus annual withdrawals on an account.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;What about year 2?&rdquo; does one more iteration and asks the students to do one also.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;How about M25?&rdquo;  shows the generalization of that iteration to 25 years time.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;Let's remember a fact from basic algebra&rdquo; reminds students of the formula for the sum of consecutive powers of x.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;So in the formula&rdquo; applies this algebra to the formula in slide 13.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;In our case, W= 130,000 and i = .07&rdquo;  asks students to plug in the numbers and figure out what needs to be invested at retirement.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;What do you get?&rdquo; shows the answer.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;But now we have a problem&rdquo; introduces the problem of varying returns on an investment.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;How can we take random variation into account?&rdquo;  reminds students of the formula for salary after 25 years of raises based on inflation.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;If the inflation rate and corresponding raise is .02&rdquo; leads students to a worksheet and spreadsheet incorporating random fluctuations in the cost of living raise.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;The 7% estimate for investment returns&rdquo; writes investment returns minus withdrawals in an iterative fashion as a spreadsheet would do it.  It is asking the students where the random fluctuation should be incorporated.</li>
   <li>.&rdquo; And how would you create the spreadsheet?&rdquo; describes how to use the spreadsheet to see the effects of randomness.</li>
   <li>&ldquo;If you help your parents understand&rdquo; points out the value of planning ahead.  The video helps students see that their parents don't want to move in with them either.</li>
