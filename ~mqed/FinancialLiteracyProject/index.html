<a class="customh2" href="index.html">The Financial Literacy Initiative at Dartmouth College</a>
<p>
A project of the Center for Mathematics and Quantitative Education at Dartmouth and the 
Financial Literacy Center.</p>
<p>
The Financial Literacy Initiative at Dartmouth College advocates a quantitative approach 
to financial literacy for college students, K-12 students, future teachers and adult learners.  
The initiative supports this approach through contextually rich curriculum modules for 
classroom use, short video presentations for faculty development or classroom discussion, and 
case studies.  All materials are freely available through online publication.  Links to these 
are found below.</p>

<h2>Modules:</h2>

<div style="margin:0px 50px 0px 50px;">
<p>
A series of ten quantitative modules allows you and your students or workshop participants to 
explore the financial aspects of earning, spending, saving and investing.  Each module includes 
an online slide presentation including videos and useful links.  The presentation is supported by 
a set of online instructor notes suggesting activities, exercises, discussion questions and 
directions for further study or research.  Also available online are spreadsheets and worksheets 
for students (and instructors) to use.  Each module also has an associated case study and 
assessment tool, available upon request from <a href="mailto:audrey.brown@dartmouth.edu">Audrey 
Brown</a>.</p>
<p>
Modules may be used flexibly in conjunction with a variety of courses.  They may be used 
independently to support an entire course, with student activities supporting about four 
classroom hours of work plus independent assignments.  Alternatively they may be included as 
part of a course emphasizing developmental mathematics, quantitative literacy, college algebra, 
or financial literacy.</p>

<h2>Basic Mathematics through Financial Literacy:</h2>

<div style="margin:0px 50px 0px 50px;">
<p>
This text is intended to be the basis for an alternative basic mathematics course based on real 
financial decisions everyone will have to make. A large proportion of entering college students 
are required to take and pass such a course as prerequisite to college level subjects. Largely 
a review of elementary and high school mathematics, this course is known to have limited success 
as a conduit to college. Financial literacy provides an entry point to the same material that 
benefits from its relevance to daily life. </p>

</div>

<h2>Video presentations for faculty development and classroom discussion:</h2>

<div style="margin:0px 50px 0px 50px;">
<p>
Seven videos support faculty development and discussion. Four short videos support presentations 
and discussions about how financial literacy topics fit 
naturally into a quantitative reasoning course.  Three more short case studies provide an 
opportunity to look at specific financial scenarios. </p>
