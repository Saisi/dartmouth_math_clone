 <h2> Paddle Your Own Canoe<br />
  Constructing a Household Budget</h2>

  <p>According to a US Department of Labor 
  <a href="http://www.creditloan.com/infographics/how-the-average-consumer-spends-their-paycheck/" target="blank">survey</a> , 
  the American household spent an average of $6,372 on food and $16,895 on housing in 2009.  
  These represented 12.99% and 34.43% of household income respectively.  How likely is the average person to be aware of their personal spending?  Some sources report that only 40% of U.S. households have a budget and more than 20% keep no track at all of where their money goes. </p> 

<p>  This is a case where knowledge certainly is power.  <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre19.shtm" target="blank">The Federal Trade Commission</a> recommends developing a budget as &ldquo;the first step toward taking control of your financial situation&rdquo;.  In this module, students will do just that as they become acquainted with typical household expenses and the options life offers for compromise.</p>

<p>We suggest that instructors open the <a href="householdbudgetnotes.html" target="blank">instructor notes</a> for this module, save them as a PDF file, and print them for reference.</p>

<p>This module also includes assessment tools (pre and post test) and a case study for deeper investigation of this topic. These resources are available by contacting <a href="mailto:audrey.brown@dartmouth.edu}">Audrey Brown
</a>.</p>
