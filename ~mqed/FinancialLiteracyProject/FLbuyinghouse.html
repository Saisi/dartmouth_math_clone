 <h2>Buy, Rent, or Live in a Tent?<br />
  Mortgages and House Purchase</h2>



  <p>
  The U.S. Census Bureau reported (2009) that about 67% of all housing units in the U.S. were owner occupied.  Home ownership is a recognized part of the American Dream, and is subsidized through by the government through mortgage loans and tax deductions.  An impressive 93% of married couples between 70 and 74 owned their houses.  Almost everybody eventually purchases a house.
  </p>

  <p>
  But the decision to do so must be made carefully.  For most people, their house will be the biggest purchase ever made and the largest loan ever taken.  The <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/creditconditions/" target="blank">Federal Reserve Bank of NY</a> reports (as of this writing)  about 5% of homeowners more than 90 days delinquent on mortgage payments and therefore in danger of foreclosure.  
  </p>

  <p>
  In this module we explore the process of financing and purchasing a home so that students 
  understand the expectations of mortgage lenders and the impact that owning a house has on a budget.
  </p>
  <p>We suggest that instructors open the <a href="buyinghouse_notes.html" target="blank">instructor notes</a> for this module, save them as a PDF file, and print them for reference.</p>

  <p>This module also includes assessment tools (pre and post test) and a case study for deeper investigation of this topic. These resources are available by contacting <a href="mailto:audrey.brown@dartmouth.edu}">Audrey Brown
  </a>.</p>
