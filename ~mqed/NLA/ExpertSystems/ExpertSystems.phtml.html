Sloan Foundation. TheNLA Program had the goal of assisting in the introduction ofquantitative reasoning and concepts of modern technology within liberaleducation. The Program was based on the conviction that collegegraduates should have been introduced to both areas if they are to livein the social mainstream and participate in the resolution of policyissues. The Center for Mathematics and Quantitative Education isdelighted to make these monographs available.</FONT>		</td>		</tr>		</table><table border="0"><tr><td width="550" background="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~mqed/NLA/image/plant42.gif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><P ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+3">EXPERT SYSTEMS:<BR>  Basic Concepts</FONT><BR> Joseph D.

With this in mind, thismodule is written to present the basic concepts underlying the generalfield of artificial intelligence and highlight the techniques employedin the development of knowledge-based expert systems.</P><P ALIGN="left">The math includes, logic, neural nets, truth tables, hard countingproblems, and development of computer algorithms.</P>
