Sloan Foundation. TheNLA Program had the goal of assisting in the introduction ofquantitative reasoning and concepts of modern technology within liberaleducation. The Program was based on the conviction that collegegraduates should have been introduced to both areas if they are to livein the social mainstream and participate in the resolution of policyissues. The Center for Mathematics and Quantitative Education isdelighted to make these monographs available.</FONT>		</td>		</tr>		</table>		<table border="0"><tr><td width="550" background="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~mqed/NLA/image/plant237.1.gif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><P ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+3">AN INTRODUCTION TO DYNAMIC SYSTEMSAND MATHEMATICAL MODELLING</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="+2"></FONT><BR><BR>Donal O'Shca<BR> Mount Holyoke Collcge </P>		<P ALIGN="left">The primary aim of this monograph is to expose some models whichhave been central in the development of mathematical modelling and whichexemplify the process of using mathematics to understand the world. The authorshows how mathematics can be, and is, used as a speculative tool. Computerexploration makes this exploratory side of mathematics accessible to studentswith a solid high school background.</P><P ALIGN="left">The monograph focuses primarily on dynamical systems, which threecenturies of experience have shown to be the most useful class of mathematicalmodels. Historically, the discovery and use of dynamical systems have beeninlimately bound up with the calculus and considerable knowledge of calculushas been required to use them effectively. Thc current monograph supposes <I>no</I>knowledge of calculus. Instead, the computer is used to explore the behavior ofdynamical systems.</P><P ALIGN="center"><I>Chapler Coverage</I></P><UL>	<LI>Model of snakes on Guam	<LI>Ecological models including species in symbiosis and predatorprey models	<LI>Dynamical systems including state space, equilibrium points, and limit cycles	<LI>Greatest mathematical model—Kepler, Galileo, and Newton	<LI>Dynamical systems and determinism including structural stability and chaotic systems</UL><P ALIGN="left">This is written from the mathematical viewpoint.
