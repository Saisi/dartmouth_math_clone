Sloan Foundation. TheNLA Program had the goal of assisting in the introduction ofquantitative reasoning and concepts of modern technology within liberaleducation. The Program was based on the conviction that collegegraduates should have been introduced to both areas if they are to livein the social mainstream and participate in the resolution of policyissues. The Center for Mathematics and Quantitative Education isdelighted to make these monographs available.</FONT>		</td>		</tr>		</table>		<table border="0"><tr><td width="550" background="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~mqed/NLA/image/plant34.gif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><P ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+3">Rates of Change: </FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="+2">Modelling Population and Resources</FONT><BR><BR>Eva Paus, Economics Department<BR>Harriet Pollatsek, Department of Mathematics, Statistics and Computation<BR>Mount Holyoke College</P>		<P ALIGN="left">This is the subject of the present monograph. A crucial element in theteaching of this unit is the program STELLA by High Performance Systems.By the use of clever visual icons, STELLA permits the student to modeldynamical systems of considerable complexity without the explicit use ofcalculus. The central visual metaphor is "plumbing." Quantities thatgrow or shrink appear as the contents of "bathtubs." "Pipes" feed intoand out of the tubs, each with a "valve" which determines the rate ofincrease or decrease. These rates may, in turn, depend on otherquantities in the system in a variety of ways.</P><P ALIGN="left">This text allows student to approach problems normally reserved forthose with a calculus background. Lots of discussion questions andexercises are included.  The background, material for various topics ispresented at a beginners level. Further reading would allow a moresophisticated approach to the topics. A user who does not have access toSTELLA would have to rework the exercises in their own choice ofsoftware.</P>
