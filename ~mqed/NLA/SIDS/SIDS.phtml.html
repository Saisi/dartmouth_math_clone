Sloan Foundation. TheNLA Program had the goal of assisting in the introduction ofquantitative reasoning and concepts of modern technology within liberaleducation. The Program was based on the conviction that collegegraduates should have been introduced to both areas if they are to livein the social mainstream and participate in the resolution of policyissues. The Center for Mathematics and Quantitative Education isdelighted to make these monographs available.</FONT>		</td>		</tr>		</table><table border="0"><tr><td width="550" background="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~mqed/NLA/image/plant661.gif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><P ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+3">RESEARCHING THE SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME (SIDS)</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="+2">The Role of Ideology in Biomedical Science</FONT><BR> James J. McKenna<BR>University of Notre Dame</P><P ALIGN="left">This monograph will review what is known about the SIDS puzzle and someof the factors that make it so difficult to solve. In addition todescribing the inherent methodological problems that arise when noconsistent clinical markers, either before or after the infant's death,can be identified, the author uses his experiences in this research areato comment on the sociocultural factors that play a significant role inshaping and sometimes constraining the SIDS research paradigm.</P><P ALIGN="left">The author attempts to demonstrate 1) physiologically significantchanges in the sleep experiences of solitary and social sleeping infantsand 2) that the changes found (presuming they are real) are peninent tounderstanding suspected infantile deficits thought to be involved insome SIDS instances.</P><P ALIGN="left">Some of the more specific questions posed include: What kinds ofphysiological changes in arousals and breathing and hean rates doparents and infants have as a result of contact with each otherthroughout the night? Perhaps the kind of sensory communication such asbreathing sounds, smells, sudden movements, breathing movements of thechest, and/or touch, reduces the number of breathing pauses, orincreases arousals in infants, or simply prevents infants from sleepingin deep stages or from having apneas?</P><P ALIGN="left">The mathematics is very elementary, consisting mostly of bar charts. There are no math problems provided by the author. The language is sophisticated and may be a barrier to younger students. The text provides enough background information for statistics students to engage in experimental design problems.</P><P ALIGN="left"> The Author also has a website <A HREF="http://www.nd.edu/~alfac/mckenna">Mother-Baby Behavioral Sleep Laboratory .</A>which contains material relevant to this monograph.</P>
