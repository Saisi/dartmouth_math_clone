Sloan Foundation. TheNLA Program had the goal of assisting in the introduction ofquantitative reasoning and concepts of modern technology within liberaleducation. The Program was based on the conviction that collegegraduates should have been introduced to both areas if they are to livein the social mainstream and participate in the resolution of policyissues. The Center for Mathematics and Quantitative Education isdelighted to make these monographs available.</FONT>		</td>		</tr>		</table><table border="0"><tr><td width="550" background="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~mqed/NLA/image/plant885.gif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><P ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+3">INFORMATION THEORY</FONT><BR> Morton Tavel<BR>Vassar College</P><P ALIGN="left">Unlike most other areas in the natural sciences, the roots ofInformation Theory are truly multidisciplinary, originating in physics,psychology, statistics and communications engineering. What, then, isinformation theory and why has it influenced such a wide range ofdiscip1ines? To answer this question, we need a discussion of theconcept of "information," which is the subject matter of the theoryitself.</P><P ALIGN="left">Information is the reduction of uncertainty. Notice that knowledge hasnot exactly been removed from the picture, but it has been given ahighly restrictive meaning: reduction of uncertainty. Certainlyknowledge can make you more sure of things, but we would ordinarilybelieve that knowledge is more than simply being less uncertain. We mustjust accept the fact that all those nuances of knowledge that go beyondmere assurance have not been quantified.</P><P ALIGN="left">With the use of highly imaginative examples, Professor Tavel provides aneasily understood explanation of Information Theory.</P><P ALIGN="left">The discussion in this text relies on basic probability as well as an understanding of logarithms and binary numbers. It includes an application of information theory to DNA sequencing.</P>
