Sloan Foundation. TheNLA Program had the goal of assisting in the introduction ofquantitative reasoning and concepts of modern technology within liberaleducation. The Program was based on the conviction that collegegraduates should have been introduced to both areas if they are to livein the social mainstream and participate in the resolution of policyissues. The Center for Mathematics and Quantitative Education isdelighted to make these monographs available.</FONT>		</td>		</tr>		</table>		<table border="0"><tr><td width="550" background="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~mqed/NLA/image/plant273.3.gif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><P ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+3">FROM RULE-OF- THUMB TO SCIENTIFIC ENGINEERING</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="+2"></FONT><BR><BR>James B. Francis and The Invention of the Francis Turbine<BR>Edwin T. Lay ton, Jr.<BR> University of Minnesota<BR>  </P>		<P ALIGN="left">James B. Francis (1815-1892) was a British-bom engineer who helpedto shirt engineering in America from a craft to a scientific base. He linkedengineering firmly to experimental inquiry of a scientific nature. He wasassociated with America's most important early center of textile manufacturing,Lowell, Massachusetts. In its carly stages thc factory system relicd mainly uponwatcr power, and COttOn textile manufacturing was at the culling edge or theIndustrial Revolution. Francis was one or the foremost figures in thedevelopment and effective use or water power at Lowell and elsewhere.</P><P ALIGN="left">This monograph discusses Francis' experimental work which wasdevoted to the measurement of the flow of water. Sometimes this was inconnection with power production by turbines, at other times it related to thecanal system which distributed water to the manufacturing companies at Lowell,and at other times it involved metering the amount of water used by the varioustextile factories at Lowell. It was in measuring water that Francis made some orhis most notable (and still useful) contributions to engineering.</P><P ALIGN="left">The study of hydraulics relies on a collection of algebraic relationsset out at the start of this interesting text. There are used repeatedlythroughout the ensuing discussions of canal design, turbines andhydraulic experiments. There is also a small problem set at the end ofthe text.</P>
