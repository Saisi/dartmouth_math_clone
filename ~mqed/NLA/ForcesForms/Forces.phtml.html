Sloan Foundation. TheNLA Program had the goal of assisting in the introduction ofquantitative reasoning and concepts of modern technology within liberaleducation. The Program was based on the conviction that collegegraduates should have been introduced to both areas if they are to livein the social mainstream and participate in the resolution of policyissues. The Center for Mathematics and Quantitative Education isdelighted to make these monographs available.</FONT>		</td>		</tr>		</table><table border="0"><tr><td width="550" background="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~mqed/NLA/image/plant359.gif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><P ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+3">FORCES AND FORMS<BR>IN LARGE STRUCTURES</FONT><BR><BR> Alfonso M.

His discussion includes such topics asbridge loading, bending moment calculations, and prestressing cables.</P><P ALIGN="left">The mathematics is an application of basic algebra to calculate physicalquantities as well as an application of vectors to describe force.</P>
