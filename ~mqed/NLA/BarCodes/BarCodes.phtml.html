Sloan Foundation. TheNLA Program had the goal of assisting in the introduction ofquantitative reasoning and concepts of modern technology within liberaleducation. The Program was based on the conviction that collegegraduates should have been introduced to both areas if they are to livein the social mainstream and participate in the resolution of policyissues. The Center for Mathematics and Quantitative Education isdelighted to make these monographs available.</FONT>		</td>		</tr>		</table>		<table border="0"><tr><td width="550" background="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~mqed/NLA/image/plant34.gif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><P ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+3">BAR CODES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="+2"></FONT><BR><BR>Marian Visich, Jr.<BR>SUNY at Stony Brook</P>		<P ALIGN="left">In 1970, a grocery industry committee was formed to develop a standardcode that could be used to identify retail items. The objective was to develop asymbol that could be read in either direction by an optical scanner to automatecheck out transactions and inventory control. The effort concluded with theselection of the Universal Product Code (UPC) symbol as the industrY standardin April 1973.</P><P ALIGN="left">Once the UPC proved to be a success in the grocery industry, bar codeswere introduced in many other industries as a fast and accurate method ofcollecting information about products, documents or people. Today bar codes areused in manufacturing plants, on shipping cartons, in hospitals and libraries andon mail to automate the United States Postal System.</P><P ALIGN="left">When bar codes were being introduced in the 1970's, over 50 differentbar codes were developed to satisfy the requirements of various industries, Inthis monograph, the six most popular bar code symbologies are presented.</P><P ALIGN="left">Bar code scanning systems are described and various bar codeapplications are presented. Automation of supermarkets and the United StatesPostal System is described in detail followed by a discussion of a wide range ofother applications—from manufacturing to the feeding of cows.</P><P ALIGN="left">The math in this volume includes modular arithmetic and a simple error correcting code. </P>
