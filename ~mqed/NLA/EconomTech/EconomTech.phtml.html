Sloan Foundation. TheNLA Program had the goal of assisting in the introduction ofquantitative reasoning and concepts of modern technology within liberaleducation. The Program was based on the conviction that collegegraduates should have been introduced to both areas if they are to livein the social mainstream and participate in the resolution of policyissues. The Center for Mathematics and Quantitative Education isdelighted to make these monographs available.</FONT>		</td>		</tr>		</table>		<table border="0"><tr><td width="550" background="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~mqed/NLA/image/art7.gif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><P ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+3">THE ECONOMICS OF TECHNOLOGY</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="+2"></FONT><BR><BR>Vincent H.

Examples from a widevariety of technologies and industries are used to illustrate the issues involved,many of which are drawn from other monographs in the NLA monograph series.In addition, the monograph is self-eontained in that all of the economic conceptsthat are utilized are first introduced and cxplained. The monograph is thereforeweIl-suited for undergraduate economics courses that include an examination ofthe economics of technical change.</P><P ALIGN="left">Among the topics covered are. decisions by firms to utilize existingtechnologies, consequences of government intervention in the process oftechnical change, implications of technical innovation for the economic welfareof diffcrent groups in society, the extent of direct government support andsubsidies for research and development in the U.S., the usefulness of benefit costanalysis and technology assessment, and examination of the question of whetheror not the recent world wide slowdown in the rate of economic and productivitygrowth has been caused by a slowdown in the rate of technical change.</P><P ALIGN="left">This volume makes a lot of use of summation notation and reading andinterpretation of graphs of algebraic relationships. Discussionquestions are included with each chapter, although most are not of aquantitative nature.</P>
