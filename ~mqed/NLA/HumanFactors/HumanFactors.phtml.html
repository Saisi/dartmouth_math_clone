Sloan Foundation. TheNLA Program had the goal of assisting in the introduction ofquantitative reasoning and concepts of modern technology within liberaleducation. The Program was based on the conviction that collegegraduates should have been introduced to both areas if they are to livein the social mainstream and participate in the resolution of policyissues. The Center for Mathematics and Quantitative Education isdelighted to make these monographs available.</FONT>		</td>		</tr>		</table><table border="0"><tr><td width="550" background="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~mqed/NLA/image/plant943.gif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><P ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+3">Human Factors<BR>in the Design of Spacecraft</FONT><BR> Harvey Wichman<BR>Aerospace Psychology Laboratory<BR>Claremont McKenna Colleges</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN="left">"Reading is more effective and pleasant when the reader knows what toanticipate. That anticipation is what I want to accomplish in thispreface. Let me begin by telling you what this monograph is not. It isnot a history of the U.S. space program, nor a human factors textbooknor a science and technology textbook. However, when you have finishedreading it you will have had a thumbnail sketch of the history of thespace program. You will also have a pretty good idea of what humanfactors is all about and especially its applications in aviation andspace. Finally, if I have been successffil, you will have had your fancytickled by some of the issues of science and technology that I haveshared with you.</P><P ALIGN="left">The first chapter tells the meaning of the terms human factors andergonomics, and goes on to tell a bit about the early developments inthe fields. Each of the following chapters is an essay dealing with abit of the history of spaceflight as it was manifested in the design ofa specific vehicle or group of vehicles. I have selected an assortmentof human factors issues to illustrate both the breadth and depth of thediscipline, but this does not come close to being an exhaustivecharacterization. I hope that some of my enthusiasm for human factorswork rubs off because you too are intrigued by the non-intuitive, anddelight in finding elegant solutions to unexpected problems."</P><P ALIGN="right">H.W.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN="left">The mathematics is elementary arithmetic, scale changes, units andmeasurement. No problems are provided, but it would be easy to think ofsome. It gives the reader an idea of what is feels like to be anastronaut. The text includes an excellent discussion of vomiting inspace. Teachers of younger students could use this as the basis fora lesson even though the reading level is too high.</font>
