I am a fifth-year graduate student in the Department of Mathematics at Dartmouth College.  I graduated from Hampshire College in 2009 and received a masters degree from Dartmouth College in 2011.  My advisor is <a href="../~carlp/index.html">Carl Pomerance</a>, and my research interests are in elementary analytic number theory and anatomy of integers.

<b> teaching </b>
<br><br>

I am currently a <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~academicoutreach/gk12/">GK-12</a> fellow for the 2013-2014 school year.  Through this NSF sponsered program, I work closely with Jeanine King at Hanover High School in designing and implementing creative inquiry based lessons for high school students.
<br><br>

During the 2012 Fall quarter, I taught <a href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m31f12">Math 31</a>, Abstract Algebra.  Halloween was a particularly tough class for me.  I had <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/tetrahedron2.jpg">difficulty</a> in moving my arms and lacked a <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/tetrahedron.jpg">subgroup</a> of index 2.
<br><br>

During the 2012 Winter quarter, I taught <a href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m2w12">Math 2</a>, Calculus with Algebra and Trigonometry.
