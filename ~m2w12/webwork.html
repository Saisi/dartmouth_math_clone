<h2><font color="DarkSlateGray">General Information about WeBWorK</font></h2> 
 
<h3 style="color:DarkSlateGray"> I. What is WeBWorK ? </h3> 
 
<em>WeBWorK</em> is a system that allows students to do their homework
in an interactive web-based environment.
 
<br> 
<br> 
Using <em>WeBWorK</em>, students may try to answer homework problems
more than once.  After each try, a message appears telling the student
whether the answer is correct or not.  This provides immediate
feedback to the students, allows them to discover what they did wrong,
and hopefully alows them to understand the topic of the question
better.
<br> 
<br> 
Each <EM>WeBWorK</EM> problem set is individualized. Each student has
a different version of a problem generated from a fixed template; for
example the numerical values in the formulas may be slightly
different). <p><p> 
 
<H3 style="color:DarkSlateGray"> II.  How to use WeBWorK to do your homework</H3><p><p> 
 
  Using <EM>WeBWorK</EM> is quite simple.<BR> 
  
 Below are the basic steps on how to get started.<BR><BR> 
  <STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> Most pages of <EM>WeBWorK</EM> also contain
  directions.  Therefore, if you are ever unsure of what you should
  do, try reading the directions and descriptions on the page at which
  you are looking.<BR> 
 
<ul> 
<li><p>You can use any computer with a browser like Firefox or Opera. <br></p> </li> 
 
<li><p>Open your browser and go to the main <em>WeBWorK</em> page, address <a href="https://webwork.dartmouth.edu/webwork2/m2w12/"> 
   https://webwork.dartmouth.edu/webwork2/m2w12/</a>.<br></p> </li> 
  
<li><p>This will get you to the main page of your course.  This page
  includes necessary information about logging in. To log in, click on the 'Login' button.<br></p></li> 
 
<li><p>This will take you to a login page.  Enter your
  login name and password, and click on the 'Continue' button.<br> 
  <ul> 
  <li>Your <strong>login name</strong> is the usually just your last name,
  followed possibly by a digit for people in the class with the same
  last name (e.g. smith, smith2, ...). Possible exceptions include
  compound last names like "den Hartog" or "De La Huerta," which would
  be rendered Hartog and Huerta, respectively.</li> 
 
  <li>Your initial <strong>password</strong> is (unless you gave me
  something else) your six-character student ID number. </li> 
  </ul> 
  </p></li> 
 
<li><p>If your login is incorrect, you will be told so, and you can
  return to the login page and try again.</p> 
 
<li><p>If you are registered for the course, you should receive an email
  from your instructor confirming your login and password. If your login is
  correct, you will see a page where you can do following:
  
  <ul> 
  <li><p><strong>Look at and do the problems in a set via your web browser.</strong><br> 
  
  To do the first day's assignment, for example, click on the line in
  the box that starts with 'Section 1.1'.  Then click on the 'Do problem
  set' button.<br> On each line in the box (where all the sets are
  listed), you can see whether the set is open or closed. If the set is 
  listed as open, any problems you solve will be counted toward your grade.  
  If the set is closed, you can still solve problems, but your results will 
  not be recorded. After the indication of whether the set is open or
  closed, there is additional information about the due date (if the
  set is open), or whether the answers are available (if the set is
  closed).  </p></li> 
 
<!-- 
When the answers are available, you have the option of
  looking at correct answers when viewing a problem.
--> 
  
  
  <li><p><strong>Get a printout of the problem set.</strong><br> 
 
  To print out Section 1.1, for example, first choose the download type.
  The default output is a pdf file. After choosing one of the download 
  types, click on the line in the box that starts with 'Section 1.1...'.  
  Then click on the 'Get hard copy' button. If your browser is capable of 
  displaying pdf files, the problem list will appear and you can print it 
  directly from your browser. If not, you can save the file to your hard 
  drive and print it from a pdf viewer (such as Adobe Acrobat Reader).
  </p></li> 
    
  
  <li><p><strong>Look at a summary of your WeBWorK homework
  scores.</strong><br> This is the second section of the page.  If you
  click on the button 'Get Summary', you will see your current scores
  for all available problem sets.</p></li>  
  </ul></p></li> 
  
  <li><p>If you are printing out a problem set or looking at a summary of
  your homework scores, you are done.  If you are viewing a problem
  set via your web browser, you will see a page with the problems in the set
  you chose.  To view and/or answer a problem, click on the number of
  the problem and click on the 'Get Problem' button.  Notice that
  there are four modes of viewing the problem: 'text', 'formatted-text', 
  'typeset', and 'typeset2'.  It is best to view the problem using 
  'typeset2' mode, which should be the default. Once you choose a problem 
  and click on the 'Get Problem' button, you will see the text of the 
  problem along with boxes for your answers.  Enter your answers and click 
  on the 'Submit Answer' button.  If you are working on a problem set that 
  is already closed, you will have the option to see the correct answer or a 
  solution if one is available (currently only a few problems have solutions 
  available).  To see the correct answer and/or solution, just check the 
  box(es) and click on the 'Submit Answer' button (you do not have to enter 
  an answer to see the correct answer or solution).  Once you have submitted 
  an answer, you will be told whether your answer is correct or not.  If 
  not, you can try again.  After you've tried a problem, you can either go 
  to the next problem, the previous problem, or see the list of the
  problems again.<br></p></li> 
 
<li><p>If you want to check the status of your problems (for example, to 
  double check that your answers have been recorded), use the &quot;Prob. 
  List&quot; button at the top of the page to see the problem list 
  page.<br></p></li> 
 
<li> When you are finished, log out using the &quot;Logout&quot; button at 
  the bottom of the page.
</ul> 
  
<h3 style="color:DarkSlateGray"> IV.  Important facts to know </h3> 
 
<ul> 
  <li><p><strong>What to do if you have problems with WeBWorK:</strong><br> 
  
<ul><li>If you have a problem logging in, contact your instructor.</li> 
  
  <li>If you have a problem printing out a set, ask a consultant at a  
  computer lab.  If you don't get sufficient help, contact your instructor 
  or TA.</li>  
  
  <li>If you have questions on specific homework problems or if you have 
  comments about <EM>WeBWorK</EM> that you think can help us make 
  <EM>WeBWorK</EM> better, click on the 'Feedback' button on any of the 
  pages of <EM>WeBWorK</EM>.</li> 
</ul></p></li> 
  
<li>If you are logged on to <EM>WeBWorK</EM> for longer that 30 minutes 
  without any activity, you will be asked to log in again.  This is a 
  security measure. You can resume your work after you logged back in.  All 
  your results from the last log in will be saved.</li>

<h2 style="color:DarkSlateGray"> Some Notes on WeBWorK </h2> 
 
The main advantage of WeBWorK is that it provides you with instant feedback on your answers to problems. You can see immediately whether your answer is right or wrong, and you have the opportunity to retry the problem until you get it right. Unfortunately, it can become easy to obsess over getting the right answer, while losing sight of the mathematical concepts in the process. Therefore, we have put together a list of suggestions regarding the way in which you should approach WeBWorK.
 
<ul> 
 
<li><p> In order to succeed in this course, it will help you greatly to keep a written record of your work. Therefore, we suggest that you keep a ``WeBWorK notebook'' where you can keep track of your work. Even though the instructors will not see your notebook, it will help you when studying for quizzes and exams if you can look back and see how you approached the homework problems.<br></p></li> 
 
<li><p> For each problem, write out your work as if you are explaining it to a classmate. Make sure you understand each step - ask yourself why it makes sense, and if the answer is not immediate, record it in your notebook.<br></p></li> 
 
<li><p> If you enter your answer into WeBWorK and it is correct, great. However, make sure that you know <em>why</em> it is correct before moving on. <br></p></li> 
 
<li><p> If your answer is incorrect, it is tempting to try altering details (such as negative signs) directly in WeBWorK until you get the right answer. If you do this, you should make sure that you understand <em>why</em> these changes worked. Again, make sure you record your work.
