<p>Wheelock Books has informed me that the text is now in stock.</p>

<p> We meet MWF at 11:15, and in 343 Kemeny.  (<b>PLEASE NOTE THE NEW ROOM</b>)
</p>

<p>Homework due Wednesday, November 9:<br>
Ch. 6, #3.

			<p style="text-align : justify">
Primes and Polynomials:<br>
This course will develop elementary estimates on the distribution
of prime numbers, including elementary sieve methods.  A recurrent
theme will be the prime factorization of integer-polynomial values.
We will follow the first 3 chapters of Pollack's "Not always buried
deep", as well as Chapter 6, and also Chapter 3 of Montgomery & Vaughan's
"Multiplicative number theory".  I recommend acquiring Pollack's
book, the second book is optional.

Prerequisites:  An undergrad number theory course, as well as some
abstract algebra.  I'll be happy to try and fill in gaps for motivated
students.

Grading:  There will be weekly written assignments, plus some class
presentations.  There will be no formal exams.  Enrolled graduate students
who have been admitted to candidacy will be excused from the written
assignments.

Homework due Wednesday, September 28:<br>
Ch. 1, numbers 3,4,5,8,9.  (If you see a problem you'd rather do, feel free to substitute.)<br>
Also this problem:  Let <i>a</i><sub>1</sub>=1 and if <i>a<sub>n</sub></i>
has already been defined, let 
<i>a</i><sub><i>n</i>+1</sub>=<i>a<sub>n</sub>...a</i><sub>1</sub>+1.  Prove that <i>a<sub>n</sub></i><2<sup>2<sup><i>n</i>-1</sup></sup>
for all <i>n</i>.  Use this to show that &#960;(<i>x</i>)&ge;loglog<i>x</i>
for all <i>x</i>&gt;1.
</p>		
<p> Here's a comment about Exercise 3.  It is unexpectedly difficult and
the referenced paper only proves a weaker result: Either <i>n</i>!+<i>k</i>
has a prime factor larger than <i>n</i> or it is a power of <i>k</i>
and <i>k</i> is prime.  One then deduces the same, namely that among
the <i>n</i> numbers <i>n</i>!+<i>k</i> for <i>k</i> running from 1 to
<i>n</i>, there are at least <i>n</i> distinct primes dividing them.
</p><p>
The exercise as stated is true and it appears in a more difficult paper
from 1979.  I have worked out a proof of the original exercise along
different lines and perhaps we can discuss it later in the term.  For
now, you are permitted to substitute the easier version discussed above.
</p>

<p> Homework due Wednesday, October 5, 2011:<br>
Try to do problems 13 and 22 in the book.<br>
Use a computer to count the number of positive integers <i>n</i> with <i>n</i> prime
and <i>n</i> at most 10<i><sup>k</sup></i> for <i>k</i>=2, 3, 4, and 5.  Then do the
same but instead of <i>n</i> being prime, count <i>n</i> if <i>n</i><sup>2</sup>+1
is prime.  Then, the same for <i>n</i><sup>2</sup>+2.  And then for <i>n</i><sup>2</sup>+<i>n</i>+41.
<br>
Give another proof of Lemma 1.17 using smooth numbers.

<p>Homework due Wednesday, October 19:<br>
<b><a href="hw101911.pdf">Homework problems</a></b>
</p>

<p>Homework due Wednesday, November 2:<br>
(1) Ch. 3, #1.<br>
(2) Using the Taylor series for e<sup>n</sup>, show that e<sup>n</sup> > n<sup>n</sup>/n!.<br>
(3) Ch. 3, #3.  You can use problem 2 and also the second theorem of Mertens.<br>
(4) Using results from this chapter, prove that the sum of 1/(p log p) as p runs over primes
is convergent, but the sum of 1/(p loglog p) is divergent.<br>
(5) Use the prime number theorem to show that there are infinitely many primes whose decimal
representation start with the digits 123456789.  (The first one is 1234567891.)<br>
(6) Using the principle of partial summation, discussed in class, show that &pi;(x) ~ x/log x
as x tends to infinity if and only if &theta;(x) ~ x as x tends to infinity.

			<p style="text-align : justify"> Collaboration on
homework is definitely allowed and even encouraged.  However,
it is tempting to think that you understand something that was figured out
by your friend.  When you hand in a solution, you should know it well enough
that you could explain it to others.  Please name others you worked with
when handing in homework papers.              Merely copying (electronic or
			otherwise) of another person's solutions, in whole
			or in part, is a violation of the Honor Code.</p>
