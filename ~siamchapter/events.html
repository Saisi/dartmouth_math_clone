<h2 align = "left"> 14th Oct. 2013 <br> 6:00pm-7:00pm, Kemeny 004 </h2>
<h3 align = "left"> John Cain (Harvard University): <i> Chaos Control and Cardiac Arrhythmia </i> </h3>
<p> When a truck load of chickens collides with a truck load of molasses on a busy interstate, the result is chaos.  But how would applied mathematicians define "chaos" in a more rigorous sense?  Where might chaotic systems be observed in nature?  In particular, what would happen if the electrical wave patterns in the heart become "chaotic"?  In this presentation, I'll partially answer these questions.  I'll give an example of an abnormal cardiac rhythm that can degrade into a "chaotic" rhythm that can be fatal within minutes.  Then, I'll discuss some of the basic mathematics behind how that rhythm could be controlled using a medical device.  I'll keep the mathematical content of this talk at a level accessible to undergraduates.</p>

<h2 align = "left"> 2 Oct. 2013 <br> 12:00pm-1:30pm, Kemeny 201 </h2>
<h3 align = "left"> Bill Taber (Jet Propulsion Laboratory): <i> Informal Lunch </i> </h3>
<p> Drop by anytime to have Boloco and chat with Bill about anything mathematical.</p>

<h2 align = "left"> 15 May 2013 <br> 6pm, Haldeman 041 </h2>
<h3 align = "left"> Maeve McCarthy (Murray State University): <i> Optimal control of insects through sterile insect release and habitat modification </i> </h3>
<p> This talk develops an ordinary differential equation model to
investigate the introduction of sterile mosquitoes to reduce the
incidence of mosquito-borne diseases. We will establish nonnegativity of
solutions which is essential biologically. Our goal is to minimize the
insect population while minimizing environmental impact and the cost of
sterile insect release. We do this using optimal control. We'll discuss
optimality conditions and some numerical simulations.</p>

<h2 align = "left"> 2 May 2013 <br> 6pm, Kemeny 004 </h2>
<h3 align = "left"> Lorenzo Torresani (Dartmouth): <i> Visual Recognition and Search in Gigantic Image Collections </i> </h3>
<p> The last few years have seen a tremendous explosion of image and video data on the Web. Unfortunately only a small portion of this visual data is annotated with text. Even when tags are available, they are often not accurate, rendering traditional text-search ineffective. In this talk I will describe my recent work on designing visual recognition systems that can help users browse and search image repositories more effectively. Our approach centers around the learning of a compact image descriptor optimized to yield accurate visual recognition with linear classifiers, enabling real- time visual search in millions of images. I will also discuss how our image descriptor can be used to extract useful semantic content from pictures appearing in Web pages in order to boost the accuracy of keyword-based document search engines. </p>


<h2 align = "left"> 24 Jan. 2013 <br> 6pm, Carson 060 </h2>
<h3 align = "left"> Adrianna Gillman (Dartmouth): <i> Graduate School Applications: The things you want to know and more. </i> </h3>
<p> Where should I apply? What test should do I have to take? When
should I take them? What are schools looking for in grad-uate students?
These are just some of the ques-tions that you will ask yourself when
applying to a mathematics graduate program. In this talk, we will answer
these questions and discuss what to expect after application has been
handed in. There will be plenty of time to answer additional questions.</p>

<h2 align = "left"> 8 Nov. 2012 <br> 6pm, Carson L02 </h2>
<h3 align = "left"> Sravana Reddy (Neukom Fellow): <i> What do we know about the Voynich Manuscript? </i> </h3>
<p> In 1912, a book collector named Wilfrid Voynich acquired a curious object from Europe: a 240-page, lavishly illustrated folio in an unknown script. Attempts to decipher the text have all hit a dead-end, with the jury out on which (if any) language it represents, or if it's a code or gibberish. The availability of statistical tools and ideas from machine learning opens up new ways of approaching this problem. I will talk about methods to infer simple linguistic patterns from a given text -- can we tell if a script denotes vowels and consonants? or if pages have "topics"? -- and what that might tell us about the Voynich Manuscript. Along the way, I will also introduce some commonly used machinery and algorithms in computational linguistics, and their applicability to other tasks.</p>

<h2 align = "left"> 18 Oct. 2012 <br> 6pm, Moore B03   </h2>
<h3 align = "left"> Olivia Prosper (Dartmouth): <i> Modeling Malaria </i> </h3>
<p> Despite many efforts to reduce the burden of malaria, this vector-borne disease continues to endanger millions around the globe each year.  Mathematical modeling can play an important role in evaluating why some control efforts have been unsuccessful and inform future decisions regarding malaria control.  In this talk, I will give a brief introduction to modeling infectious diseases with simple mathematical models, then I will highlight different projects I have been involved in to illustrate how we can extend  and use these models to address problems relevant to malaria dynamics and control.<p>

<h2 align = "left"> 21 May 2012 <br> 6pm, Haldeman 041</h2>
<h3 align = "left"> Franklyn J. Kelecy (ANSYS Inc): <i> Computational Fluid Dynamics: History, Methods, and Modern
Applications.</i> </h3>
<p> Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can be defined as the science of
solving the equations which govern fluid flow, heat and mass transfer, and
related physical phenomena using numerical techniques.  Sophisticated CFD
software packages have been developed over many years to provide efficient,
robust, and accurate numerical solutions for a wide range of fluid flow
problems.  Applications are numerous and ubiquitous in science and
engineering, and include numerical weather prediction, biomedical flows,
the prediction of lift and drag on automobiles and aircraft, and simulation
of industrial equipment performance, from combustors and turbines in jet
engines to internal flow systems in chemical processing and manufacturing.
In all cases, the principal goal of CFD is to gain a better understanding
the flow physics which, in many cases, can not be fully determined using
experimental observations and measurement techniques.  </p>

<h2 align = "left"> 30 Apr. 2012 <br> 6pm, Kemeny 006</h2>
<h3 align = "left"> Steven Peterson (Thayer): <i>Adventures in System Dynamics:  The Youth Violence Systems Project </i></h3>
<p>Since its initial development in the 1950s, system dynamics has been applied to a wide range of problems across a broad set of content areas.  The approach has been used productively, for example, to address issues associated with energy policy, defense logistics, community development, ecosystem resilience, and business strategy and tactics.  The approach draws applies concepts of accumulation, flow, and information feedback to provide a visual language for representing and simulating dynamic processes.</p>

<p>In this session, the speaker will provide a brief overview of the essential components of the system dynamics approach.  Then, the speaker will illustrate one application of the approach using the Youth Violence Systems Project as a case study. This ongoing project, based in Boston, is using system dynamics as a focal point of a community-based process aimed at improving community understanding of the causes of violence among youth, and at helping communities to develop strategies for achieving sustained reduction in violence. </p>

<h3 align = "left"> Chris Danforth (UVM): <i>Measuring Happiness: Social Media as a Laboratory</i></h3>
<p> Using human evaluation of the happiness of words, we analyze a diverse set of large-scale texts which reflect human experience including millions of weblogs and billions of status updates from Twitter. We find that happiness rises and falls with age and distance from the Earth's equator; the 2008 Presidential Election was the happiest day in the blogosphere in the last 5 years; and the written form of the English language exhibits a pro-social bias.  In this talk, we discuss these findings in the context of our ongoing effort to develop a remote sensor of population level well-being: the 'Hedonometer'.</p>
