<h1> Dartmouth SIAM </h1> 
<P align="right"> <a href = "index.html">Home</a> </P>

<p> <h2> Who We Are </h2>
<p> Established in Winter of 2012, the Dartmouth SIAM chapter was created to make students aware of possible career paths in industrial and applied mathematics, enable students to use their skills and creativity to complete projects and compete in competitions, and provide a forum for students to share their thoughts and ideas with respect to industrial and applied mathematics. We are an organization open to all interested students, with no membership dues or fees. <br> <br>
<p>While involved, students will enjoy the benefits of our chapter, which includes but is not limited to, talks by distinguished speakers, field trips and mathematical competitions, as well as benefits of the national organization, such as research opportunities, networking, and further career and academic resources. Meetings and/or lectures from distinguished mathematicians will be held at least once a month, with other events such as mathematical modeling workshops, modeling competitions,  and field trips that expose students to careers in industrial and applied mathematics planned by the chapter. See the <a href = "events.html">Events</a> page for upcoming events.
