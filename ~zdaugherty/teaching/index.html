<h2>Previous experience</h2>

<b>St Olaf College</b><p>
I was a visiting assistant professor at <a href="http://moodle.stolaf.edu/">St. Olaf College</a> fall 2010 and spring 2011. There, I taught one section of Calculus 1, four sections of Calculus 2, and one section of Differential Equations. All course information was available to enrolled students on <a href="http://moodle.stolaf.edu/">Moodle</a>, but summaries of course content are available here:<p>
<ol>
<a href="javascript:;" onClick="ShowHideLayer('StOCalculus1');">Calculus 1</a>
<div id="StOCalculus1" style="display: none;"><font size=2>This course introduces differential and integral calculus of functions of a single real variable, including trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. Derivatives and integrals are explored graphically, symbolically, and numerically. Applications of the derivative are included. Prerequisite: mathematics placement recommendation.

<a href="javascript:;" onClick="ShowHideLayer('StODiffEq');">Differential Equations</a>
<div id="StODiffEq" style="display: none;"><font size=2>This course introduces differential equations and analytical, numerical, and graphical techniques for the analysis of their solutions. First- and second-order differential equations and linear systems are studied. Applications are selected from areas such as biology, chemistry, economics, ecology, and physics. Laplace transforms or nonlinear systems may be covered as time permits. Students use computers extensively to calculate and visualize results. Prerequisite: Calculus 2 and Linear Algebra.

<b>University of Wisconsin - Madison</b><p>
My position as a teaching assistant at the <a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu">
University of Wisconsin</a> began upon my entry as a graduate student in the 
Fall of 2005. Spring 2006 and 2009, I was supported by the VIGRE grant, and in spring 2008 I was studying at <a href="http://www.msri.org/">MSRI</a>, and so was without teaching responsibilities.<p><p>

Sections taught as a teaching assistant:
<ul>
Spring 2010: Finite Math (Math 222). Lecturer: <a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~terwilli/">
Paul Terwilliger</a><br>
Fall 2009: Calculus & Analytic Geometry II (Math 222), <b>Coordinator</b>. Lecturer: <a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~seeger/">
Andreas Seeger</a><br>
Fall 2008: Calculus & Analytic Geometry II (Math 222), 
 <a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~wes/">WES instructor</a>. Lecturer: <a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~nagel/">
 Alex Nagel</a>, [<a href="evals/fall_2008.pdf">Sample Evaluations</a>]<br>
Fall 2007: Calculus & Analytic Geometry (Math 221), 
 <b>Coordinator</b>. Lecturer: 
 Sigurd Angenent</a>, [<a href="evals/fall_2007.pdf">Sample Evaluations</a>]<br>
Summer 2007: Calculus (Math 211). 
Lecturer: <a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~%20malekpou/">Shirin Malekpour</a><br>
Spring 2007: Linear Algebra & Differential Equations (Math 320). 
Lecturer: <a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~shterenb/">Roman Shterenberg</a>, [<a href="evals/spring_2007.pdf">Sample Evaluations</a>]<br>
Fall 2006: Calculus & Analytic Geometry (Math 221), 
 <b>Coordinator</b>. Lecturer: <a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~ram/">
 Arun Ram</a>, [<a href="evals/fall_2006.pdf">Sample Evaluations</a>]<br>
Fall 2005: Calculus & Analytic Geometry
(Math 221). Lecturer: <a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~peters/">Han Peters</a>, 
[<a href="evals/fall_2005.pdf">Sample Evaluations</a>]

</ul>

I also participated in a year-long seminar (2005-2006, run by 
<a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~wilson/">Bob Wilson</a>) in which I 
helped to revise the training program for new Teaching Assistants. Later, I continued to help design and edit the <a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~daughert/TAsite/">Resources for Mathematics Teaching Assistants</a> site which had its start in this seminar. 
<p>


My tutoring and mentoring experience includes working for the <a href="http://www.hmc.edu/acad/Learning/">Academic Excellence Program</a>, 
a special program designed to help students learn more by teaching them to 
work together. Tutors for this program attended weekly 
training meetings at which we discussed creative ways to teach and facilitate 
problem solving. We also ran exam review sessions and designed special 
workshops for study skills and writing style. 
Together with Tim Carnes and 
<a href="http://www.ericmalm.net/work/">Eric Malm</a>, 
I prepared a version of this <a href="writing_tips.pdf">Writing Tips</a> 
handout.
<p>

I also worked at one of the University of Wisconsin's special 
tutoring programs in Fall 2006. 
The <a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~tprogram/">Mathematics Tutorial 
Program</a> offers free tutoring in a cooperative learning environment for 
students enrolled in introductory math classes. Along with a tutor, students 
predominantly spend the time working practice problems at the board. The focus 
is on student work and presentation, guided by tutors and worksheets.<p>

Finally, in Fall 2007 and 2008, I served as a mentor for the UW Mentorship program for women in Math and Science, a mentorship program connecting talented highschool girls to Math graduate students.<p>



<!--<h2>Tutoring</h2>


I began tutoring mathematics in the Fall of 2000. 
My experience includes high school and college level coursework, and standard examination prep. 
At the high school level, I have privately tutored everything from Pre-Algebra 
to AP Calculus.<p>

At the college level, I have privately tutored many courses, including 
College Algebra, Finite Mathematics, Calculus (Business, Single Variable, 
and Multi-Variable), Linear Algebra, and Abstract Algebra. In addition, 
during my time as an undergraduate at 
<a href="http://www.hmc.edu">Harvey Mudd College</a>, I worked directly 
for the <a href="http://www.math.hmc.edu">math department</a> and the 
<a href="http://www.hmc.edu/acad/Learning/">learning program</a>. 
My experience there is as follows:
<ul>
<li>Tutor and Head Grader -- Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and 
Probability and Statistics -- Summer 2002. <br>
<li>Tutor and Head Grader -- Multivariable Calculus and 
Probability & Statistics -- Fall 2002. <br>
<li>Tutor -- Linear Algebra and Differential Equations -- Summer 2003.<br>
<li>Tutor -- Abstract Algebra -- Fall 2003.<br>
<li>Academic Excellence Tutor (Harvey Mudd College) -- Core Math (Single and Multi-Variable 
Calculus, Probability and Statistics, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, 
and Discrete Mathematics) -- Spring 2003 to Spring 2005.
