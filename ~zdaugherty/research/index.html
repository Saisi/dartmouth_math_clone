I work mainly in combinatorial representation theory. Specifically, I study how combinatorial objects (like partitions, tableaux, lattices, etc.) encode structure of algebras similar to the group algebra of the symmetric group, Brauer algebras, graded and affine Temperley-Lieb, Hecke, and Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebras, etc.. My thesis work, completed in 2010 at the University of Wisconsin--Madison, began the study of two-boundary Hecke algebras.<p>

The commutator relationships provide amazing tools for transferring representation theoretic information back and forth, and reveal beautiful combinatorial structure. In this talk, I will define the quasi-partition algebra, which arises as a centralizer algebra for the symmetric group.

Abstract: Several diagram algebras (like group algebras of symmetric groups or braid groups) arise as endomorphisms of tensor spaces that commute with classical Lie groups, Lie algebras, quantum groups, etc.. The commutator relationships provide amazing representation theoretic tools, and reveal beautiful combinatorial structure. In this talk I will describe how the affine type C Hecke algebra H arises as a diagram algebra. I will describe three ways of encoding irreducible representations of H--two classifications coming from the internal structure of the algebra (involving hyperplane and box arrangements) and one arrising from its cetralizer relationships (involving partitions and tableaux)--and show how to move between these encodings.

Abstract: Irreducible representations for the affine Hecke algebras of type C can be encoded combinatorially in a few different ways:
as points and regions in affine space relative to certain hyperplane arrangements, as arrangements and fillings of boxes with certain rotational symmetries, and now as certain partitions and tableaux arising from the representations of the complex Lie algebra gln. In this talk I will describe these three combinatorial models and the correspondence between
them.

Abstract: Representation theory is the study of abstract algebraic structures (e.g. groups) by representing them as sets of linear maps that obey the same addition and multiplication rules. By understanding the representations of a group, you can better understand the group itself, without having to deal with everything at once. Combinatorial representation theory (CRT) uses combinatorial tools (like partitions, tableaux, graphs, etc) to encode and keep track of the representation theory for many many wonderful groups, rings, algebras, etc.. We'll take a brief look at the poster child of CRT, the symmetric group, and see some examples of how combinatorics can be a powerful tool in studying algebraic objects.

The commutator relationships provide amazing tools for studying the algebras' representation theory, and reveal beautiful combinatorial structure. This work
provides a bridge between results in quantum physics (and the two-boundary Temperley-Lieb algebra), the representation theory of the affne Hecke algebra of type C, and the combinatorics developed in thesis work on the degenerate two- boundary Hecke algebra, establishing a transfer of useful information between theses different points of view.This work is joint with Arun Ram. </font></ol></div> <p>

Abstract: The partition algebra arises as a centralizer algebra for the symmetric group acting on the k-fold tensor product of its permutation representation. It also has a diagrammatic description, generated by set partitions of 2k elements (thus the name). The permutation representation is not in general irreducible, though. In this talk, I will define a new related algebra, the quasi-partition algebra, which also arises as a centralizer algebra for the symmetric group, but now acting on the k-fold tensor product of the large irreducible submodule of the permutation representation. A similar diagrammatic description and some wonderful combinatorial results will be given. This work is joint with Rosa Orellana. </font></ol></div> <p>

Abstract: The affine Birman-Murakami-Wenzl (BMW) algebra arises are both as a algebra of tangles in a space with one puncture and as the centralizer of orthogonal and symplectic quantum groups on a certain tensor space of modules. The definition of the affine BMW algebra (and its degenerate version) relies on a choice of an infinite family of parameters, though this choice is not free; admissibility conditions have been studied at length. However, when viewing this algebra within the context of its action on tensor space, a family of central elements within the quantum group present themselves as a very natural choice of parameters. These central elements also arise in the study of higher Casimir invariants, and satisfy many beautiful recursion relations. I will outline how these elements arise in the study of centralizer algebras and how they fit into the larger study of both BMW algebras and Lie algebras and quantum groups. (Joint work with Arun Ram and Rahbar Virk.)</font></ol></div> <p>

		<div id="2012.03.29" style="display: none;"><ol><font size=2>
Abstract: Around the turn of the 20th century, there was a wonderful breakthrough in studying infinite groups and their group-algebras: Schur-Weyl duality began as a transfer of information from the symmetric group to the general linear group via commuting actions on a very natural vector space. Since then, there has been an explosion of developments in tensor power centralizer algebras: algebras rising in duality with more familiar groups and algebras. Examples include the Brauer algebras, braid groups and quotients thereof, and tangle algebras. Sometimes we are so lucky as to discover that objects of outside interest also arise in duality with familiar algebras.<p>

We'll take a brief tour of algebras arising as tensor power centralizer algebras, all of which will be generated by diagrams (like permutation diagrams, braids, tangles, etc.). Then we'll see how an algebra previously arising out of studies of reflection groups, a priori unrelated to centralizer algebras, is in fact a centralizer algebra itself. This is joint work with Arun Ram.  </font></ol></div> <p>

		<div id="2011.04.09" style="display: none;"><ol><font size=2>Abstract:
The degenerate affine BMW algebra $W_k$ was introduced by Nazarov (there called the affine Wenzl algebra) in his study of the Brauer algebras via Jucys-Murphy elements. It arises in Schur-Weyl duality with the orthogonal and symplectic Lie algebras in the same way that the graded Hecke algebra of type A is in Schur-Weyl duality with the Lie algebras $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_n$. We will introduce the degenerate affine braid group, which has both the degenerate affine BMW algebra and the graded Hecke algebra as quotients. We will explore how results arise for $W_k$ which parallel those for the graded Hecke algebra. </font></ol></div> <p>

		<div id="2011.04.15" style="display: none;"><ol><font size=2>Abstract:
The "affine BMW algebra" developed out of a search for knot and link invariants. However, studying this algebra involves a lot more combinatorics than it does topology. In fact, most of the tools one needs to build its representations were developed for the purposes of understanding the symmetric group and its direct descendants. We'll pick a couple of these symmetric-group-like algebras, build some modules using partitions and Young tableaux, and use these big families of modules to deduce some structure about the algebras themselves.  </font></ol></div> <p>

The affine Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebra arises both diagrammatically as an algebra of tangles in a punctured space, and algebraically via Schur-Weyl duality with the action of quantum groups of classical Lie type. Through exploring the structure of the affine BMW algebra and its degenerate version, we reveal that the center each algebra is generated by a nice family of symmetric functions. In particular the center of the degenerate affine BMW algebra is a ring that also arises in studying, for example, pro jective representation theory of the symmetric group, Chern numbers of kernel and cokernel bundles, and the homology of the loop space of the symplectic group.</font></ol></div><p>

 	<ol><font size=2>Abstract: We study families of algebras that arise as algebras of commuting operators for the action of a finite dimensional complex reductive Lie algebra on a tensor space of the form $M \otimes N \otimes V^{\otimes k}$. This work uses similar techniques employed in the study of graded Hecke and Brauer algebras as centralizer algebras to construct two boundary analogs. In this talk, we outline this construction and explore some of the elegant combinatorial properties of the representation theory of specific examples.</font></ol></div>

	<ol><font size=2>Abstract: Two boundary diagram algebras (e.g. graded braid groups, Hecke algebras, Brauer algebras) arise as tensor power centralizer algebras, algebras of commuting operators for a Lie algebra action on a tensor space.

As an example, we study in detail the combinatorics of special cases corresponding to gl_n and sl_n.</font></ol></div><p>

		Abstract: There are many great examples of algebras which arise as tensor power centralizer algebras, algebras of operators which preserve symmetries in a tensor space. The most familiar example is the connection between the general linear group and the symmetric group, studied by Frobenius and Schur around 1900. The key is that these mutually centralizing algebras have linked representation theory, so the combinatorial tools used to study one algebra can be harnessed to study the other. In this talk, I will introduce some of these combinatorial tools, and talk about how to apply them to the representation theory of many favorite examples of diagram algebras.</div>

	<ol><font size=2>Abstract: Two boundary diagram algebras (e.g. graded braid groups, Hecke algebras, Brauer algebras) arise as tensor power centralizer algebras, algebras of commuting operators for a Lie group action on a tensor space, and show ties to already familiar objects. In particular, one two boundary centralizer algebra in type A is isomorphic to a graded Hecke algebra for a reflection group of type C. In this talk, I will construct this algebra, discuss its representations and their combinatorial structure, and provide its relation to type C objects.

	<ol><font size=2>Abstract: The graded Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebra arises as a tensor power centralizer algebra, an algebra of operators which preserve symmetries in a tensor space. The classical case, studied by Frobenius and Schur around 1900, provided the link between the representation theory of the symmetric group and the general linear group. In this talk, I will utilize combinatorial tools to explore the link between the actions of the graded BMW algebra and the symplectic and orthogonal Lie algebras on the tensor space.

		<ol><font size=2>Abstract: In voting theory, simple questions can lead to convoluted and sometimes paradoxical results. Recently, mathematician Donald Saari used geometric insights to study various voting schemes. He argued that a particular positional voting  scheme (namely that proposed by Borda gives rise to the fewest paradoxes. In this talk, I presented an approach to similar ideas that draw from group theory and algebra. In particular, I employed tools from representation theory to elicit some of the natural behaviors of voting profiles. I also made generalizations to similar results for partially ranked data.</font></ol></div></font>
