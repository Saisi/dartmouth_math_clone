<ul><li> The final exam will be on Sunday, August 28 from 3:00 to 6:00 in Room 007 Kemeny Hall. You are responsible for the entire terms work, but the emphasis will be on the material since the last exam. You may bring into the exam a 3 x 5 index card with anything of your choosing written on one side. The exam consists of nine problems - one is true/false (see below) and one short answers (but not definitions). Two of the problems call for proofs. Furthermore there will be a Q & A session on Friday at 4:00 in Room 006 Kemeny (our classroom).
</ul></li>


<ul><li> There will be one problem on the final exam which consists of 15 true/false questions. At the end of nearly all the sections in our textbook, there are two problems each of which consists of several true/false questions. For the final exam true/false problem, one true/false question was chosen from each of the following assigned sections: sections 1.8 - 6.2 except for sections 3.1, 3.2, 4.4 and 5.4.

</p>

<ul>
  <li> On Exams: No help given or received. No calculators are to be used. <br></li>
</ul>

<ul>  
<li>On Homework: Students are encouraged to work together with one or two classmates and/or to seek help from the instructor. Those students who do not know of anyone to work with but would like to collaborate should contact the instructor.  Students should state on their homework paper the names of those with whom they have collaborated. What is important in doing homework is the eventual comprehension of the solution of the problem. 
When a student writes up a homework problem it is to be his or her own understanding of how to solve the problem. The solutions that a student submits must be written by him or her alone. Any copying of another person's solutions, in whole or in part, will be regarded as a violation of the Honor Code.</i> <br></li>
