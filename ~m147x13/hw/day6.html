<h1>Homework due day 6</h1>

<p>
Produce a detailed overall plan for the first math camp. You do not
need to have lesson plans, but the entire structure should be planned
in detail. What is the schedule? What topics are taught when? Who
is responsible for teaching? What will other people be doing during
that time? Who is responsible for other things? What materials are
needed? Who will obtain them, and when? Are there breaks, and if so,
what happens during them? What is your overall plan for evaluation,
and how is it scheduled and implemented on a day-to-day basis?

<p>
We require three things of you:
<ol>
<li>First, each of you must have an equitable share of teaching respon-
sibilities and opportunities. When it comes to teaching, this means a
fair distribution of time, but it also means that everyone has a chance
to try different techniques; you may not have the best lecturers, or the
least nervous ones, do all the speaking.
<li>Second, at all times one of you must be an observer. Since we may
ask the observer to look for particular things, if you want specific ob-
servations done as part of your evaluation plan, somebody else should
be doing that.
<li>Third, somebody must be available to talk to parents as they drop
students off.
</ol>
Beyond that, it's up to you how you do things. Sometimes graduate
students have been individually responsible for given chunks of lesson
plan; sometimes they've worked as pairs to produce plans. You can
talk to Amy or Tracy about money for snacks, materials, and so forth.
