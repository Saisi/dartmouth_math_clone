<h1>Homework due day 2</h1>

<p>
(1) As a group, come up with a list of seven or eight goals for the
first high school math camp. As in our exercise today, these goals
should be focused on student knowledge, capabilities, behaviors, and
beliefs.  ("Students will do...," not, "Students will be exposed
to...") and be such that progress can be evaluated by measures (not
necessarily quantitative) of student behavior. Since you have not yet
chosen a topic for the camp, they will not be content-specific
goals. Please don't include something like "they will learn the
material." You will have a chance to determine content specific goals
later.

<p>
(2) Prepare a five-minute presentation for the class about some topic
connected with your thesis research. You will give this presentation
tomorrow, and we will videotape it. At the end of the course, you will
give another five-minute presentation, and will be able to compare them,
and to include this record of progress in your portfolio. You may, of
course, use the blackboard for your presentation; for this exercise, do
not use the computer. You do not have to talk about your actual thesis
question. Choose a topic appropriate for this audience. Be sure to limit
your presentation to five minutes, as we will stop recording at that
point. (Suggestion: Plan for four minutes.)
