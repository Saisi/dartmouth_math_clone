<h1>Homework due day 8</h1>

<p>
(1) Individually each prepare a 5-minute lecture segment of a lesson
plan from math camp 1, to be delivered at the start of Wednesday's
class and videoed. Explicitly make use of techniques from the Hativa
(1983) article; this requires reading Hativa. Also hand in to us your
(mini) lesson plan with annotations (which can be by hand) showing use
where the categories of good techniques from Hativa you are using
appear in your lesson. Use reference numbers from Table 1 of Hativa
(eg, 1.23). Also tell us one goal from your first video feedback essay
that you are working on in this presentation.

<p>
(2) Revise the lesson plans for days 1 and 2 of math camp, in light
of whatever we said in class needs to be added.
