<h1>Homework due day 3</h1>

<p>

1) Zull
<p>
Be ready to explain and comment on one or two important ideas from the
chapter of Zull we assigned you in Friday's class.  If you are one of
the people who read the whole book, then also be ready to explain and
comment on one or two important ideas from the remainder of the
book (ie not the chapters 2,3,4,6,11,12 which everyone read).


<p>
2) Evaluation of one MC1 goal: 
<p>
Design an evaluation plan for one math camp goal. (Each of you will be
assigned one of the goals on your list.) Include both qualitative and
quantitative (numerical) evaluation measures. Please be detailed on how you
will obtain data, and how you will evaluate that data. For instance, if you
plan to count the number of comments/questions: What indicates success? A
given number? A given rate? An increase over time? If you ask a question:
How will you ask it? (In class? To each student individually? In writing?)
What answers will indicate success?
<p>
Submit your plan in writing before the beginning of Monday's class.

<p>
3) Individual response to 5-min videos (due Tuesday, day 4):
<p>
Watch your taped sample presentation (this can be painful or embarrasing for
any of us; you may find it helpful to schedule in instructor or classmate to
watch it with you). Write an analysis (about 1.5 pages), including what you
were trying to accomplish (your goals for the presentation), how well you
think you did, and what you learned from the audience and instructor
responses and from watching the tape. Conclude by discussing specifically
how you hope to further develop or improve as a lecturer in the near future.
Include time-codes (eg 04:20 - 04:30) from your video for at least two
examples to illustrate your analysis.
<p>
Include as an appendix the actual audience response forms, as we don't
have copies.
