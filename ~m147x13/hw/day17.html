<h1>Homework due day 17</h1>

<p>
Tomorrow (Thurs, 1pm, in Kemeny 200, not downstairs)
you'll be giving a 5-minute presentation on something connected to your
research, in a similar fashion as at the beginning of the seminar. As
before, it should be aimed at the other Math 147 participants. This includes
the context that we have seen your first research talk, but also that that
was 6 weeks ago and hence won't remember it very well at all! If you want to
stick to the same research question, or to tell us about another different
question, both are fine. Have fun with it. As before, they will be videoed.

<p>Also, bring at least two questions each that you have about teaching next
year for the faculty, 2:40-4pm.
