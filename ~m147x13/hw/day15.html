<h1>Homework due day 15</h1>

<ol>
<li>
read Krantz 4.10

<li>Use the web to read a bunch of teaching statements in mathematics (or, for
Shahrzad, in computer science). Print out one or two that are your favorites
and be able to explain what you like about them. Although you will probably
end up reading about some good or interesting teaching practices or styles,
try to focus on what makes the statement itself good (i.e. apart from the
practices it describes).
</ol>

<p>Early warning: due on Thurs will be another 5-minute presentation on
something connected to your research, aimed at the other M147 participants,
in the same style as at the beginning of this course. We will once again
videotape them.
