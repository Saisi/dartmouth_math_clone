<h1>Homework due day 5</h1>

<p>
1) As a group, choose a topic for the first math camp.

<p>
2) Individually, complete the lesson plan for a cooperative learning
experience you were working on in class. Include all the details.
If you will address the class as a whole, what will you say? If
you will write anything on the board, exactly what? If you will
use worksheets, prepare them and include them in your lesson
plan. How much time will each portion of the activity take? If
this activity does not take an entire class period, say (in a brief
sentence) what happens before and/or after.

<p>
Ensure that you leave lots of margin or vertical space (for
possible additions on Wednesday's class), and
bring a print-out or photocopy to class.                   

<p>
3) Skemp
<p>
Be ready to explain and comment on one or two important ideas from the
chapter of Skemp we assigned you in Tuesday's class.
If you are one of
the people who read the whole book, then also be ready to explain and
comment on one or two important ideas from the remainder of the
book (ie not the chapters 2, 3, 8, 9, 13, which everyone read).
