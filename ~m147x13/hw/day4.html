<h1>Homework due day 4</h1>

<p>

1) Duckworth
<p>
Be ready to explain and comment on one or two important ideas from the
chapter of Duckworth (or intro to Piaget) we assigned you in Monday's class.
If you are one of
the people who read the whole book, then also be ready to explain and
comment on one or two important ideas from the remainder of the
book (ie not the chapters Intro, 2, 4, 5, 11 which everyone read).

<p>
3) Individual response to 5-min videos:
<p>
Watch your taped sample presentation (this can be painful or embarrasing for
any of us; you may find it helpful to schedule in instructor or classmate to
watch it with you). Write an analysis (about 1.5 pages), including what you
were trying to accomplish (your goals for the presentation), how well you
think you did, and what you learned from the audience and instructor
responses and from watching the tape. Conclude by discussing specifically
how you hope to further develop or improve as a lecturer in the near future.
Include time-codes (eg 04:20 - 04:30) from your video for at least two
examples to illustrate your analysis.
<p>
Include as an appendix the actual audience response forms, as we don't
have copies.
