<h1>Homework due day 11</h1>

<p>
Overall plan for MC2, and evaluation plan.

<p>
Please choose your topics for each day, and who does what each day. You also
need to create your detailed evaluation plan for your overall goals and two
current mathematical content goals.  Think about formative as well as
summative, and formal as well as informal ways to evaluate.  You may not yet
know all of your detailed content goals, but include what kinds, format, and
timing of content evaluations you will do.  Your evaluation plan needs to be
of high enough quality to be put in a portfolio that you would exhibit to
demonstrate the quality of your teaching (for job applications, tenure,
grant application, etc).  This means that your summative evaluation plan
needs to be completely finalized by Sunday evening, so that your evaluation
is valid (if it changes once the camp is in progress, it is not valid!)

<p>
Early warning: we'll ask you to give a 5 min lecture from MC2 material
at the start of Thursday. The rest of this week's homework will be, as you
expect, lesson plans.
