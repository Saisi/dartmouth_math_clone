<h1>Homework due day 7</h1>

<p>
As a group, create complete lesson plans for the first two days of
math camp 1.  These must include for each lesson: goals, materials,
assessment plans (this means copies of the actual questionnaires
you'll use, and who will handle them, what observers will do and from
where in the room).  If you are one of the people who is lecturing
less in the first two days, we suggest that you contribute on assessment
plans, and checking prior knowledge   
needed for each lesson is already present.

You also may want to start reading the Hativa (1983) article on
clarity in lecturing.
