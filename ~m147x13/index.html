<center><h1>Math 147: Graduate Teaching Seminar</h1>
<p>
Summer 2013<br>
Kemeny 200, 1-4pm (apart from 12-5pm during math camps).
Instructors: <a href="../~groszek/index.html">Marcia Groszek</a> and
<a href="../~ahb/index.html">Alex Barnett</a>
<br>
Teaching assistant: <a href="../~jenniferharnish/index.html">Jenny Harnish</a>
</center>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<a href="m147goals.pdf">Here</a> are the course goals as a PDF file.

<h3>Readings</h3>

<p>
The readings (see <a href="hw/precourse.html">pre-course work</a>) will be:
<ul>
<li> James Zull, "The Art of Changing the Brain" (2002).
<li> Richard R. Skemp, "The Psychology of Learning Mathematics," expanded American edition (1987)
<li> Eleanor Duckworth, "The Having of Wonderful Ideas and Other Essays
on Teaching and Learning," 2nd edition (1996)
</ul>

For Duckworth you'll want to read a bit on Piaget before you start,
eg <a href="http://www.simplypsychology.org/piaget.html">here</a>.
Watching the videos of kids is fun too (lots more on youtube).

<h3>Required books to buy</h3>

<ul>
<li>Steven Krantz, "How to Teach Mathematics," 2nd edition (AMS, 1999).
<li>John Meier and Thomas Rishel, "Writing in the Teaching and Learning of Mathematics" (MAA, 1998).
<li>E. Rogers, N. Davidson, and B. Reynolds,
"Cooperative Learning in Undergraduate Mathematics: Issues and Strategies
That Work" (MAA, 2001). <i>Out of print and available as photocopy in binder - ask at the math office</i>
</ul>


<h3>Timeline and Assignments</h3>

The summer teaching course will be June 27 - August 16, with
no classes on July 4 or July 5.
Please block out 1-4pm each day in the regular course; some weeks we'll only use 4 of the 5 days.
High school math camp will be the weeks of July 15 through 19 and July 29
through August 2 (please block out noon-5pm all days these weeks).

<p>
The final week, August 12 through 16, will probably be devoted to guest
teaching and not include any class meetings, although this isn't guaranteed;
we may need to move some classes to work around the guest teaching schedules
of graduate students, or the schedules of our guest speakers.
