<B></CENTER>Abstract. </B>Though they appeared in the 1930's in the setting of algebraic
topology, coalgebras have remained at the fringe of the mathematical
world.  Recent applications in physics, combinatorics, and computer
science have prompted a review of the basic idea of a coalgebra.  It turns
out that far from being esoteric and abstract, coalgebras are very common
and natural. In fact, we have all worked with coalgebras since fourth
grade.<P>
