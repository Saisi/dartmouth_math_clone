speaks on <BR>
<H3>The Logic Engine Approach to Geometric Lower Bounds</H3>
<BR>
<B></CENTER>Abstract.</B>We present a simple mechanical computer, called a  _logic
engine_, which solves instances of the  Not-All-Equal 3-Satisfiability
problem.   Then we show how  this mechanical device can be used as a
powerful mental image to devise NP-hardness results for a variety of
geometric graph embedding problems. The talk will be self-contained.<BR>
All are welcome. <P>
