speaks on <BR>
<H3>What is Curvature?</H3>
<BR>
<B></CENTER>Abstract.</B>I will explain how various curvatures are defined and come up
naturally in many different contexts: Angle excess in triangles, The
Bochner technique, Conjugate points, holonomy and more. In each case I'll
attempt to explain how various curvature hypotheses lead to metric or
topological constraints. Corresponding to the above topics we have: The
Gauss-Bonnet theorem, bounds for Betti numbers, Myer's diameter bound,
and the classification of manifolds with non-negative curvature operator.<P>
