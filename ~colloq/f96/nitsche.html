<H3>Vortex Sheet motion and the formation of Vortex Rings</H3>
<BR>
<B></CENTER>Abstract.</B>A vortex sheet is a mathematical model for a  shear layer in
which the finitely thick layer is approximated by a surface. Ideally, the
solution to the model equations approximates the solution to the real
viscous flow equations in the limit of zero viscosity. I will first present
the numerical issues that arise in solving the model vortex sheet
equations, and then study applications to simulate a real viscous flow, the
formation of a vortex ring.<P>
