<H3>Re-Solving the Tension Between Plausible and
Demonstrative Reasoning in Mathematics</H3>
<BR>
<B></CENTER>Abstract.</B>Philosopher and mathematician Georg Polya argued that our
reliance on what he calls "demonstrative reasoning" (deductive reasoning)
in mathematics requires reliance on "plausible reasoning" (inductive<BR>
methods).  IN this paper I examine the various tasks that mathematicians
are required to do (e.g. finding problems to solve, deciding whether a
conjecture might be true, finding a proof of the conjecture, confirming
that the proof is correct).  I argue that, in addition to using plausible
reasoning to discover new mathematical conjectures, mathematicians
also use plausible reasoning to *justify* the correctness of their proofs. 
I then suggest ways of extending the use of plausible reasoning to include
inductive methods as equally legitimate as classical deductive proof
techniques.  <P>
