<center><h3>Statement and Proof of the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem</h3></center>
<b>Abstract.</b> The Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem has been at the center 
of a great deal of research in geometry, topology and operator
algebras. It is of current interest to physicists in computing
Seiberg-Witten invariants in topological quantum field theory. 
The Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem states that two integers associated
to an elliptic operator on a compact manifold, the "analytic index" and
the "topological index," are in fact the same. The analytic index measures
the difference in dimensions of the kernel and cokernel of the operator.
The topological index is computed using the symbol of the operator which
is given by local data and only depends on the highest order terms of the operator. 
In this talk, we will discuss low-dimensional examples
and give an elementary proof of Atiyah-Singer which illustrates that it
is a corollary of the Bott Periodicity phenomena in the K-theory
of  operator algebras. This talk will be accessible to a general mathematical 
audience.
