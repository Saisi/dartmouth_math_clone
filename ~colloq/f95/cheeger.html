<b>Abstract.</b> The curvedness of a Riemannian manifold is measured by
its curvature. In contrast to dimension two where there is only one
notion of curvature, the classical Gaussian curvature, in higher dimensions,
several notions are studied. Of current interest to both geometers and
physicists are Ricci curvature, which occurs in the Einstein field equation.
We will discuss the structure of manifolds whose Ricci curvature is
bounded from below. The kind of results we will discuss can be illustrated
from the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, from which it is easily seen that
if the Gaussian curvature is positive, then the surface has to be the
sphere. Therefore, conditions on curvature restrict the topology of manifolds. We will discuss higher dimensional analogue of this, and also
study the metric structure of such manifolds.
