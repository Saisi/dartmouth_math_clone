<center><h3>Using network flows for mesh generation</h3></center>
<b>Abstract.</b> Network flow techniques are applied to a problem arising in the computer 
aided design of cars, planes, ships or components of them: Refine a coarse 
mesh of spheric polygons that approximates the surface of a workpiece such 
that the resulting mesh is suitable for a numerical analysis (in 
particular, we are asked to achieve a specified mesh density and to 
generate meshes consisting of quadrilaterals only).
<p>
This turns out to be a difficult discrete problem (strongly NP-hard).  We 
show how to formulate it in terms of network flow theory.  We obtain a 
bidirected flow problem on an undirected graph G with upper and lower 
capacities on the edges and some additional node balance conditions.  The 
problem is then reduced to finding a feasible flow in that graph that 
satisfies all these constraints.  In our talk, we introduce a generic 
algorithm and discuss the encouraging results of a first implementation.  
<p>
The talk should be accessible to both graduate students and undergraduates; 
I will provide necessary background information.

This is joint work with Matthias Muller-Hannemann (Berlin) and Karsten 
Weihe (Konstanz).
