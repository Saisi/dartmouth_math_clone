<b>Abstract:</b>  
          Wiener's Generalized Harmonic Analysis is an old topic and wavelet
     theory is a new one. They both address problems in signal processing
     and turbulence, as well as other applications. Mathematically, they have
     common roots in Fourier analysis, including topics such as the classical
     uncertainty principle inequality and spectral estimation methods. This
     material is described, along with recent related results such as
     Bourgain's Phase Plane Theorem, and the quantitative definition of the
     Fourier transform for weighted spaces.
