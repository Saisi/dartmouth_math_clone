	TREE   LATTICES</h3></center>
<b>Abstract:</b>  The group $G$ of automorphisms of a locally finite
tree $X$ is a locally compact group, so one can consider lattices $L$
 in
$G$, i.e. discrete subgroups with quotient $G/L$ that is compact, or,
more generally, of finite invariant volume.  These are called also
$X$-lattices.  Natural examples arise in non archimedean Lie groups,
such as $H = SL(2,F)$, where $F$ is say a $p$-adic field.  There is a
natural ``Bruhat-Tits" tree $X$ on which $H$ operates, so  lattices in
$H$ will also be $X$-lattices.  The lecture discusses the theory of
general tree lattices, comparing it with the Lie group case.
