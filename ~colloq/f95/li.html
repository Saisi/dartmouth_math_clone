<center><h3>What Can Optimization Do for Image Restoration ?</h3></center>
<b>Abstract.</b> Many image restoration methods are formulated as minimizing a convex function with a quadratic equality constraint; different choices of the objective functions lead to different restoration methods. However, since a discrete image restoration problem is typically very large, existing computational algorithms rarely solve the minimization problem originally formulated.
<P>
We propose an iterative minimization algorithm for image restoration, using minimization of the total variation as the objective with an inequality quadratic constraint. In particular, we illustrate that different computational schemes for the same formulation can make significant difference in restoration quality.
<P>
Computational challenges of the proposed algorithm and the potential role of parallel computing will be discussed.
