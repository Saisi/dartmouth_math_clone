<center><h3>Interpolation in lattices</h3></center>
<b>Abstract.</b> A lattice is a partial order in which any two elements a,b have a
least upper bound a+b and a greatest lower bound a*b.  
Polynomials are defined as usual by applying these operations to
variables x,y, ... and constants a,b,... from the lattice, e.g. 
p(x) = ((x*b)+(c+x))*(d*a).   Functions which are described by a
polynomail are called polynomial functions. 

Similarly to the case of fields, polynomial functions  are of interest
because they can be easily computed.    Polynomial functions are
always monotone, so the question arises whether this property
characterizes polynomial functions.   Can it be that *all* monotone
functions are polynomial, or can  at least be approximated or
interpolated by polynomials? 

The answer is known for finite lattices.   We will discuss this
question mainly for infinite lattices.
