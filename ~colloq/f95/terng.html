<center><h3>Caustics and Submanifold Geometry</h3></center>
<b>Abstract.</b> The endpoint map of a submanifold $M$ in a complete Riemannian manifold $N$ is the restriction of the exponential map of $N$ to the normal bundle of
$M$, and the singularities of the end point map are called focal points or caustics. In this talk, I will explain the relation between the structure of caustics and the topology and geometry of $M$ and $N$.<p>
