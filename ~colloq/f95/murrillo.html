<center><h3>A historical overview of rational homotopy theory</h3></center>
<b>Abstract.</b> Ratonal homotopy theory can be thought of as the study of the torsion-free part of the homotopy groups of topological spaces. We present an outline of the historical development of this theory and give applications of this to other topics such as differential geometry and local algebra.
