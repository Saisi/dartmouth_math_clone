<B></CENTER>Abstract. </B>An important class of manifolds in Riemannian geometry are
those with positive curvature (or more generally nonnegative curvature).
In spite of much work on this subject, very few examples are known, all of
which are closely related to Lie groups and Lie group actions. We will
discuss known examples among homogeneous spaces, biquotients of Lie
groups, and cohomogeneity one manifolds.<P>
