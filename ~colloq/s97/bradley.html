<H3>Control and Stabilization of a Spherical Shell</H3>
<BR>
<BR>
<B></CENTER>Abstract. </B>In recent years, much work has been done to control and
stabilize flexible structures for deployment in space.  An example of such
a structure which may be modeled as a spherical shell is a satellite dish. 
We will discuss the issues of control (i.e. the ability to drive the shell
from one state to another) and  stabilization (i.e. the ability to damp out
vibrations exponentially). Techniques used include semigroup theory,
Sobolev space theory, multiplier techniques, unique continuation results
and much more! This talk is designed to be an introduction to both control
theory and nonlinear shells.<BR>
