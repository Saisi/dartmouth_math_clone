<B></CENTER>Abstract. </B>This talk will present an introduction to on-going research
on sums of Dirichlet series.  We will first survey some fundamental
ideas of Dirichlet which are closely related to his proof that there are
infinitely many primes in an arithmetic progression, next briefly
describe the analysis leading to the modern theory of automorphic
forms, and then fuse these topics to present some new objects whose
study has only begun.<BR>
