<B></CENTER>Abstract. </B>We describe how algebraically localizing homotopy and
homology groups of spaces led to "localizing" the spaces themselves.  This
is best understood as a localization of the homotopy category, but for this
we must be careful about what we mean by "the homotopy category".  The
best way to make this clear is by noticing that we're really doing
homotopy theory in a "model category", and that we're "localizing" the
model category structure.<P>
