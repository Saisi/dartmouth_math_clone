<H3>Duality for full crossed products of C*-algebras </H3>
<H3>by non-amenable groups</H3>
<BR>
<B></CENTER>Abstract. </B>The concept of duality in crossed products has attracted a good
deal of attention in the last few years, and I will give an overview of the
key ideas. This talk will begin with an introductory discussion about full
crossed products of C*-algebras at a level suitable for graduate students.<P>
I will then go on to discuss some of the results from my recently
completed PhD thesis. In particular, I will discuss the extent to which
induction and restriction of ideals in crossed products commute.<BR>
This work generalizes some of the results of Gootman and Lazar<BR>
to full crossed products by non-amenable groups. It leads to short, new
proofs of Katayama and Imai-Takai duality, the faithfulness of the induced
regular representation for full coactions and actions by amenable groups.<BR>
