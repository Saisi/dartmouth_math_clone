<H3>Sewing Ribbons on Graphs in Space</H3>
<BR>
<B></CENTER>Abstract.</B> A ribbon is a rectangle with one side distinguished as the
seam. Suppose that you want to sew the seam of a ribbon onto a graph
embedded in 3-space.  Even harder, suppose that you want to
simultaneously sew several ribbons on the same graph.  If the seams
intersect in a complicated way, it can be impossible to sew the ribbons in
the desired manner. <P>
In this talk we examine when these sewn ribbon complexes embed in<BR>
3-space.  We give several characterizations of these spatial ribbons<BR>
complexes.  We also consider the theoretical and algorithmic<BR>
implications of our characterizations.  The problem seems to lie right<BR>
on the boundary (assuming there is one) between polynomial and<BR>
NP-complete problems. <BR>
