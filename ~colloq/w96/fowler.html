<center><h3>States of Toeplitz-Cuntz algebras</h3></center>
<b>Abstract.</b> Motivated by work of W. Arveson on the spectral 
C*-algebra of an E_0-semigroup, we discuss how locally normal weights on a certain irreducible operator algebra can be used to 
study states of Toeplitz-Cuntz algebras. As an application, we classify
those states of the Cuntz algebra O_{\infty} whose restriction to the 
fixed point algebra under the action of the gauge group is a pure
product state.
