<center><h3>The lifting scheme: Building wavelets at home</h3></center>
<b>Abstract.</b> In this talk we present the lifting scheme, a new philosophy in wavelet constructions.  Its main difference with classical constructions is that it does not rely on the Fourier transform.  It has the following features:
<P>
<ol>
<li> Lifting allows the construction of wavelets with very little
    mathematical machinery. It therefore serves as an educational tool
    to introduce wavelets to people without a strong math
    background. The only thing one needs is polynomial interpolation,
    therefore allowing "at home" constructions.
<li> Lifting allows a faster calculation of the classical wavelet
    transform. Also, using a partial bit reversal the wavelet
    transform can be calculated fully in-place, i.e. without
    allocating extra memory. 
<li> Lifting allows the construction of wavelets in situations were no
    Fourier transform is available. These wavelets are referred to as
    "Second Generation Wavelets". Typical examples are wavelets
    adapted to weighted inner products, wavelets adapted to irregular
    sample locations, irregular meshes, and wavelets on curves,
    surfaces, and manifolds. More particularly we consider wavelets on the sphere.
<li> Lifting bridges the gap between classical wavelets and finite elements.
<li> Lifting allows custom-designed wavelets. Examples are adaptive
    wavelets, h-p wavelets, non-linear wavelets, and wavelet probing.
  </ol>

These features will be illustrated with several examples and
applications.
