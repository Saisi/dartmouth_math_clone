<B>Abstract: </B>
Matroids were introduced by Hassler Whitney in 1935 in his paper    ``On the abstract properties of linear dependence''. Whitney defined    a matroid $(E, {\cal I})$ to be a finite set and a non-empty    hereditary collection ${\cal I}$ of subsets of $E$ such that if $I$    and $J$ are in ${\cal I}$ and $|I| < |J|$, then $I \cup \{j\}$ is in    ${\cal I}$ for some $j$ in $J-I$.  Matroids arise naturally in    numerous algebraic and combinatorial contexts.  In particular, if    $E$ is any finite subset of a vector space $V$ over a field $F$ and    ${\cal I}$ is the collection of linearly independent subsets of $E$,    then $(E, {\cal I})$ is a matroid.  Such a matroid is called    $F$-representable and much of the focus of matroid theory has been    directed towards characterizing such matroids for certain particular    choices of the field $F$.  This talk will survey results in this    area culminating with some exciting recent developments.\par
