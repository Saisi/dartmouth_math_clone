<B>Abstract: </B> We present a certain global approach towards
algebraic topology.  It has grown out of work of A.K. Bousfield and
E.Dror Farjoun.  The key theme is to understand the way spaces are
built from other presumably better understood pieces (by analogy to
simplicial complexes being glued from simplices). We present a new way
of looking at traditional theorems in Algebraic Topology, generalizing
them, and giving more transparent proofs. In this way we could also
show that certain statements that seem to be not connected, are in
fact reflections of the same phenomena.  The talk is for a general
audience, and no working knowledge of Algebraic Topology is assumed. I
will try to explain ideas and give examples.

This talk will be accessible to graduate students.
