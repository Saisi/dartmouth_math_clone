<B>Abstract: </B>
Two Riemannian manifolds are said to be isotonal if the elements of the spectra are the same, but the multiplicities may be different.  In this lecture we describe general non-continuous so-called $\sigma$-deformations which provide isospectral manifolds (closed as well as manifolds with boundaries) with different local geometries.  These spaces have also the following spectral-geometric coincidences:  (1)  The geodesic balls as well as spheres with the same radius are isotonal.  (2)  The spectra on forms (i.e. the p-spectra with p>0) are just isotonoal, on the whole spaces as well as on geodesics balls and spheres.       The proof of these statements is based upon an explicit computation of the concerning spectra.
