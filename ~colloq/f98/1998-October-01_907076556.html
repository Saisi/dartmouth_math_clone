<B>Abstract: </B>
    A  multiplication on an object $X$ is a map $m:X\times X\to X$ with   certain properties which capture the axioms of associativity, unit and inverses   of a group.  An action of a  group $G$ on an object   $X$ is given in terms of a map $a:G\times X\to X$.  These notions are interesting in   many different contexts, e.g., when the objects are topological spaces, groups, monoids, etc.   The purpose of this talk is to answer the question: When can these  notions be dualized, i.e., when can all the arrows be reversed in these  definitions, and what results are obtained in the different settings?   There is a strong motivation from algebraic topology  where the duals in the case of topological spaces are   well known constructions such as  suspensions. To  define a "comultiplication" we need  the notion of a coproduct which is dual to that of a product.  This notion is available for topological spaces,  groups (the free product "$*$")  and monoids.  Thus a comultiplication on a group $G$ is a  homomorphism $m:G\to G*G$ whose composition   with the projections $G*G\to G$ is the identity. A coaction of $G$  on a group $K$ is similarly defined by a homomorphism  $G\to G*K$. In this talk   we will describe the structure  of groups (and monoids)  which admit a comultiplication or a coaction.\par    Although the motivation comes from topology, the talk will be purely algebraic.  Only a little group theory will be assumed.
