<P>Let A be a C*-algebra with unit. An unbounded Fredholm module over A
is an object that abstracts the properties of a self-adjoint, first order
elliptic pseudodifferential operator on a compact manifold. Alain Connes
has shown that a C*-algebra equipped with an unbounded Fredholm module
can be viewed as a sort of &quot;noncommutative&quot; metric space. In
my talk, I will give some examples of unbounded Fredholm modules, and I
will define a notion of an isometry of a noncommutative metric space. In
many cases, the group of such isometries has properties similar to those
enjoyed by the isometry group of a compact metric space or a compact Riemannian
manifold. I will discuss these properties and give several examples.</P>

<CENTER><P>The first half of the talk should be accessible to graduate
students.</P></CENTER>
