<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Combinatorics of Simplicial Complexes and Applications
to Complex Decision Networks</H1>

<P>In this talk we will describe a new family of combinatorial invariants
of simplicial complexes and their relationship to the dynamics of complex
decision networks. As a first approximation, one can model a decision network
as a Boolean network, and view it as a dynamical system on a finite phase
space, which carries the structure of a directed graph. To each point in
the phase space one can associate a simplicial complex which carries information
about the local dynamics of the network.</P>

<P>The invariants can be thought of as a combinatorial analog of the homotopy
theory of topological spaces and are conjecturally related to ``forcing
structures'' in the network. We shall also describe potential connections
between our combinatorial homotopy invariants and matroid theory.</P>

<P>The talk is accessible to graduate students. </P>
