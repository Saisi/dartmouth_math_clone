<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Four vignettes from mathematical finance</H1>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Dr. Richard Holmes </H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>HIM&amp;R, Inc. </H3>

<P>The relatively new discipline of &quot;financial engineering&quot; has
developed into an exciting area of applied probability and stocahstic analysis.
In this introductory talk I will discuss 4 problems from the world of finance
and investment, and show how some suitable mathematics can provide insight
into their solution. The problems, in increasing order of difficulty, are
</P>

<P>1) If you have some extra disposable income, should you use it to pay
down your mortgage? </P>

<P>2) How should you do asset allocation? </P>

<P>3) Given a bunch of random variables, representing the uncertain future
returns of some assets (securities), what determines their current prices?
</P>

<P>4) In particular, what if one of these assets depends on the price of
another? These are called &quot;derivatives&quot;, and include stock options
as a special case.</P>

<P>The relevant mathematics will be a mix of calculus, linear algebra,
and probability.</P>
