<b>Abstract.</b> A square matrix is <i> totally positive</i> if all its minors (of all sizes, including matrix entries) are positive real numbers. The study of these matrices has a long history, they play an important role in different ares of mathematics, from differential equations to combinatorics. Recently, G. Lusztig discovered a remarkable parallelism between the cone of totally positive matrices, and the canonical basis of the corresponding quantum group. We will give a survey of recent results triggered by this discovery. Some of these results (obtained jointly with A. Berenstein and S. Fomin) are of fairly classical nature. In particular, we obtain a family of criteria for total positivity: each of them says that to check that a given $n \times n$ matrix $x$ is totally positive, it is enough to check that certain $n^2$ minors of $x$ are $> 0$. <p>
