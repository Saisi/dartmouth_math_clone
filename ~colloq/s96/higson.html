<center><h3>C*-algebras and the topology of group representations</h3></center>
<b>Abstract.</b> The equivalence classes of unitary representations of a group may be organized into a topological space.   In this talk, I'll 
try to explain how C*-algebras can play a useful role in studying this 
space, and describe some recent work of Gennadi Kasparov and myself on the special case of amenable groups.
