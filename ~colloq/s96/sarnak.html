<li><b>The distribution of prime numbers</b>,<br>
	Tuesday, April 23, 7pm, Filene Auditorium,<br>
	There will be a reception from 8:30-11:30 at the Dent Cabin.
<p>This year marks the 100th anniversary of the proof
of the prime number theorem. We give an account of this celebrated
theorem as well as some recent developments.
<p>
<li><b>The spectral nature of the zeros of zeta functions</b>,<br>
	Wednesday, April 24, 4pm, 102 Bradley Hall,<br>
	There will be high tea at 3:30 in the Lounge of Bradley Hall.
<p>The distribution of the spacings between the zeros
of the Riemann zeta function reveals a striking relation to the
spectra of random matrices. We will describe and explain(to the
extent that it is understood) this phenomenon.
<p>
<li><b>Spectra of Riemannian manifolds</b>,<br>
	Thursday, April 25, 4pm, 102 Bradley Hall,<br>
	There will be high tea at 3:30 in the Lounge of Bradley Hall.
<p>We survey some direct and inverse problems in spectral
geometry, that is, the relation between a manifold and its spectrum.
