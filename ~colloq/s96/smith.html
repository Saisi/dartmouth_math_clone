<center><h3>Derivations and automorphisms of operator algebras</h3></center>
<b>Abstract.</b> Derivations and automorphisms of operator algebras are two of the classical objects of algebra and operator algebras. In this talk we will discuss a general class of operator algebras for which it is possible to determine both the automorphism groups and the spaces of derivations. With a simple description available, we will then illustrate various phenomena which can occur, and give some applications to the operator algebras themselves.

This talk is intended for a general audience and essentially no background knowlege is assumed.
