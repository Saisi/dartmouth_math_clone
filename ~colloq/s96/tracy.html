<center><h3>Random Matrices and Completely Integrable Systems</h3></center>
<b>Abstract.</b> Random matrices and in particular eigenvalues of random matrices have a long history both in physics and mathematics beginning with the work of Wigner, Dyson, Mehta and others. The widespread applications of the various distribution functions associated with random matrices are due to their apparent universality.  These distribution functions are in turn tau-functions associated to completely integrable systems of partial (and ordinary) differential equations.  This somewhat surprising connection allows a degree of analysis of these distribution functions that was not previously possible.

This talk will survey these recent developments concentrating on some special cases that illuminate the general theory.
