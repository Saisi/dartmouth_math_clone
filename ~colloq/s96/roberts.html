<center><h3>Competition Numbers and their Applications</h3></center> 
<b>Abstract.</b>  If D is an acyclic digraph, its competition graph is an undirected graph with the same vertex set and an edge between vertices x and y if there is a vertex a so that (x,a) and (y,a) are both arcs of D. Competition graphs arose in connection with an application in ecology and also have applications in coding, radio transmission, and modeling of complex economic systems.  If G is any graph, G together with sufficiently many isolated vertices is a competition graph, and the competition number of G is the smallest number of such isolated vertices.  The problem of recognizing competition graphs is equivalent to the problem of computing the competition number, and this problem is known to be NP-complete.  
<p>
This talk will explore a number of old open problems concerning competition numbers, and provide detailed recent results about two of these problems:  The problem of when an elimination algorithm (motivated by a graph-theoretical approach to Gaussian elimination) can be used to compute the competition number and the problem of computing the competition numbers of graphs with a small number of triangles.
