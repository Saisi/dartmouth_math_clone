<center><h3>Analytic Geometry in Characteristic p</h3></center> 
<b>Abstract.</b> Many concepts from real and complex geometry carry over to geometry
over fields of characteristic $p>0$.  The field $K = {\bf Z}/p((x))$,
like R or C, is metrically complete, and this allows us to do analytic
geometry over K.  While analysis over $K$ is in many ways similar to
real and complex analysis, there are also many differences, and some
concepts which are easy in one setting are harder in the other.  For
example, a series in $K$ converges if and only if the terms go to
zero.  On the other hand, analytic continuation does not carry over
easily to $K$ because the topology is totally disconnected.  In this
talk, after surveying $K$-analytic spaces, we will consider the
problem of finding the fundamental group of compact ``Riemann
Surfaces'' without boundary in characteristic $p>0$.
