<B>Abstract: </B>

A matroid is a generalization of the (in)dependence properties shared
by a finite set of points in a vector space and sets of edges in a
graph.  One can study some matroid properties by looking at several
topological  spaces that are defined purely by combinatorial data.  A
(combinatorial)   Laplacian is a linear self-map of a chain complex
that reveals homology   and some additional structure. 
<P>
 This talk
will introduce the ideas above and attempt to show how an   explicit
description of a certain Laplacian's eigenspaces relates to
enumerative questions and applies to the theory of hyperplane
arrangements.

<P>
This talk will be accessible to graduate students.
