<B>Abstract: </B>
In this talk we present some recent results related to Schubert and  Grothendieck polynomials. These polynomials represent Schubert classes,  which form the natural bases of the cohomology and K-theory of the  complex flag variety. We present background information on several  combinatorial constructions of Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials.  Then we present the solution to a conjecture concerning the relationship  between these polynomials, and some results related to the main open  problem in the theory of Schubert polynomials, which is the  Littlewood-Richardson rule. The latter concerns a combinatorial  description of the structure constants of the ring of polynomials in  infinitely many variables with respect to its basis of Schubert  polynomials. Combinatorial methods, mainly related to the Bruhat order  on the symmetric group, play a major role in our work.
