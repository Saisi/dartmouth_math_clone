<B>Abstract: </B>
The Hecke algebras of type $A$ arise naturally in the study of knot
theory, quantum groups, and Von Neumann algebras. Their relation to
the symmetric and braid groups allows for their study using
combinatorics and low dimensional topology.

<P>
 In this talk I will define the Hecke algebras of type $A$ and $B$ and
 show their relation to the symmetric group and the braid group (this
 groups will be defined in this talk).  I will also construct a
 beautiful homomorphism from a specialization of the Hecke algebra of
 type $B$ onto a reduced Hecke algebra of type $A$. I will show how
 this homomorphism can be used to compute some traces on the Hecke
 algebra of type $B$, called Markov traces. If time permits, I will
 give other applications of this homomorphism.
</P>

<P>
This talk will be accessible to graduate students.
