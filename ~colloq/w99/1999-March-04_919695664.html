<B>Abstract: </B>
The phenomenon of chaotic synchronization has   attracted much attention in the last decade due to   its applicability in modeling and safe communications, as well  as its importance in biological and physical systems.  Until recently a mathematical framework for the description  and analysis of this phenomenon was still lacking.   In this talk I will give a number of examples   of chaotic synchronization, and argue that many of them   can naturally be described in terms of normally hyperbolic invariant  manifolds.
