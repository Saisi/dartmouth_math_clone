<B>Abstract: </B> We will learn to play with combinatorial structures,
tableaux, in such a way that important properties of symmetric
functions are revealed.  In particular, we will introduce several
bases for the space of symmetric functions and show how they can be
represented using tableaux.  Further, we will discuss the Macdonald
polynomials, a fascinating generalization for most fundamental bases
of the symmetric function space. We will present a simple method for
building sets of tableaux and show the role of these sets in a
longstanding Macdonald conjecture.
