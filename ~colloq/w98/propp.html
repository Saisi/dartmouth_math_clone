<P>A tiling is a way of covering a region with pieces (&quot;tiles&quot;)
so that there are no gaps or overlaps between the tiles. It is not surprising
that there can be very many ways of tiling a large finite region with tiles
of a specified shape and size. What is surprising is that there are tiling-problems
such that, if you choose randomly from the set of tilings, the tiling you
get is very likely to look very un-random! I will describe why this is
true, and talk about the role undergraduate research assistants have played
in this work.</P>
