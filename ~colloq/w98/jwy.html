<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>The Rogers-Ramanujan Identities</H3>

<P>The Rogers-Ramanujan identities are among the most beautiful equations
in mathematics. Although initially introduced in the number theoretic setting
of continued fractions, these identities also appear in conformal field
theory, character theory of affine Lie algebras, and in statistical mechanics.
This talk, based on thesis work, will describe the appearance of these
identities in two new settings: the finite general linear groups and symmetric
function theory.</P>

Wavelets and Multiwavelets</H3>

A function phi(t) is _refinable scaling_ if it satisfies a dilation equation
phi(t) = sum_k C_k phi(2t-k). A refinable function generates multiresolution
analysis (MRA): a set of nested subspaces ... V_{-1} \subset V_0 \subset
V_1 ... such that the union of the V_k = L^2(R) and the intersection of
all the V_k is the empty set. Translates phi(t-k) form a basis of V_0.
Another part of MRA is a wavelet w(t), whose translates w(t-k) generate
a subspace W_0 such that V_{1} is the direct sum of V_0 and W_0. Then {w(2^jt-k)
| j,k \in Z} is a basis of L^2(R).</P>

<P>Standard scalar MRA assumes that there is only one scaling function.
We make a step forward and allow several of them: \phi_0(t), ... ,\phi_{r-1}(t).
The vector Phi(t) = [phi_0(t) ... phi_{r-1}(t)^T satisfies a dilation equation
with _matrix_ coefficients C_k. Associated with phi(t) is a multiwavelet
w(t) = [w_0(t) ... w_{r-1}(t)]^T. Multiwavelets have new features arising
from the matrix structure of the dilation equation. For example, a multi-scaling
function can combine orthogonality, symmetry and high approximation order
while a scalar scaling function cannot.</P>
