<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Homotopy Theory and Closed Geodesics</H1>

<P>Given a compact Riemannian manifold M, one can ask whether there is
a closed geodesic lying on M and further, if so, how many? A long standing
conjecture is that there are infinitely many closed geodesics. In this
talk, I will explain how this problem divides up into a geometric and a
homotopy-theoretic part and I will discuss progress on the homotopy-theoretic
side. </P>

<CENTER><P>Much of the talk will be elementary and accessible to graduate
students.</P></CENTER>
