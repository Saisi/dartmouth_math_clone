<P>The study of group actions on C*-algebras (&quot;noncommutative dynamics&quot;)
has been a central theme of C*-theory for many years now. But some C*-algebras
(Cuntz-Krieger algebras, for example) don't quite fit into the framework
of group actions---it's necessary to allow actions by &quot;group-like&quot;
objects, including groupoids and inverse semigroups. In joint work with
Nandor Sieben, we've recently been able to show a strong correspondence
between actions of r-discrete groupoids and of inverse semigroups. I'll
focus upon a &quot;curious&quot; (to me, anyway) partition of unity argument
we had to scrape together to show an isomorphism of the associated crossed
product C*-algebras. This argument has nothing to do with C*-algebras per
se, and can be regarded as an answer to the question, &quot;How much collapsing
occurs when we identify functions which agree on overlaps?&quot; Time permitting,
I'll indicate how this leads to the crossed product isomorphism.</P>
