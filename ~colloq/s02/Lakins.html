<p>An infinite version of Ramsey's theorem states that for every coloring
of
<br>$[\omega]^n$ (the set of all $n$--element subsets of $\omega$) by finitely
<br>many colors, there is an infinite set $A$ which is homogeneous for
that
<br>coloring, i.e., all elements of $[A]^n$ have the same color. After
an
<br>introduction to the necessary background in computability theory, we
<br>present a survey of results concerning the complexity of infinite
<br>homogeneous sets for effectively given (computable or computably
<br>enumerable) colorings.
