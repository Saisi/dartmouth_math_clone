<p>A key problem of homotopy theory is to determine
<br>if a given map f: X --> Y between two spaces is
<br>homotopic to the constant map. This is a hard problem
<br>which becomes much more difficult if the domain X
<br>is infinite dimensional. One way to reduce the really
<br>hard case to the merely hard case is to look for a
<br>finite dimensional space K and a map g: K --> X such
<br>that the composition K --> X --> Y is not trivial (i.e.,
<br>homotopic to the constant map). If there is such a map
<br>g then f cannot be trivial. However, it is possible that
<br>there is no such map g and yet f is not the trivial map:
<br>such a map f is called a phantom map.
<p>Phantom maps are, by definition, hard to understand.
<br>It is known that if there is one nontrivial phantom map
<br>from X to Y, then there are uncountably many. Until
<br>recently, however, there was no way to
<br>distinguish any one of these maps from any other.
<br>This talk will start from the definition of homotopy
<br><font color="#FF0000">(attention, graduate students!)</font>, wind
its way through
<br>some of the standard theory, and end with some new
<br>ideas which enable us to distinguish phantom maps from
<br>one another, and which show the existence of even
<br>phantom-er maps.
