<p>Abstract:
<p>Orbifolds are a class of singular spaces which are locally given as
<br>the quotient space of a smooth manifold modulo a finite group. Such
<br>objects appear naturally in geometry and topology. For example, the
<br>reduced space of a symplectic reduction is often naturally an
<br>(symplectic) orbifold. Algebraic varieties with quotient singularity
<br>are also examples of orbifolds (e.g. Calabi-Yau orbifolds). Orbifolds
<br>also appear in the theories in physics, e.g. orbifold topological sigma
<br>models.
<p>An orbifold $X$ is called "good" if it is globally the quotient space
<br>of a manifold $Y$ modulo a discrete group $G$. There are examples of
<br>"bad" orbifolds (e.g. Thurston's teardrop orbifold), and there are
<br>currently no effective ways to tell if a given orbifold is good,
<br>unless it is given a priori as such an orbifold. A good orbifold $X=Y/G$
<br>apparently carries an extra structure --- the "equivariant" topology
or
<br>geometry of the $G$-manifold $Y$.
<p>We will discuss an ongoing project which aims at making sense of
<br>the said "equivariant" aspect of good orbifolds for general orbifolds.
<br>At the heart of this project is a class of natural morphisms between
<br>orbifolds, generalizing equivariant maps between $G$-manifolds. If
time
<br>permits, we will relate this work with some recent studies of orbifolds
<br>which are related to string theory.
