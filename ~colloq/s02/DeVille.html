<p><font color="#FF0000">"Simplifying equations for a thin plate"</font>
<p>We will consider wave propagation through a thin plate, i.e. a solid
which
<br>has one thin direction and two thick directions. This wave propagation
is
<br>governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) defined on three
spatial
<br>dimensions. We will focus on the question: When can we replace the
3D
<br>equation(s) with a PDE defined on two spatial dimensions, and what
will the
<br>2D equations be?
<p>If the plate is thin enough, we can make the replacement, and furthermore,
<br>we will see that there is a hierarchy of 2D PDEs, each of which affords
a
<br>better approximation to the real equations. The viewpoint taken here
is to
<br>consider the dynamics on this plate as an infinite-dimensional dynamical
<br>system of coupled oscillators.
<p>The talk will not emphasize the technical aspects of the theory, and
is
<br>intended to be accessible to all students who have had a class in ordinary
<br>differential equations.
