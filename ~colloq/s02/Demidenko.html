<p>Many biological studies confirmed that the growth of
<br>unpertubated cancer tumor follows Gompertz curve, which can
<br>be defined via a simple ODE. While there are several
<br>complicated biomathematical models to describe cell
<br>population, construction of parsimonious (specified by a
<br>small number of parameters) tumor re-growth model is a long-
<br>standing problem of mathematical cancer biology. I show how
<br>to construct such curves based on the four compartment cell
<br>cycle model. This model fits real life data incredible
<br>well. An important application of the re-growth curve
<br>theory is the ability (a) to recover cell kill in vivo (b)
<br>determine the supra-additive effect when several treatments
<br>are combined. The ideas are illustrated on real life cancer
<br>data experiments.
<p>This talk is about applied mathematics where emphasis is on
<br>conceptual not technical matters.
<p>This talk requires just basic calculus and some ordinary
<br>differential equation theory. All needed biological terms
<br>and notions will be introduced. Thus it is accessible even
<br>for undergraduate students.
