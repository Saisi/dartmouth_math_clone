<br>&nbsp;
<p>Abstract: Error-correcting codes are widely used to correct errors in
<br>either the transmission or storage of information. An error-correcting
code
<br>provides the high fidelity on compact discs. Because of their demonstrated
<br>practical usefulness, electrical engineers started studying these codes
<br>about fifty years ago. Now they are studied by engineers, mathematicians
<br>and computer scientists and a wide theory has been developed with many
<br>connections to mathematical topics.
<br>I will give all the basic definitions with examples and main problems
in
<br>error-correcting codes. We will discuss Hamming decoding and perfect
codes.
<p>We will use this to determine "what color is my hat".
<p>Self-dual codes are an interesting class of codes which include
<br>many very good codes. These codes are also related to interesting
<br>designs, interesting groups and lattices. The extended Golay codes
<br>over GF(2) and GF(3) are self-dual as is the [8,4,4] binary Hamming
<br>code and the [6,3,4] Hexacode over GF(4). The weight enumerators
<br>of these codes provide an upper bound on their minimum weights.
<p>Self-dual codes over GF(2), GF(3),and GF(4) were classified from
<br>the early seventies until the early eighties. We describe new
<br>classifications of codes over Z4, formally self-dual codes and additive
<br>GF(4) codes (for quantum computing).
