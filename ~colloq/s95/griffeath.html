<dd>A <i>cellular automaton</i> (CA) is a discrete dynamics, generated by 
repeated application of a parallel update rule, that evolves as a 
sequence of lattice configurations, or a digital movie if you will. This 
paradigm, which goes back to Ulam and von Neumann in the late 1940s, and 
was popularized by Conway's Game of Life in the 70s and Wolfram's 
experimental work in the 80s, is currently used to model the 
phenomenology of linear and nonlinear systems in many areas of applied 
science. The advent of interactive computer visualization enables a 
systematic investigation of CA rules in a way that was unthinkable without 
such technology. The method of analysis, which combines empirical 
observation (<i>thoughtful</i> movie watching) with traditional deductive 
reasoning, provides a stimulating case study of contemporary directions 
in mathematics.<p>

<dd>My goal is to illustrate these themes in a series of three computer 
demonstrations. The titles of my presentations, the first of which is 
intended for a general audience, are as follows:<p>

<center><b>I. Cellular Automata as Toy Universes<p>

II. The Mathematics of Excitable Cellular Automata<p>

III. The Mathematics of Threshold Growth<p></b></center>

<dd>For the past two years I have been working, with Bob Fisch, on the
development of effective, interactive simulation tools for the study of
CA rules. We are designing two platforms in parallel:<p>

<UL TYPE=square> <LI>a high-end simulator based on the new <b>CAM8</b>
cellular automaton machine
     from MIT<br>(Margolus and Toffoli);<p>

<LI>a low-end (MS) Windows simulator and graphical front end called 
<i>WinCA</i>.<p></UL>

<dd>These platforms, especially the latter, will be the focus of in my 
lectures. Anyone interested in downloading <i>WinCA</i>, or previewing 
some of the computer graphics and research topics that I will discuss, 
should check out my home page on the World Wide Web, the <b>Primordial 
Soup Kitchen</b>:<p>

Net that deal with cellular automata, interacting particles, and other 
complex spatially-distributed systems.<p>
