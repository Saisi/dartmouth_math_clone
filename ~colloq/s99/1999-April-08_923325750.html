<B>Abstract: </B> There is an ancient philosphical-religious divide
 over questions of infinity.  This divide extends over mathematics and
 we see it in many forms.  A perfect example is offered by the twin
 approaches to analysis: limits and infinitesimals.  With Robinson's
 discovery of nonstandard analysis, both approaches have achieved
 legitimacy.
<P>
 Today, there is a new approach, non-nonstandard analysis, which, in a
 sense disolves the old barriers.  On the one hand, the language of
 non-nonstandard analysis is frankly infinite.  On the other hand, it
 is thoroughly standard underneath.  
<P> 
The program of
 non-nonstandard analysis is to reproduce the achievements of
 nonstandard analysis, but without recourse to the Axiom of Choice or
 extensive logical machinery.  We will discuss a recent success,
 Loeb-like measures, and an application which hopes to bring together
 the most radical finitists and infinitists.
</P>

<P>
This talk will be accessible to graduate students.
