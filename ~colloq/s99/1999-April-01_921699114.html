<B>Abstract: </B>
Over the past ten years, wavelets have emerged as   popular bases for powerful new transforms   used for image compression and signal processing.  This talk   will begin with an introduction to how wavelets   naturally arise in these contexts.  The more classical   Fourier transform has been employed as a central tool   in the construction and analysis of wavelets in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.    In the body of the talk, we will examine wavelets by using instead the unitary   representations of the groups whose actions underlie the   wavelet structures.  This more abstract approach leads   to a generalization of the related concept of a   multiresolution analysis and to the construction of new   examples of wavelets.
