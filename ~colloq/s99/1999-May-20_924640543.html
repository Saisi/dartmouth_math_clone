<B>Abstract: </B>
The automorphism tower of a group is obtained by computing its automorphism   group, the automorphism group of {\it that} group and so on, iterating   transfinitely. Each group maps into the next using inner automorphisms and one   takes a direct limit at limit stages. The question is whether the process ever   terminates in a fixed point, a group which is isomorphic to its automorphism   group by the natural map. The classical result (Wielandt 1939) is that the   automorphism tower of any finite centerless group terminates in finitely many   steps. Hulse (1970) showed that the tower of any centerless polycyclic group   terminates in countably many steps. Simon Thomas (1985), in an elegant argument,  proved that the tower of any centerless group eventually terminates. Here, I   will prove that every group has a terminating automorphism tower. After this,   in a somewhat more metaphysical endeavor, I will discuss the essentially   set-theoretic nature of the automorphism tower of a group, showing that it is   consistent that a single group has, in various models of set theory, wildly   diverging automorphism towers, whose heights can be almost arbitrarily   specified.
