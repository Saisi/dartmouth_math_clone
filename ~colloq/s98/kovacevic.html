<P>A large fraction of the information that flows across today's networks
is useful even in a degraded condition. Examples include still images,
speech, audio, and video. When this information is subject to packet losses
or retransmission is impossible due to real-time constraints, superior
performance with respect to total transmitted rate, distortion, and delay
may sometimes be achieved by adding redundancy to the bit stream rather
than repeating lost packets. </P>

<P>In multiple description coding, a joint source-channel method, the data
is broken into several streams with some redundancy among the streams.
When all the streams are received, one can guarantee low distortion at
the expense of having a slightly higher bit rate than a system designed
purely for compression. On the other hand, when only some of the streams
are received, the quality of the reconstruction degrades gracefully, which
is very unlikely to happen with a system designed purely for compression.
</P>

<P>We will motivate the use of multiple descriptions and review some of
its information theoretical beginnings. We will then discuss two practical
approaches: one quantizer based and the other transform based. Finally,
we will outline possible applications. </P>
