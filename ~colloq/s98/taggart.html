<P>The class one principal series Whittaker functions W_{n,a}(z) are central
to the Fourier development of automorphic forms on GL(n,R). Of particular
interest are the Mellin transforms M_{n,a}(s) of W_{n,a}(z). Until recently,
explicit formulas for M_{n,a}(s) had been deduced only for n &lt;= 4. In
this talk, I will discuss joint work with Eric Stade that gives an explicit
formula for M_{5,a}(s) as a double integral of Barnes type. Further, we
use identities among hypergeometric series of type _4F_3(1) to show that,
for special values of s, this Mellin transform reduces to a ratio of gamma
functions.</P>

<P>This talk should be accessible to all.</P>
