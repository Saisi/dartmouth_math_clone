<p><font size="+1"><b>General Comments on the Course: </b></font>

</p>




<li>This course is open to undergraduates and graduate students and is cross-listed as Math 74 (undergraduates) and Math 114 (graduate students). It is an introductory course in Algebraic Topology. The prerequisites are Math 31 or 71 (Abstract Algebra) and Math 54 (Topology, also known as general or point-set topology) or the equivalents. Anyone not sure of having sufficient prerequisites should see the instructor. Because the final grades for undergraduates are based on a different scheme from those for graduate students, the homework requirements will be different for the two groups. This will be explained in class. The material of the course is naturally divided into two parts. The first part consists of the fundamental group and covering spaces. It should be completed in the fourth week of the term. The remainder of the term will be spent on homology theory. Because there is a large amount of material to cover, the x-hours will be used, probably every other week.
</li>

<ul>
  <li> On Exams: No help given or received.  <br></li>
</ul>

<ul>  
<li>On Homework: Students are encouraged to work together with one or two classmates and/or to seek help from the instructor. Office hours are on Tuesday, the day before homework is due, and students are strongly encouraged to come by for help.   Students should state on their homework paper the names of those with whom they have collaborated. What is important in doing homework is the eventual comprehension of the solution of the problem. 
When a student writes up a homework problem it is to be his or her own understanding of how to solve the problem. The solutions that a student submits must be written by him or her alone. Any copying of another person's solutions will be regarded as a violation of the Honor Code.</i> <br></li>
