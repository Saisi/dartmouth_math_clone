has been known in practice
(though not expressed in this way)
for about four thousand years.
More complicated formulas for the solution of cubic
and quartic equations by radicals were found in the 1500s.  In 1824,
Abel published his proof that the quintic equation can't be
solved by radicals, but this was not the end of the line:  In 1884,
Klein showed how to solve the quintic using transcendental functions
arising from the study of the icosahedron.  This is possible because
the icosahedron has symmetry group <I>A</I><SUB>5</SUB>, which is the simple
group standing in the way of an expression in terms of radicals.

<P>
In 1989 Curt McMullen and I showed how to solve the quintic using
a tower of purely iterative algorithms.  The key ingredient was a
dynamical system with the symmetries of the icosahedron, or as we like
to say, `with the symmetries of the soccer ball'.  The soccer ball has
the same symmetries as the icosahedron:  Combinatorially, it is a
<I>truncated icosahedron</I>, with 12 pentagons corresponding to the
vertices of the icosahedron and 20 hexagons corresponding to the
faces.  But up until now, the soccer ball has played no direct role in
the solution of the quintic.

<P>
In this course, our goal will be to compress the tower of iterations
for solving the quintic by solving for all five roots at once.
The key ingredient will be the `soccer map', an
iteration intimately tied to the soccer ball.  This is joint, ongoing
work with Scott Crass.
