If you're new to Matlab, check out these links from Alex Barnett on
how to download it and get started:

The Computer Help Desk in Baker-Berry can help you with issues you
have getting Matlab going on your machine.
Bring your laptop to class so we can play explore Matlab together.
To get a head start, check out
Alex Barnett's `bare essentials of Matlab':

at the earliest, but look at them now, so that on Wednesday we can see
how things are going.

</LI>
<LI>Get hold of a copy of Grinstead and Snell's `Introduction to
Probability', available at Wheelock Books.  This book is available for
free download on the web, but I guarantee you'll want a printed copy.

Roger Flynn, `Tactics and Strategy in Squash':

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The International Rules of Squash Racquets only allow us to score a point when we are Hand-in (serving) at which time our opponents (Hand-out) are not permitted to score.
If that is the case then ...when Hand-in, our sole objective should be to attack our opponents with as much gusto as we are able and to take whatever risks are necessary in order to create the most difficult shots for our opponents to return (ie. hit the ball as far away from our opponent as possible).
When we are Hand-out however, only our opponent is permitted to score a point and ...our obligation is to stop him/her from scoring. This is best achieved by changing our attack to the back of the court so that our risk of error is minimal and we also push our opponent into the most difficult part of the court from which to play a winner.

<P>
In problem 3.2.34(b), note that the program Grinstead and Snell are asking for is to compute the probability using the formula of part (a),
rather than estimating it by simulation.
You may get warnings from matlab about possibly inaccurate results when <I>n</I> is 100 or bigger:  Don't fret about this.

<P>
Of course, I think you should do a simulation as well.
This can be done in various ways.
One approach is illustrated in this snippet,
which generates 20 random numbers between 1 and 10
and reports how many distinct numbers occur:
<PRE>
length(unique(ceil(rand(1,20)*10)))
</PRE>
Here's another snippet to compute the <I>k</I> in problem 3.1.23.
Note the use of `break' to jump out of the loop:
<PRE>
for k=1:n-1
  s=sum(1./[k:n-1]);
  if s&lt;=1
      break
  end
end

Things to ponder:

<P>
1.  What happens in the Polya urn model if you put in *two* new balls of the chosen color, instead of just one?  What about if you put in a ball of the opposite color?

<P>
2.  In the Monty Hall problem, why can't you win more than 2/3 of the time, even if Monty has a bias about which door he will open when he has a choice?  If there are n doors, and he opens one door, show that under some rule for which door he opens, you can win a fraction (n-1)/n of the time.  I'm sure this is the bast you can hope for, but how to prove it?
