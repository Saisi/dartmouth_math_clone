Beginning Monday 26 September, we will be holding a weekly
workshop on computing in mathematics, Mondays 3:00-4:50.  The goal is
to promote the use of computing to investigate and solve
problems in pure and applied math.  This fall the focus will be on the
computer algebra systems Sage and Magma:  For details, see below.

<P>

<P>
Ben Linowitz will lead sessions on Sage, Magma, and quaternion
algebras.  You should plan to bring a laptop to the sessions (or a
friend with a laptop).  Make sure your machine is able to connect to
the Dartmouth Secure network.  And please check beforehand that you
are able to access the math department's Sage notebook server at
<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="http://sage.dartmouth.edu">http://sage.dartmouth.edu</A>
(only available to users on campus).

<P>
Session 1 (26 Sep 2011). Introduction to Sage. Sage is a versatile, free sytem for
mathematical computing, based on the computer language Python.  The
goal of this session will be to introduce the Sage system, its
capabilities, and its syntax. This will be accessible to a general
audience, though some examples will be drawn from Math 22/24 and 31.

<P>
Session 2 (3 Oct 2011). Quadratic Number Fields. This session will be spent
studying quadratic number fields and their ideals. The explicitness
inherit to these fields should make this session accessible to
students who have taken Math 81 (or perhaps even just Math 71).

<P>
Sessions 3,4. Algebraic number fields. In these sessions we'll talk
about more general algebraic number fields, the way that rational
primes factor in these extensions and the ideal class group. None of
the material covered in these sessions will be taken from the Math 81
syllabus, but we won't be moving too quickly and students who have
taken Math 81 should definitely get something out of attending.

<P>
Session 5. Magma and Quaternion algebras. Magma is an extrememly
powerful, non-free computer algebra system.  The goal of this session
will be twofold.  We will begin by introducing Magma.   We will then
define quaternion algebras and use Magma to compute examples of
quaternion algebras with various interesting properties. As far as
prerequisites go, exposure to algebra at the graduate level would be
desirable.

<P>
Session 6 and onwards. Quaternion orders and spectral geometry. We'll
define orders in quaternion algebras and study their arithmetic. The
eventual goal will be to use these orders in order to produce, using
magma, very nice examples of isospectral non-isometric hyperbolic
surfaces. The first known example using this method is due to
Marie-France Vigneras. Not only will our examples be substantially
simpler than those constructed by Vigneras, but using magma we will be
able to show that our examples are the best possible using Vigneras'
method.
