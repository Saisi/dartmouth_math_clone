<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
This course is intended as an introduction to math beyond calculus.
It is primarily meant to appeal to first-year students who have
completed Math 8, 11, 12, or 13.  The idea is to introduce math that
is fun, challenging, and important,
and prepare and inspire you to major in math.

<P>
This is a topics course, with no set material that we have to go through.
This year, the focus will be on Polya's theorem
that a random walker on an infinite street network in <I>d</I>-dimensional space
is bound to return to the starting point when <I>d</I> = 2,
but has a positive probability of escaping to infinity
without returning to the starting point when <I>d</I> <IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~doyle/docs/17/17/img1.png"
 ALT="$ \geq$"> 3.
Our goal will be to interpret this theorem as a statement
about electric networks,
and then to prove the theorem
using techniques from classical electrical theory.

<P>
We'll be discussing a lot of other topics as well:
Polya's theorem is a point of departure, not a fixed destination.
Some topics will be more accessible than others, and I don't expect all
students to follow everything.  There won't be any formal exams,
though there will be quizzes on things that I think every student
should master.  A big emphasis will be on computer explorations,
and major independent projects, which will demand a lot of work.
A motivated student coming from Math 8 should be able to do fine
in the course.  At the same time, I hope that a lot of what we do
will be challenging to students coming out of Math 12.
(There will also be some upperclass students in the class,
and I hope they will enjoy it, but the class is primarily aimed
at first-years.)

<P>
An important component of the course will be learning basic Matlab programming,
and the mathematical typesetting language Latex.
A good reference for Matlab is Toby Driscoll's `Learning Matlab',
which I've ordered as a text for the course:

<BR><A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="http://tinyurl.com/driscollmatlab">http://tinyurl.com/driscollmatlab</A>

It's available at Wheelock Books.

</H1>

<P>
Our first class will be Wednesday 5 January.  Before then, please
email me, telling a little about your math background.  Specifically,
have you studied probability?  Linear algebra?  Differential
equations?  Also, what physics have you studied?  Have you done any
computer programming?  If so, have you used Matlab?  And by any chance
have you used Latex?

<P>
It would be great if you could try installing Matlab on your laptop as
soon as possible.  Look here:

<BR><A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="http://caligari.dartmouth.edu/downloads/matlab/">http://caligari.dartmouth.edu/downloads/matlab/</A>
<BR>
Note that the installation instructions will be in the <TT>README_Install</TT>
file in the download folder.   If you succeed getting this installed,
try evaluating these two commands:
<PRE>
x=2*3.^-[1:10]*(rand(10,10^4)&lt;1/2); % Pick points from the Cantor set
stairs([min(x) sort(x)],0:1/length(x):1) % Plot the c.d.f.
</PRE>

<P>
You could also try installing Tex.  For Mac, go here:

<BR><A NAME="tex2html5"
  HREF="http://www.tug.org/mactex">http://www.tug.org/mactex</A>
<BR>
For Windows, go here:

<BR><A NAME="tex2html6"
  HREF="http://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html">http://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html</A>
<BR>
Use the Texworks front end, which works on both Mac and Windows.  Try
typesetting the course text:

<BR><A NAME="tex2html7"
  HREF="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~doyle/docs/walkspdf/walks.zip">http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~doyle/docs/walkspdf/walks.zip</A>
<BR>(Be sure to select format
pdflatex, which is not the default format, from the drop-down menu
next to the green arrow, and hit typeset a couple of times to get the
table of contents.)

<P>
Let me know how this all goes!  If nothing works, don't despair.  I
just want you to try this now so we can see what problems arise.

Matlab</A>
</H3>
Remember that for Friday, I am asking you to bring your laptops to class, with Matlab up and running.   Susan Schwarz, the campus Matlab administrator, has offered her help.  You can contact her if you run into questions or problems when installing Matlab.
Her email is <TT>Susan.A.Schwarz@dartmouth.edu</TT>
<BR>
The key thing is to try this right away, so there is time to get any problems straightened out by Friday.  If you can get Tex installed, as well, so much the better.

<P>
Remember that, as I mentioned in class today, the Matlab license
manager needs an authorized connection to the Dartmouth network while you are using Matlab.
Ethernet and Dartmouth Secure work for this; Dartmouth Public does not.
Well actually, you <I>can</I> use Dartmouth Public if you fire up VPN:

<BR><A NAME="tex2html8"
  HREF="https://gateway.dartmouth.edu/">https://gateway.dartmouth.edu/</A>

<P>
You should begin work on your course `portfolio'.
Your portfolio will consist of a single folder with title yourname,
which you will bundle into a file yourname.zip and email to me every Wednesday
before class.
The key ingredient will be a file
journal.pdf (with accompanying Latex source journal.tex)
which will keep a record of your progress in the course.
I will be asking for you to complete specific assignments,
e.g. writing programs or answering questions,
and among the things your journal should include
are your work (or links to your work) on these assignments.
This is just a start.
Your journal should also describe your independent work
associated with the course, and in particular, the progress you make
picking and completing major course `projects'.

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00070200000000000000">
Projects</A>
</H3>

<P>
You will be completing two major course projects, on any mathematical topic
of your choice.
The two projects will give you a chance to do an investigation on your own.   Projects need not involve a Matlab component, though I expect most projects will have one.  The first project will be due at the end of the sixth week of the term, or thereabouts.  The second project will be due on the last day of classes, when students will present their projects in a poster session.  The second project may be either an extension of the first project, or an entirely new project.  You may work together in pairs on these projects if you choose.

<P>
You will be recording progress on your projects in your portfolios.
This is important, because it is the most effective way for me to give you
timely feedback.  As you can guess, the key to doing a good project is to
get going on it early, and get plenty of feedback on how it is going.

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00070400000000000000">
Honor Code</A>
</H3>

<P>
Students are encouraged to work together on homework assignments.
What is important is a student's eventual understanding of homework problems, and not how that is achieved. The honor principle applies to homework in the following way. What a student turns in as a written homework solution is to be his or her own understanding of how to do the problem. Students must state what sources they have consulted, with whom they have collaborated, and from whom they have received help. Students are discouraged from using solutions to problems that may be posted on the web, and as just stated, must reference them if they use them. The solutions you submit must be written by you alone. Any copying (electronic or otherwise) of another person's solutions, in whole or in part, is a violation of the Honor Code.

<P>
On projects, no copying of text, computer code, or graphics will be permitted without prior written permission from me.

<P>
If you have any questions as to whether some action would be acceptable under the Academic Honor Code, please speak to me, and I will be glad to help clarify things. It is always easier to ask beforehand than to have trouble later!

<P>
I encourage any students with disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities such as chronic diseases and learning disabilities, to discuss appropriate accommodations with me, which might help you with this class, either after class or during office hours. Dartmouth College has an active program to help students with disabilities, and I am happy to do whatever I can to help out, as appropriate.

<UL>
<LI>The purpose of having you edit in the answers to the pretest is to make sure
you understand what the correct answers are, and to give you a little
practice with Latex.
On Monday we can work on Latex.
Also, we can discuss the answers that we didn't go over.
</LI>
<LI>The main purpose of having you write about the Taylor series for <I>e</I><SUP>z</SUP> and its
relatives is that you come to
understand and remember these series,
The best way to understand something is to try to explain it.
Imagine that someone has asked you to explain what the deal is with all
these series, and how you can remember them.
What would you say, or rather, write?
In Latex, of course.
Because another goal here is to practice writing in Latex.
</LI>
<LI>As for Markov chains and the Koch snowflake, on Monday we will discuss these,
and how to deal with them in Matlab.
Of course you can look them up before that!
</LI>
<LI>Regarding how to present the results of Matlab investigations,
one very good way is by using a Matlab notebook, like the matlabdemo.m
notebook linked to above.
From this you can publish to html, and from there print to pdf:

<BR><A NAME="tex2html18"
  HREF="../matlab/matlabdemo.pdf">http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~doyle/docs/17/matlab/matlabdemo.pdf</A>

I've modified the current assignment, now due the coming Friday
(see above).
Instead of having you do the exercises from Chapter 3, I'm just
asking you to read it, and practice the programming techniques
introduced there.
Perhaps I haven't emphasized that the way to learn a programming language
is to play around with it.
You shouldn't expect to be able to do the Chapter 3 exercises right off
the bat,
unless you already know basic tricks of programming from
having programmed before in some other computer language.
The programming problems from RWEN are simpler and more directly relevant
to us, so let's concentrate on these.
Of course, if you have already done some or all of the Chapter 3 exercises,
that's great:
Be sure to include this in your journal!

How to learn German and French</A>
</H1>

<P>
A mathematician needs to be able to read, or at least
decipher, texts written in German and French, as these were
the standard languages of mathematical discourse from the early 
19th century through the beginning of the 20th century.
Before that, Latin prevailed, so it would be good to be able to
read Latin as well.
And Russian!!

<P>
One way to learn to read German or French is to learn to speak them.
For French, check out the free online video course `French in Action':

<BR><A NAME="tex2html30"
  HREF="http://www.learner.org/resources/series83.html">http://www.learner.org/resources/series83.html</A>
<BR>
This course proceeds slowly enough that you can likely learn French
just by watching the videos, which are free online.
Another good resource is the French Basic course
developed by the United States Foreign Service Institute,
which is available free online:

<BR><A NAME="tex2html31"
  HREF="http://fsi-language-courses.org/Content.php">http://fsi-language-courses.org/Content.php</A>
<BR>
This course has no video component, and it seems to blast right
off, so it would be best to watch `Franch in Action' first.

<P>
For German, I am sorry to see that the
the video course `Fokus Deutsch' is no longer freely available
as it was previously, though it's probably still out there somewhere.
I cannot personally vouch for the FSI German Basic Course, but
I think it would be a good bet.

<P>
Spanish is not so necessary for mathematics, but the online resources
for learning it are superb.
Foremost is the free video series `Destinos':

<BR><A NAME="tex2html32"
  HREF="http://www.learner.org/resources/series75.html">http://www.learner.org/resources/series75.html</A>
<BR>
And the FSI Spanish Basic course is great.
(Some people complain that it is boring, but they are wrong.)
Another fantastic resource is the ability to watch telenovelas online,
e.g. `Betty la Fea':

<BR><A NAME="tex2html33"
  HREF="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=6EF0917BD301C519">http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=6EF0917BD301C519</A>
<BR>
After that you'll be ready for `Don Quijote', which is a lot
better than you probably think if you've tried to read it in English
translation:

<B>Hints:</B>  The key step is to determine, for given state matrix <I>m</I> and row and column indices <I>a</I>, <I>b</I>, what the state should be at <I>a</I>, <I>b</I> next time.  
It will help to assume that (for an <I>n</I><SUB>1</SUB>-by-<I>n</I><SUB>2</SUB> matrix) 1 &lt; <I>a</I> &lt; <I>n</I><SUB>1</SUB> and 1 &lt; <I>b</I> &lt; <I>n</I><SUB>2</SUB>.
Then you just need some nested loops to fill in the new matrix <I>M</I>.
Set <I>m</I> = <I>M</I> and you're done.
Well, almost:  There will be problems at the border unless, before you do anything else, you make sure that the first and last two rows and columns are all 0.
if not, replace <I>m</I> with an (<I>n</I><SUB>1</SUB> + 4)-by-(<I>n</I><SUB>2</SUB> + 4) matrix, with the old <I>m</I> in the
middle.
Now put everything inside a loop where you display the grid (use <TT>image</TT>)
and pause briefly (use <TT>pause</TT>) after every step.
