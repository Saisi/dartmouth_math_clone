Calculus on Demand (COD) is an on-line version of a first calculus course. At Dartmouth, that course is called <em>Math 3, Introduction to Calculus</em>. COD contains lecture Web pages for the topics typically found in such a first course and in the College Board AP (AB) exam. 
<p>
You can use COD to learn calculus for the first time, or to review material that you have already studied. COD is flexible in that you can begin with Lecture 1 and proceed in order through the lectures, or you can check your understanding of the things you think you know and concentrate on the topics where you need more work. Before you go any further, click on the <a href="studentIntro.htm"><font color=blue>Letter to Students</font></a>, which explains how COD is organized and how to use it most effectively.
<p>
The lecture Web pages have been designed so that they can be used to study calculus with any textbook, although we specify a particular book so that we have something to refer to. If you already have a book, feel free to refer to it instead.
<p>
COD features the following on-line components, among others:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed examples with solutions.
<li>Video tutorials of problems being worked out step by step.
<li>Quizzes.
<li>Practice problems that tell you if you are right or wrong.
<li>Written solutions to the homework problems.
<li>Sample tests covering roughly the first third of the topics, the second third, and then comprehensive tests on the entire course.
<li>A bulletin board where you exchange information with other users of COD by posting comments or asking questions.
</ul>
<p>
We hope you enjoy using COD to study calculus on-line.
