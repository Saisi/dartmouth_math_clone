<h3>Quick Question</h3>
If we define f(x) = 1/x, is there any value of x for which f(x) = 0?

<h3>Answer</h3>
No. This is a case where a picture may be misleading. As x gets large through positive numbers, 1/x gets small. In fact, though it gets arbitrarily small, 1/x never equals 0. [Similar comments apply as x gets small through negative numbers (i.e., as x goes to the left).] Because of the limitations of computer screens and roundoff, it could appear that 1/x actually equals 0 if you go far enough to the right, but it never does.
