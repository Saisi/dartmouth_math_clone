<th align=left></a>Final Exam</th>
</table>
<p>
The final exam will be due in my office, 305 Kemeny Hall, between 10
am and 11 am on Monday, December 5th.  Please turn the exam in to me
personally!
<p>
Since the exam is closed book and closed notes, once you download the
exam you can only talk about the exam with your instructor.  No other
help, animate or inanimate, is allowed.
<p> 
The exam consists of 6 questions.  You should attempt all 6.
<p>
Please check this page periodically over the weekend in case there are
any clarifications or other information posted here.<ul>
    <li>On problem 3, the definition of a least common multiple is
    messed up (polite term).  It should say that c is the least common
    multiple of a and b if a divides c and b divides c, and if f is
    such that a
    divides f and b divides f, then c divides f.</li>
<li> On problem 5, you are to assume that alpha is a root of a <i>nonzero</i>
  polynomical (with rational coefficients). 
      </ul>
<p>
You can download the exam from this <a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~m71f11/xxx.pdf">link</a>.
Please let me know BEFORE FRIDAY AT 3:00PM if you have trouble with
this link.  The first page just consists of instructions (which you
should read!).  There are three pages all together.

<p>
The results on the midterm exam where generally good.  Below you'll
find a hist-o-gram of the scores on the second exam as well as some
terse solutions.  I have also provided a <b>very crude</b> estimate of
your grade to date based on the <i>total</i> of your first two exam
scores.  As usual, I did not address pluses and minues.

<th align=left></a>Midterm Exam</th>
</table>

<p>Our Midterm exam will be Thursday, November 3rd.  The exam will
  cover all material we've covered so far up and including Friday's
  lecture (October 28th).  (That means through section 4.5 on Sylow's
  Theorem.) 
<p>
The in-class exam will concentrate of definitions, statements of
results and straightforward applications.  The take-home will be
similar to homework problems.
<p>Both portions of the exam are closed book and closed notes.  You
  may of course ask me for clarification.

<th align=left></a>Preliminary Exam: Results</th>
</table>
<p>
The results on the preliminary exam were very good.  I have posted a
hist-o-gram of the scores.  (Recall that this exam was out of 75
points.)  I have also give a <b>very rough</b> estimate of the letter
grades.  This is bit silly since we just have the one data point, but
it might answer some questions.  I did not address "pluses and minuses".
<ul>
  <li>Here is the link to
  the <a href="exam1-dist.pdf">hist-o-gram</a>.</li>
  <li>A crude guide to letter grades:<ul>
      <li><b>A</b>: 65-75.</li>
      <li><b>B</b>: 50-65.</li>
      <li><b>C</b>: 40-50.</li>
        </ul>
</li>
    </ul>

<th align=left></a>Preliminary Exam</th>
</table>
<p>

Our first quiz or preliminary exam will be Thursday, October 13th.
The quiz will be in two parts.  The first part will be an in class
exam given during our x-hour.  The second part will be take home.  It
will passed out at the beginning of the x-hour and should be returned
Friday.   <i>(Instructions for turning in the take-home portion will be
given below.)</i>
</p>
<p>
The quiz will focus on material up to an including Friday's lecture on
October 7th.  That means through and including section 3.3 of the
text.  The in-class portion will concentrate on definitions and
theorems as well as some more "objective" questions.  The take-home
portion will involve a bit more work and should be similar to homework
exercises. 
</p>
<p>

<b>Turning in the exam</b>:  I will be out of town on Friday when the
take-home is due.  You may turn your exam in two ways.  The prefered
method is to turn it in to Professor Chernov in Kemeny 304 between
3:00 pm and 4:30 pm.  If you are not free during his office hours,
then you may turn it into our secretary, Ms. Kvam, in Kemeny 102A
between 10:00 am and 10:30 am.
