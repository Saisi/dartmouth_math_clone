Differential equations relate a function to some expression involving
its derivatives or partial derivatives. &nbsp;Any quantity that obeys
rules involving its various rates of change can be modeled with these
equations. &nbsp;These kinds of equations therefore occur throughout
the sciences, engineering, economics and medicine.<br>
<br>
There is one section of Math 23 this winter taught by
Professor Dorothy Wallace. &nbsp;It meets at the 11 hour-- MWF
11:15-12:20
and x-hour Tu 12-12:50. &nbsp;We will use the x-hour often, as
indicated on the syllabus. &nbsp;Wallace's office: Kemeny 204.
&nbsp;Office hours: Tu 1-2, W 4-5 except during department meetings, Th
9-10 and by appointment.<br>

<b> Required book</b>s: <span style="font-style: italic;">Notes on Diffy
Qs</span>, Lebl, course reader available at Wheelock Books. &nbsp;<span
style="font-style: italic;">Notes on Differential Equations,</span> Terrell,
free pdf file. <a
href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471433381.html"><i>Ele
mentary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems</i> </a>by Boyce and
DiPrima. &nbsp;You can use any addition, cheaply available through Amazon.
There's a <a
href="http://jws-edcv.wiley.com/college/bcs/redesign/student/0,,_0471433381_BKS_">
Student companion site</a> with reviews, quizzes, Matlab, etc,
by chapter.&nbsp; We will also make use of The <a
href="../~matc/eBookshelf/calculus/BigGreen.html">B
ig Green Ordinary Differential Equation Machine</a>&nbsp;
to assist with numerical solutions. &nbsp;Those who know Matlab are
encouraged to use it. There will also be a few research papers to read
and selections from Wikipedia as necessary.<br>
<p><b> Honor principle</b>. Exams: no help given or received. Homework:
<i>no copying</i>, however collaboration on approaches to problems is
encouraged. Write-ups must be done individually. Term paper:
discussion with others encouraged and paper to be written in pairs. &nbsp;You
and your partner must write it yourself
with proper citations. &nbsp;I encourage you to consult with a writing
editor (the College provides these through its writing programs).</p><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Attendance: &nbsp;</span>In
class we will frequently look at problems or issues not in the text.
&nbsp;You are responsible for everything done in class as well as what
is in the book.<p><b>Special needs</b>: Let me know if you have any, by the
first 2 weeks.
Also stop by the Academic Skills Center in 301 Collis to register for support
services.
</p>
<p><b>Private tutoring</b>: Tutor Clearinghouse may have private
one-on-one tutors available for Math 23. The tutors are recruited on
the basis that they have done well in the subject, and are trained by
the Academic Skills Center. If a student receives financial aid, the
College will pay for three hours of tutoring per week. If you would
like to have a tutor, please go to 301 Collis and fill out an
application asap.
</p>
<p><b>Religious observance</b>: Some students may wish to take part
in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you
have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in
the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of
the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.
