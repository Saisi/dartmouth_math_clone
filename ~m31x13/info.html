<p class="blocktext">Math 31 serves two purposes. The first is suggested by the course 
title: students should learn the basics of abstract algebra. This means that students 
should leave Math 31 with a solid understanding of various algebraic structures, 
specifically structures called <i>groups</i> and <i>rings</i>. In particular, we aim to 
address the following core questions:
</p>

<ul class="blocktext">
<li>What is a group? What are some fundamental examples of groups?</li>
<li>How can we tell when two groups are the same or different?</li>
<li>How can we analyze the structure of a group?</li>
<li>What is a ring? How do rings differ from groups?</li>
<li>How can we use abstract algebra to analyze polynomials and their roots?</li>
</ul>

<p class="blocktext">
The first three questions involve the study of structure and classification of groups. 
This will require students to become familiar with the concept of <i>isomorphism</i>. The 
last question leads to the beginnings of Galois theory (which is itself a beautiful branch 
of algebra). Along the way, we will emphasize the use of groups in the study of symmetries 
of mathematical objects. This will give a more concrete interpretation of algebra, and it 
will lend some insight into the origins of group theory.
</p>


<p class="blocktext">The second objective of Math 31 is much broader. En route to becoming 
well-versed in the ideas of modern algebra, students should learn to think like a modern 
mathematician. In particular, a course like this should help the students learn to read 
and write abstract mathematics. Both are very much acquired skills, and their development 
will be nurtured in the course. The most central skill to be developed will be the 
understanding of <i>mathematical proofs</i>. Students will need to learn how to read 
proofs, study how they are composed, and become proficient at constructing their own 
proofs. In addition, the students should learn to convey mathematical ideas clearly and 
correctly.</p>

</p>

<p class="blocktext">The course will progress tentatively as follows. We will begin with 
a historical overview and some motivating examples, and from there we will begin our study 
of group theory. This should take roughly the first half of the course, and it will end 
with the midterm exam. We will then spend two to three weeks on ring theory and 
polynomials. The course will end with some special topics and possibly applications of 
algebra, depending on the interests of the class. Class presentations will also take place 
in the last two weeks of the term. A more detailed schedule will be available on the 
<a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a> portion of the course webpage, and any updates to the 
course structure will appear there.
</p>

<p class="blocktext">Since the reading and writing of proofs is high on our list of 
objectives, many aspects of the course will be designed to develop these skills. For 
example, you will be strongly encouraged to read the textbook regularly. Also, the first 
two or three x-hours will be used as "workshops" for developing proof-writing skills. 
These will be purely for your benefit, and if you've already taken a proof-intensive 
class, you need not come regularly. After the first few weeks, we may continue the 
workshops as needed, or we might begin using the x-hours as problem sessions. 
Alternatively, we could use the x-hours to cover extra material and/or special topics.

I expect that you will attend class every day. Though it is not officially a part of the 
course grade, missing class could indirectly affect your performance through homework and 
exams. In particular, I will not always cover topics from the same perspective as the 
textbook, and we will even cover some things in class that are not mentioned in the book. 
Therefore, it would be best to attend class regularly. Additionally, a course like Math 31 
is intended to help you build mathematical maturity by learning to read and write proofs, 
and lectures and in-class discussion will help greatly with this.
</p>

<p class="blocktext">
On a side note, I will give suggested reading assignments after each class. I highly 
recommend that you look at them, since they will give you a preview of the next lecture, 
and they will help you become more comfortable with reading mathematics. I don't expect 
you to understand every single theorem and its proof on a first reading, but seeing the 
material ahead of time will likely help you to follow the next day's lecture.

<b>Exams:</b> Any exam labeled as in-class is closed book, with no notes or textbooks 
allowed. No help will be given or received. On take-home exams, collaboration is not 
permitted in any form, and no help will be given or received. The use of books and notes 
on take-home exams will be allowed at the instructor's discretion. Such sources will 
generally be limited to the course text(s) and your lecture notes. Electronic resources 
(i.e., the internet) will be forbidden.
</p>

<p class="blocktext">
<b>Homework:</b> You are welcome to discuss your homework with your classmates and the 
instructor, but the final result should be your own work. You are actually encouraged to 
collaborate with your classmates, but in the end you should always write up <i>your 
own</i> solutions. That is, you are free to discuss problems with each other and even work 
out ideas together, but you should write up your solutions by yourself. You should also 
credit the classmates with whom you worked when you write up your solutions. See the 
<a href="homework.html#collaboration"> homework page</a> for more details on 
collaboration. Also, you may not look up solutions to homework problems on the internet.
