<!-- Title of this page: Homework -->
<h1>Homework</h1>

<p class="alg">Homework will be assigned most weeks, for a total of 8 assignments. 
Assignments will usually be given on Wednesdays, due the following Wednesday at the 
beginning of class. Homework solutions should be written legibly in pen or pencil or 
typed. All proofs should be written in complete sentences. I reserve the right to reject 
any papers that are illegible. Also, please be sure to staple all papers before handing 
them in.
</p>

<p class="alg">The homework assignments will consist of both proofs and computational 
problems. Many of the problems will come from the textbook, but I may also take 
problems from other sources. The assignments will be divided into three sections 
corresponding to the difficulty of the problems:
</p>

<ul class="alg">
	<li>
	<b>Easy:</b> These are fairly basic problems that are intended to check your 
	understanding of the key concepts.
	</li>

	<br>
	<li>
	<b>Medium:</b> These are slightly more difficult problems that will require you to 
	apply the concepts you have learned to more interesting situations. The problems in 
	this range are of the type that you should expect to see on the exams.
	</li>

	<br>
	<li>
	<b>Hard:</b> These are fairly difficult problems. They will either require you to 
	explore certain concepts beyond what we have done in class, or the solutions may 
	involve some creativity.
	</li>
</ul>


<p class="alg">You will come to learn that an attempt at writing a mathematical proof 
either ends with a correct proof, or it does not. In other words, the solution to a proof 
question is either right or wrong. This idea will inform the grading of the homework 
problems to a certain extent. Each problem will be graded on a scale of 0 to 5, and the 
score will depend on both content and presentation. Roughly, the grading scheme will be as 
follows:
</p>

<ul class="alg">
	<li>
	<b>5:</b> Your solution is a correct proof of the given statement, and it is written 
	clearly, coherently, and in complete sentences.
	</li>

	<br>
	<li>
	<b>4:</b> The solution is mostly correct, but there are some small defects 
	that keep it from being an airtight argument. It is also written clearly and in 
	complete sentences.
	</li>

	<br>
	<li>
	<b>3:</b> The solution appears to be headed in the right direction, but there are 
	some fundamental flaws in the argument or in the exposition. In other words, a score 
	of 3 could result from a partially correct proof, or from cutting some corners in the 
	written presentation of your proof.
	</li>
	
	<br>
	<li>
	<b>2:</b> The proof is fundamentally flawed and/or not well-written.
	</li>
	
	<br>
	<li>
	<b>1:</b> The proof is incorrect or incoherent.
	</li>
	
	<br>
	<li>
	<b>0:</b> You did not make a reasonable attempt at solving the problem.
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="alg">
<a name="collaboration"><b>Notes on collaboration:</b></a> As noted in the honor statement 
for the course, I encourage you to talk to your classmates when working on the homework 
assignments. When learning abstract mathematics, it is often quite helpful to discuss 
ideas with others, and it can be easier to discern what one does and does not understand 
when trying to explain things to others. Therefore, collaboration is a valuable learning 
tool. However, you should keep the following guidelines in mind when working on homework.
</p>

<ul class="alg">
	<li>
	The solutions that you turn in to me should be written up by you in your own words. 
	It is fine to discuss ideas with others, but I want each person to think individually 
	about how to put those ideas down on paper.
	</li>

	<br>
	<li>
	If you have worked with others on a particular problem, say so when you write up the 
	solution. If you got a particular idea from someone else, give them the appropriate 
	credit.
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="alg">
In summary, I encourage you to work on homework together, and to possibly work out ideas 
in groups. However, I do not want you to write up complete proofs as a group&mdash;this 
should be done individually. Look <a href="collaboration.html">here</a> for examples of 
what I think are acceptable levels of collaboration.
