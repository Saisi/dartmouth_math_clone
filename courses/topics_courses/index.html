<h1>Topics and Graduate Course Descriptions</h1>
<br clear="all" />

<h2>Spring 2014</h2>

<ul>
<li><h3>Math 116: Applied Mathematics - Great Papers in Numerical Analysis (Alex Barnett)</h3>
<p>
Prereqs: programming (eg CS1 or Math26), Math 63, Math 23, Math 22/24.
Graduate analysis (73/103) will help.
<p><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('m116s14')" title="Show/hide course description">Description</a></p>
<div id="m116s14" style="display:none;">
<p>
We will overview key background in numerical analysis and computation, and
then students, with instructor help, will read and present from a set of a
dozen or so classic influential papers that have shaped modern numerical
methods. The course will include coding up some of the algorithms discussed.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Winter 2014</h2>

<ul>
<li><h3>Math 128: Current Problems in Symmetric Functions (Rosa Orellana)</h3>
<p>Prerequisite:  An algebra course ( e.g., M71 or M101)  and a basic combinatorics course 
(M28) as well as a desire to learn and solve problems.  If you have not had a course in 
combinatorics and would like to take the course, talk to Rosa.</p>
<p><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('m128w14')" title="Show/hide course description">Description</a></p>
<div id="m128w14" style="display:none;">
<p>The first 2&ndash;3 weeks will be a crash course on symmetric functions.   Then we will spend the rest of the term surveying open problems related to Kostka numbers, Littlewood-Richardson coefficients and Kronecker coefficients.   We will also survey the literature for recent results in the area. 
</p>
<p>Students will learn how to use SAGE to generate data and look for patterns in the data. We will make conjectures and work on them throughout the term and beyond if there is enough interest. 
</p>
<p>Homework:  Students will be expected to write simple programs and read articles and present them to the class. There will be no exams.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<h3>Math 123: Geometry and Quantization (Erik Van Erp)</h3>
<p><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('m123w14')" title="Show/hide course description">Description</a></p>
<div id="m123w14" style="display:none;">
<p>I will start with explaining the formalism of Hamiltonian mechanics. First we develop it in Euclidean space, and then generalize to the setting of symplectic manifolds. We study Hamiltonian flow, Poisson brackets, moment maps, Darboux&apos;s theorem, and perhaps Noether&apos;s theorem on the relation between symmetry and conservation laws. We then discuss the relation between Hamiltonian mechanics and quantum mechanics, and study mathematically precise ways in which classical mechanics is a limit of quantum mechanics (the &ldquo;correspondence principle&rdquo;). We then cover various topics from geometric quantization theory, and/or contact topology, depending on time and interest.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<h3>SPECIAL TOPICS COURSE: Homogeneous Ricci flow and solitons</h3>
<p>Instructor: Jorge Lauret (visiting from University of Cordoba, Argentina). Preparation lectures: Carolyn Gordon</p>
<p>Prerequisite: Differential topology. Students should have had some exposure to Riemannian geometry. However, if you are interested in the course and have not had a course in Riemannian geometry, we can include an introduction in January.   Please discuss your background in advance with Carolyn Gordon.
</p>
<p><a href="javascript:toggleDiv('stcw14')" title="Show/hide course description">Description</a></p>
<div id="stcw14" style="display:none;">
<p>The Ricci flow on Riemannian manifolds has been a subject of intense activity in recent years, especially since it played a central role in the solution of the Poincare Conjecture.   Jorge Lauret has done groundbreaking working on Ricci flow and Ricci solitons in the setting of homogeneous spaces.   
</p>
<p>Lauret will give twelve 90-minute lectures during the month of February.   The first six lectures will address flows on homogeneous spaces, in particular, the Ricci flow.   The second half of the lecture series will address homogeneous Ricci solitons; these are metrics that essentially remain stable under the Ricci flow.   
</p>
<p>In preparation for Lauret&apos;s lectures, we will hold regular 65-minute classes in January to address background material on Lie groups and homogeneous spaces.   The exact content of the January lectures will depend on the backgrounds of the students.
</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Spring 2013</h2>

<ul>
<li><h3>Math 17:  Imaginary numbers are real!  Complex numbers are simple! (Doyle)</h3>
<p>We will survey the role of complex numbers across the mathematical
spectrum, from the central limit theorem of probability, to the
distribution of prime numbers, to hyperbolic geometry, to the
mathematical apparatus of quantum mechanics.</p>
</li>

<li><h3>Math 102: Topics in Geometry (Doyle)</h3>
<!--p>Prerequisites: </p-->
<p>
 <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('m102s13')" title="Show/hide course description">Description</a>
<div id="m102s13" style="display:none;"><p>This course will be a general introduction to Fuchsian groups, with
emphasis on spectral geometry and arithmetic groups.  The subject of
Fuchsian groups lies at the intersection between geometry, topology,
algebra, number theory, and analysis, so it should be of interest to a
wide range of graduate students, including first-year students.  The
course should also be accessible to undergraduates who have taken Math
63 and 81 (or in exceptional case,  63 and 71). </p>

<p>The primary course text will be Svetlana&apos;s Katok&apos;s book &lsquo;Fuchsian
groups&rsquo;. A good part of the course will be devoted to developing the
techniques to compute explicit examples, using Mathematica, Sage, and
Magma.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><h3>Math 118: Topics in Combinatorics (Elizalde)</h3>
<p>Prerequisites: An "advanced" undergraduate combinatorics course</p>
<p>
 <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('m118s13')" title="Show/hide course description">Description</a>
<div id="m118s13" style="display:none;"><p>I&apos;ve chosen topics that I haven&apos;t covered in my more recent graduate
courses, so they should be mostly new for everyone. Possible topics
include sieve methods (Gessel-Viennot formula, involutions),
partitions (Euler, Jacobi and Rogers-Ramanujan identities),
P-partitions, partially ordered sets, plane partitions, tilings,
reduced decompositions of permutations, parking functions, and an
introduction to polytopes (Dehn-Somerville equations, associahedron,
permutahedron).First paragraph </p>
</div>
</li>

<li><h3>Math 125: Quadratic forms and spaces (Shemanske)</h3>
<p>Prerequisites: Everyone should have adequate algebra by
spring, and while it would be nice to be acquainted with number fields
and their (p-adic) completions, the essentials can be picked up with
reasonable ease.
</p>
<p>
 <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('m125s13')" title="Show/hide course description">Description</a>
<div id="m125s13" style="display:none;"><p>In the mid 1930&apos;s Witt dramatically changed the perspective by which
mathematicians viewed the theory of quadratic forms, from a study of
homogeneous polynomials of degree 2 to the study of vector spaces
endowed with a symmetric bilinear form.  The theory then became one of
determining canonical decompositions and of classification of these
spaces in terms of arithmetic invariants.
</p>
<p>The course will be distinctly algebraic in flavor, and in general we
will be interested in the theory over number fields and Dedekind
rings, meaning the focus will also be influenced by questions in
algebraic number theory.
</p>
</div>
</li>

</ul> <!-- End of term --> 

<h2>Winter 2013</h2>

<ul>

<li><h3>Math 100: Topics in Probability [Random Walk on a Graph]  (Winkler)</h3>
<p>Prerequisites: Basic probability (e.g. Math 20 or 60), and some
experience with proofs; graph theory or combinatorics will be useful
but not necessary.  Graduate students at all levels in math and in
computer science are welcome, as are advanced undergrad majors.</p>
<p>
 <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('m100w13')" title="Show/hide course description">Description</a>
<div id="m100w13" style="display:none;"><p>When a token moves randomly from vertex to vertex via the edges of a
graph, it is taking a random walk.  This simple process is as useful
as it is elegant, with multiple analogies in electrical networks
(cf. Doyle and
Snell&apos;s <a href='../../~doyle/docs/walks/walks.pdf'>
Random Walks and Electrical Networks </a>, which will be one of our
sources) and applications to the theory of computing.  There have been
remarkable new advances in this now-classical subject and we will
spend much time with recent work and unsolved problems. </p>
</div>
</li>

<li><h3>Math 112: Topics in Geometry [Introduction to Riemannian Geometry]  (Sutton)</h3>
<!--p>Prerequisites: </p-->
<p>
 <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('m112w13')" title="Show/hide course description">Description</a>
<div id="m112w13" style="display:none;"><p> Manifolds are one way in which mathematicians deal with the concept
 of "space," and the presence of a Riemannian metric on a manifold
 provides us with a framework and a set of tools with which we may
 explore the geometric and topological nature of the space in
 question. Among the tools available to us, curvature is perhaps the
 most fundamental. The three primary flavors of curvature are
 sectional curvature, Ricci curvature and scalar curvature, and each
 provides us with a local characterization of how much a given space
 deviates from being Euclidean. After laying the basic foundations of
 Riemannian geometry, one of our main objectives will be to examine
 how (global) constraints on curvature influence the topological and
 geometric structure of the space. In particular, we will prove the
 topological sphere theorem and---as time and interest permits---we
 will discuss the differentiable sphere theorem of Brendle and Schoen
 from 2009. </p>
<p>Topics: connections, Riemannian metrics, volume, curvature and
isometries; geodesics, Jacobi fields, the energy functional, first &
second variations of energy; spaces of constant curvature; (locally)
symmetric spaces; isoperimetirc inequalities; spectral geometry;
sphere theorems.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><h3>Math 126: Topics in Applied Mathematics (Gillman)</h3>
<p>Prerequisites: Graduate students at all levels in math and in computer 
science are welcome, as are advanced undergrad majors who have taken Math 23.<br />
Suggested background: Some coding experience (Matlab, Fortran, or C), Math 46, Math 63</p>
<p>
 <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('m126w13')" title="Show/hide course description">Description</a>
<div id="m126w13" style="display:none;"><p>Partial differential equations (PDEs) are essential for the modelling of
physical phenomena appearing in a variety of fields from geophysics and fluid dynamics to
geometry.  In this course, we will study three major topics one should 
understand when modelling with PDEs.  The topics are: 
<br><br>
(i) the theory (e.g. existence and uniqueness of solutions)><br>
(ii) when and how can solutions be found analytically><br />
(iii) classic numerical techniques (e.g. finite difference and finite element methods) and how
to determine if the method is stable and convergent.</p>
<p>In addition, we will discuss the limitations of existing solution techniques in the 
context of open research questions.</p>
</div>
</li>

</ul> <!-- End of term --> 

<h2>Fall 2012</h2>

<ul>

<li><h3>Math 105: Topics in Number Theory (Pomerance)</h3>
<p>Prerequisites: A knowledge of elementary number theory and some
  abstract algebra.</p>
<p>This class has been scheduled for the 10A period.</p>
<p>
 <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('m105f12')" title="Show/hide course description">Description</a>
<div id="m105f12" style="display:none;"><p>This course will be an introduction to Diophantine Equations and
Diophantine Approximation.  The first topic involves determining if a
polynomial equation in several variables has any integer or rational
solutions, and if it does, how to find them. The second topic refers
to the approximation of real numbers with rational numbers. We shall
see that the two topics are closely intertwined.  Some of the more
specific topics will be the Pell equation (quadratic in two variables)
and the Thue equation (a homogeneous polynomial in two variables equal
to a constant).  We shall see how to prove that e and pi are
transcendental numbers, and we&apos;ll discuss some other pretty
constants. </p>
<p>We will start out using the book <i>Lecture notes on Diophantine
analysis</i> by Umberto Zannier.  This book is available from
amazon.com for about $30 including shipping, but I&apos;m not sure how
robust the supply is.  It would be good to order a copy soon. Partway
into the term we&apos;ll branch out using some other material, which I&apos;ll
make available.</p>
<p>There will be some written homework assignments, and students will
be expected to occasionally present topics to the class, possibly a
homework solution or a new topic.  There will be no formal
examinations.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><h3>Math 109: Topics in Logic (Groszek)</h3>
<p>Prerequisites: no prerequisites for graduate students.</p>
<p>
 <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('m109f12')" title="Show/hide course description">Description</a>
<div id="m109f12" style="display:none;"><p>The course will be on the general topic of mathematical logic and
arithmetic.  Depending on the interests of the students, we will begin
with a discussion of Godel&apos;s Incompleteness Theorem, and then move on
to reverse mathematics (using logic to analyze the relative strength
of theorems of classical mathematics), nonstandard analysis (calculus
with infinitesimals), the unsolvability of Hilbert&apos;s Tenth Problem
(maybe my favorite choice), or a related topic of interest.
</p>
<p>For students who have begun thesis work in another area, attendance
will be the major part of the grade. Students who are (possibly) preparing 
for a logic qual should talk to me about targeted homework assignments.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Spring 2012</h2>

<ul>
<li><h3>Math 121: Current problems in algebra (Webb)</h3></li>

<li><h3>Math 125: Reflection and Coxeter groups; Buildings and Classical
  Groups (Shemanske)</h3>
<p>Prerequisites: 101, 111 (suitable for first year students).<br />
Any number theory needed (not much) will be developed.</p>
<p>
 <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('m125s12')" title="Show/hide course description">Details</a>
<div id="m125s12" style="display:none;"><p>This is bits of algebra, geometry, topology and a little combinatorics
  all rolled into one course.
The goal is to say something about the theory of buildings, with
  slightly more interest in their combinatorial/topological structure
  and number theoretic applications than their original purpose, which
  was to understand the structure and classify classical p-adic groups
  (using the building as a representation space), in analogy to
  semi-simple Lie theory.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><h3>Math 128: Topics in Combinatorics (Elizalde)</h3>
<p>Prerequisites: Math 118.  If you have had an advanced undergraduate
  course in combinatorics and are interested, talk to Sergi about your
  preparation.</p>
<p>
 <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('m128s12')" title="Show/hide course description">Details</a>
<div id="m128s12" style="display:none;"><p>The course will cover pattern-avoiding permutations, permutations in
  dynamical systems, bijections, counting methods, generating trees,
  and perhaps asymptotic analysis of generating functions, among other
  topics to be decided.</p></div></li>

<h2>Winter 2012</h2>

<ul>

<li><h3>Math 17: An Introduction to Mathematics Beyond Calculus (Shemanske)</h3>
<p>Prerequisite: Math 8, or placment into Math 11.</p>
<p>Details: This year&apos;s offering will be 
&ldquo;From Caculus to Elliptic Curve Cryptography in ten weeks&rdquo;<br>
See the <a href="../../~m17w12/index.html">web site</a>. 
</p>
</li>

<li><h3>Math 89: Set theory (Weber)</h3>
<p>Prerequisite: Math 39 or Math 69 or familiarity with the language of
  first-order logic and readiness for an upper level math
  course.</p>
<p>
 <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('m89w12')" title="Show/hide course description">Details</a>
<div id="m89w12" style="display:none;"><p>Math 89 satisfies the culminating experience requirement for
  mathematics majors, and is appropriate for any graduate student who
  wants to take a course in logic and doesn&apos;t yet know a lot of set
  theory. </p>
<p>We will study the axioms of set theory, what they tell us about the
  universe of sets, and how we can use the universe of sets to study
  the universe of mathematics.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><h3>Math 112: Geometry (Gordon)</h3>
<p>Prerequisite: A course in differential topology, including vector
fields and their flows.  (The course that used to be called Math 124
and is called Math 102 this fall is ideal.)</p>
<p>
 <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('m112w12')" title="Show/hide course description">Details</a>
<div id="m112w12" style="display:none;"><p>Lie groups and Lie algebras are ubiquitous throughout mathematics,
e.g. in geometry, number theory, combinatorics, analysis and dynamics.
The first part of the course will address the basic notions and
results elucidating the Lie group -- Lie algebra correspondence.  We
will then introduce various types of Lie groups and Lie algebras
(semisimple, solvable, nilpotent, compact).  There are various
directions that we could pursue after that, depending on time and the
interests of the class.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><h3>Math 122: The Atiyah-Singer index theorem and the heat kernel
  proof (van Erp)</h3>
<p>Prerequisites: the introductory graduate level analysis and topology
  sequences (103/113, 124/114).</p>
</li>

<li><h3>Math 126: Numerical analysis for PDEs and wave scattering
  (Barnett)</h3>
<p>Prerequisite: some programming experience (preferred: Matlab/octave,
  C, or fortran; esp. the first).</p>
<p>Recommended background: some PDEs (could be at undergrad level, eg
  Math 46) and real analysis (Math 63 and some graduate-level
  functional analysis). However the background is flexible: a
  motivated advanced undergrad or other science/engineering/CS student
  (undergrad or grad) could pick up enough to learn a lot and do
  well.</p>
<p>
 <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('m126w12')" title="Show/hide course description">Details</a>
<div id="m126w12" style="display:none;"><p>This will cover modern integral-equation-based methods for solving
  piecewise-constant coefficient PDEs (focusing on those arising in
  electrostatics and time-harmonic waves), including the theory,
  analysis, and coding experience required for proficiency. Much
  content will overlap with previous Math 116&apos;s offered by
  Barnett.</p>
<p>We start with an introduction to numerical analysis, conditioning and
  stability, numerical interpolation and integration, followed by
  potential theory, Laplace&apos;s equation and Helmholtz equation. The
  latter leads to scattering problems, a flavor of fast algorithms
  (FFT, fast multipole), and final projects. Homework will be
  dominated by coding and implementing the algorithms, but also
  include some proofs. Projects can be coding-based or a deeper study
  of numerical analysis results.</p>
</div>
</li>

</ul>


<h2>Fall 2011</h2>

<ul>

<li><h3>Math 102: Foundations of Smooth Manifolds (Sutton)</h3>
<p>Prerequisites: Linear algebra (Math 24), point-set topology (math 54)
and multivariable analysis (Math 73). It will also help to be familiar
with covering spaces and the fundamental group.
</p>
<p>
 <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('m102f11')" title="Show/hide course description">Description</a>
<div id="m102f11" style="display:none;"><p>Manifolds provide mathematicians and other scientists
with a way of grappling with the concept of "space." The space
occupied by an object. The space that we inhabit. Or, perhaps, the
space of configurations of a mechanical system. While manifolds are
center stage in the study of geometry and topology, they also provide
an appropriate framework in which to explore aspects of mathematical
physics, dynamics, control theory, medical imaging, econometrics and
robotics, to name just a few. This course will serve as an
introduction to the basics of manifold theory and lay the foundations
needed to explore problems in which "space" plays a fundamental
role. 
</p>
<p>Topics will include some of the following: manifolds & tangent
bundles; vector fields & vector bundles; smooth maps and the inverse
function theorem; cotangent bundle & differential forms; densities,
integration on manifolds and the generalized theorem of Stokes;
Whitney&apos;s imbedding theorem; Lie groups, group actions & homogeneous
spaces; Tensor Fields & Riemannian metrics; Differential forms &
orientation; integral curves & the existence and uniqueness theorem
for ODEs; Distributions and Frobenius&apos; Theorem.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><h3>Math 105: Primes and polynomials (Pomerance)</h3>
<p>Prerequisites:  An undergrad number theory course, as well as some
  abstract algebra.  I&apos;ll be happy to try and fill in gaps for
  motivated students.</p>
<p>
 <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('m105f11')" title="Show/hide course description">Description/Grading</a>
<div id="m105f11" style="display:none;"><p>This course will develop elementary estimates on the distribution of
  prime numbers, including elementary sieve methods.  A recurrent
  theme will be the prime factorization of integer-polynomial values.
  We will follow the first 3 chapters of Pollack&apos;s "Not always buried
  deep", as well as Chapter 6, and also Chapter 3 of Montgomery &
  Vaughan&apos;s "Multiplicative number theory".  I recommend acquiring
  Pollack&apos;s book, the second book is optional.</p>
<p>Grading:  There will be weekly written assignments, plus some class
  presentations.  There will be no formal exams.  Enrolled graduate
  students who have been admitted to candidacy will be excused from
  the written assignments.</p></div></li>

<li><h3>Math 108: Combinatorial Representation Theory (Orellana)</h3>
<p>Prerequisites: Linear algebra and algebra (Math 31, 71, or 101).  No
  prior knowledge of combinatorics or representation theory is
  expected.</p>
<p>
 <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('m108f11')" title="Show/hide course description">Details</a>
<div id="m108f11" style="display:none;"><p>This is an introduction to algebraic combinatorics, specifically
  symmetric function theory and its connections to representation
  theory, algebraic geometry, and tableaux
  combinatorics.<br />
