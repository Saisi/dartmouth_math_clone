The underlying theme ofthe course is an examination of the notion of representing reality and thefundamental role in this process played by mathematics throughout the history ofWestern civilization, right up to the present day. Intended for students whosemajor interests are outside mathematics and the sciences, the course assumes thatstudents have only a background in high school mathematics. By consideringspecific examples, we will learn to express in the language of mathematics a substantial number of our everyday experiences. We will see that mathematics,especially through mathematical algorithms, is everywhere, whether it be in ISBN book codes or in the swing of a pendulum.</P><P>&nbsp;<P>&nbsp;<P>&nbsp;<P>&nbsp;<SMALL> Copyright &copy; 2010 by C.
