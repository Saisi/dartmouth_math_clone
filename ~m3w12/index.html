<b>Professor:</b> <a href="../~zdaugherty/index.html">Zajj Daugherty</a> <br>
<b>Office hours:</b> 314 Kemeny, 11-12 MThF<br>

<b>Class:</b> MWF 10a-11:05a, X-Hour Th 12:00-12:50, in 008 Kemeny Hall


<p>

<b>Required book</b><br>
The manuscript <i>Principles of Calculus Modeling: An Interactive Approach</i>, by Donald Kreider, Dwight Lahr, and Susan Diesel, is available at <A HREF="http://www.wheelockbooks.com/"> Wheelock Books </A> Books . Each section of the book has a companion page on the Web which can be accessed at the <a href="../~klbooksite/index.html">KLDbook site</a>. 
<p>



<b>Homework</b><br>
You will get and turn in all Math 3 homework using the online tool <a href="../~m3cod/webworklogin.htm">WeBWorK</a>. Homework due-dates will be shown on the WeBWorK assignments, which will generally be due at 10:00 a.m. on the second class day after the class in which the material is covered. Answers will be available at 1:00 p.m. on the same day. Late homework will not be accepted without advance permission from your instructor, obtained well before the assignment is due. There will normally be at least one class-day between the day homework is assigned and the day it is due, thereby providing plenty of opportunity for you to get your questions answered. 


<p>
<b>Exams</b><br> 
<ol>
    Midterm 1: Mon 1/30, 3:30-4:45pm<br>

Each of the midterm exams will consist of two parts--a multiple-choice part and a non multiple-choice part where partial credit can be earned. The final exam will be entirely multiple-choice. No calculators, computers, or other electronic devices will be needed or allowed in these sit-down exams. Be sure to take #2 pencils to mark the scantron forms. 

<p>

<b>Grades</b><br>
15% - homework<br>
25% - Midterm 1<br>
25% - Midterm 2<br>
35% - Final<br><p>

<b>Honor principle</b><br>
On the two hour-exams and the final examination you will work individually, guided by the Dartmouth Academic Honor Principle. On the daily homework exercises, you will each have different numbers and you will turn in assignments individually, although you are encouraged to work collaboratively. Collaboration though does not include copying someone else's work--a clear violation of the Honor Principle. Feel free to talk with other students about the material. You may even decide to form a study group for that purpose. You also may seek assistance from a tutor or your instructor(s). When it comes to writing up the homework, however, you should do this by yourself without outside assistance. In this regard, it is a violation of the Honor Principle to share electronic files, or to type answers into someone else's WeBWorK account. 


<p><b>Tutorials</b><br>
Our graduate teaching assistants will run tutorials, <b>Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday nights from 7-9pm in 105 Kemeny</b>, focusing on working through problems. Please bring questions you are stuck on! Your TA is: Nicolas Petit
<p>

<b>Private tutoring</b><br> 
Tutor Clearinghouse may have private one-on-one tutors available for Math 11. The tutors are recruited on the basis that they have done well in the subject, and are trained by the Academic Skills Center. If a student receives financial aid, the College will pay for three hours of tutoring per week. If you would like to have a tutor, please go to 301 Collis and apply as early as possible. For more information check the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/tutors/index.html">academic skills center site</a>.
<p>


<b>Special needs</b><br> 
I encourage students with disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities like chronic diseases and learning disabilities, to discuss with us any appropriate accommodations that might be helpful. Let me know asap, certainly in first 2 weeks. Also stop by the Academic Skills Center in 301 Collis to register for support services, or call ext. 6-2014.


<p>

<b>Religious observance</b><br>
 Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.

<p>

<B>Serious Illness</B><br>
If you contract a flu or other serious illness, please contact your professor by email.  We will be happy to make arrangements for you to make up late work, or exams if you provide us with a note from Dick's house.  Please do not come to class if you have an influenza-like illness. The Math 3 website contains the complete class schedule, so you will know what you've missed and how to keep up.  For more information on what to do if you believe you have the flu, see the <A HREF="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~prepare/common_hazards/influenza_and_illness.html">Dartmouth web page </A>devoted to this topic.
