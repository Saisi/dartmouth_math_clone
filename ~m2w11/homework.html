<p>
Written homework assignments and reading assignments will be posted on this page.  
<p>

<b>Written Homework:</b>  The first written assignment will be assigned Friday, January 7 and will be due <b>Thursday, January 13 by 10 AM</b>.  The second written assignment will be assigned 
Wednesday, January 12 and will be due Wednesday, January 19.  All subsequent written assignments will be due on Mondays. 


<p>

<b>Written Homework Policy:</b>
<ul>

<li>Late homework will be collected and corrected, but will receive a score of 0. </li><br />

<li>Homework is to be written <b>neatly</b> using 8 1/2 x 11 inch
paper. <b>Do not</b> use paper from a spiral notebook unless you can tear off
the ragged edge. All papers are to be <b>stapled.</b></li><br />

<li> <b> Show your work. </b> It is not your instructor's job to decipher what you mean by the symbols on the page; rather, it is your 
job to explain your work clearly enough to convey your understanding of the material to your instructor.  A good rule of thumb: Explain and 
justify your steps as if the person reading your homework were another student, taking the same course, who had missed the last week of class.


<li><b>Use English.</b>  If you can't read your solutions aloud as fluently as
  if you were reading your textbook, try using nouns and verbs in your
  write ups!</li><br />

<li>Consult the <a href="info.html">honor principle</a> as it applies to this course. </li>
</ul>

      <th> Extra Credit </th></tr></tbody></table>

<br>

Successful completion of the <a href="extracredit.pdf">Extra Credit assignment</a> (a 3-page paper about an aspect of either the history or the applications of calculus) will change your lowest homework score to a 100%.  You must meet with your instructor to choose a topic for the Extra Credit assignment by <i><b>Friday, February 25</b></i>; the paper must be turned in before the final exam, on Saturday, March 12.
