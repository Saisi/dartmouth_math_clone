			<ul>
				<li>Homework will consist of several problems from the textbook which will be assigned weekly.  They are to be handed in before class on the day they are due; they will be returned to the homework boxes outside of your classroom in Kemeny.  In general, late homework will not be accepted for a grade, and never without prior arrangement.  Illness and family emergency are the two main reasons why an extension on homework may be granted.
				</li>   
				<br>
				<li> Homework assignments will be graded much as the problems on your exams will be graded, that is the graders will be looking at the work which supports your answer even more than the answer itself. In particular, a correct answer with no justification will receive no credit, whereas mostly correct work and a tiny error may receive a substantial amount of credit.  Solutions should be written in an organized and legible manner.  The purpose here is to prepare you for how your exams will be graded.
				</li> 
				<br>
				<li> The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student's education records as well as providing a considerable amount of privacy concerning their academic status and grades.  As such, we cannot return graded written homework assignments in a public fashion (such as in a pile on a desk or in homework boxes outside 008 Kemeny) unless you sign a waiver forfeiting your rights to privacy for grades on your written homework assignments.  These waivers will be distributed on the first day of class, and whether you sign them or not will have no impact on your performance in this class.  If you choose not to sign a FERPA waiver, you will need to visit your instructor's office to pick up your homework assignment there, and may need to present your student ID if your instructor insists on verifying your identity.  The waiver does not apply to exams, which will be returned in a private fashion. Waivers may be signed at any time after the first day of class.  If you did not pick one up in class, they are available <a href="FERPA-m10s12.pdf">here</a>.
				</li>  
				<br>
				<li>Consult the honor principle (below) as it applies to this course. </li>
				</ul>
		</div>		

	

		<div class="fullCol">
			<div class="separator">Honor Principle</div>
				<p><b>On Exams:</b> All exams are closed book, and no help is to be given or received. No calculators, computers, cell phones, or other electronic aids are allowed.
				</p>

				<p><b>On Homework:</b>Collaboration is permitted and encouraged - a discussion of the general idea of homework problems with instructors, tutors, fellow students and others is desirable. However, each student is expected to complete his or her assignments individually and independently. Computing devices are allowed on homework, although they will not be necessary. As a general rule of thumb, you should understand why the solution you write down is correct, and should write the actual solution up on your own.</p>

				<p>If you have any questions as to whether some action would be acceptable under the Academic Honor Code, please speak to your instructor, and we will be glad to help clarify things. It is always easier to ask beforehand.</p>

		<div class="fullCol">
			<div class="separator">Disabilities</div>
			<p> We encourage any students with disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities such as chronic diseases and learning disabilities, to discuss appropriate accommodations with your instructor, which might help you with this class, either after class or during office hours. Dartmouth College has an active program to help students with disabilities, and we are happy to do whatever we can to help out, as appropriate.</p>

			<p>Any student with a documented disability requiring academic adjustments or accommodations is requested to speak with their instructor by the end of the second week of the term. All discussions will remain confidential, although the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/"> Academic Skills Center</a>  may be consulted to verify the documentation of the disability and advise on an appropriate response to the need. It is important, however, that you talk to us soon, so that we can make whatever arrangements might be needed in a timely fashion.</p>

			<p>Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term.  If you have a religious observance
that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with us before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.</p>
