<center>
<p align="left" style="width:80%">There will be two exams in this course: one midterm exam and a final exam. The two exams will have slightly different formats.
</p>

<p align="left" style="width:80%"><b>Midterm:</b> The midterm will be divided into two parts - an in-class portion and a take-home portion.
</p>
</center>
</div>

<div id="content">
<ul align="left">
<li>The in-class part will be designed to test basic concepts, such as statements of definitions and theorems. There will also be some fairly basic proof questions. This part of the exam will be <i>closed-book</i>. As an indicator of the level of difficulty for the proof questions, I will hand out a list of practice questions in advance of the exam. These questions should give you an idea of the sorts of things that I expect you to be able to prove on your own. The exam questions will not necessarily come from the practice list, but they will be of the same level of difficulty.</li>

<br>

<li>The take-home portion will be open-book. This means that you may use the course text (Herstein), the reserve text (Gallian), your lecture notes, and old homework assignments. Other textbooks and physical materials are off limits, as are any electronic sources (i.e., the internet). Also, you are not allowed to collaborate with one another, and you should not expect help from me, other than clarification of questions. The questions will mostly ask you to prove things that are slightly more difficult than the questions asked on the in-class exam. There may also be some computational questions. This part of the exam will be due a few days after the in-class exam.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>

<p align="left" style="width:80%"><b>Final:</b>
The final exam will be entirely take-home. The same rules given for the take-home midterm will apply here. The exam will be handed out in the last few days of class and will be due during the final exam period.
</p>

<p align="left" style="width:80%">
The dates for the two exams are as follows:

<li>The in-class midterm will be held on <b>Monday, July 23rd in our usual class period</b>. The take-home part will be handed out at the end of the in-class exam, <b>due Friday, July 27th at the beginning of class</b>.

Here are some review materials for the midterm: <a href="Midterm%20Review.pdf">Midterm Review.pdf</a>. Included is a list of topics, as well as sample proof questions for the in-class exam.

<li>The take-home final will be handed out on the last day of class (August 22). It will be <b>due by noon on Monday, August 27th</b>.
