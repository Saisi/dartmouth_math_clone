<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Drawing Conclusions About a Proportion</H1>


This interactive program is designed to illustrate some of the key
ideas behind hypothesis testing, a procedure for incorporating
uncertainty about data into a formal decision making process.

<P>
Consider the following example. Medical investigators in a developing
country are considering using a live vaccine for HIV infection. The
risks of this procedure are considerable, but a high prevalence of the
disease in their population would justify the intervention.  For
instance, if only 10% of the population were infected, the number of
complications from the vaccine would exceed the number of infections
prevented.  However, if the prevalence were as high as 30%, the
distribution of the vaccine would be justified.

<P>
The investigators know something about the prevalence of HIV in this
country, and they think that there is only a one-in-five chance that
10% of the population is infected.

<P>
To test their "null" hypothesis of a low, 10% prevalence versus their
"alternative" hypothesis of a 30% prevalence, they conduct a random
survey of 20 individuals, and measure their HIV status. They then
compute the proportion of the infected persons in the sample.

<P>
To test their hypothesis, they compute something called a "p-value"
based on the known distribution of the proportion under the "null"
hypothesis. When this number is small, the "null" hypothesis is
unlikely to be true. Typically, investigators require that the p-value
be less than .05 to choose the alternative hypothesis over the null
hypothesis.

<P>
By pressing the "Generate Data" button, you can see how the p-value is
calculated from the tail area of the null distribution of the
proportion.  You can choose to generate data under the null or
alternative hypothesis, to see how well the p-value discriminates
between the two scenarios.

<P>
In the above scenario, the investigators suspected that 10% prevalence
is less likely before conducting their survey.  They could formally
incorporate this belief into their decision making process.  The data
from the survey is used to revise their "prior" probabilities for the
two scenarios.  The revised ("posterior") probabilities are used to
decide whether 10% or 30% of the population is infected.  The program
illustrates how this procedure of probability revision is done.
