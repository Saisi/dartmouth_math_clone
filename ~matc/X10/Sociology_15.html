<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Course Description:</STRONG></FONT> <BR> 
This course introduces students to the quantitative tools of
data analysis in the social sciences.  The course covers the conceptual and
applied aspects of the research process, secondary data and its limitations, as
well as the basic statistics of quantitative analysis.  Topics  include deriving
hypotheses from theories and conceptual models, operationalizing concepts,
experimental and quasi-experimental designs, sampling, data management, and
statistical analysis.  The emphasis of the course is on the application of
quantitative research methods to sociological issues.  Students will learn how to
design and implement research projects using the 1990 U.S. Census of Population
and Housing PUMS 5% Sample and a statistical/analytical software program (SPSS
6.1 for Macintosh).  The course does not require a background in statistical
analysis nor more mathematical background than high school algebra.  The primary
goal of the course is to enable students to be critical users of quantitative
analytical methods.  Students will  gain both a familiarity with the strengths
and weaknesses of these methods and become reasonably proficient with using a
statistical package to analyze and derive meaningful conclusions about social
phenomena.

<P>I.  Students will complete nine data exercises based on the readings and class
lectures.  These data exercises of approximately 3-5 pages each will illustrate
the main concepts and statistical techniques of quantitative social analysis
using data provided by the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social
Research (ICPSR) from the 1990 U.S. Census of Population and Housing PUMS 5%
Sample and SPSS 6.1 for Macintosh.  The due date for these data exercises will be
one week after each exercise is distributed in class.  The nine data exercises
will constitute 45% of your final grade.

<P>II.  Students will write a final paper based on the data exercises.  This
assignment will be described in detail at a later date.  The final paper is due <STRONG>9
December</STRONG>.  This paper will constitute 45% of your final grade.

<P>III.  The class format will be lecture/discussion.  You are expected to attend
all classes and be prepared to participate in class discussion with questions and
comments on the day's readings or on the data exercises.  Class attendance and
participation will constitute 10% of your final grade.

<P>IV.  You are encouraged to discuss your work with others, but the final product
is your own.  Paraphrasing of other students' work is a violation of the Honor
Principle as is Plagiarism.
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Grading:</STRONG></FONT>

<P>The grade for this course will be based on the data exercises, final paper, and
class participation.  The data exercises and final paper will be evaluated in
terms of (1) how well you understand and are able to ³reason with² the
methodological principles discussed in class and presented in the readings, and
(2) how proficiently you can apply these principles to an evaluation of the
results obtained in analyzing the data.
