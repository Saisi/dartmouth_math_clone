<P>	
    The general purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the 
    tools necessary to conceptualize, conduct, interpret, and communicate 
    research in the social sciences. Much of the focus of this course will 
    be on the data collection and quantitative analysis (descriptive and 
    inferential statistics) phases of research.  It is important to remember 
    that we are all consumers of quantitative information; consumer polls, 
    advertising claims, political outcomes, and the information in scientific 
    journals are all based on statistical reasoning.  A grasp of the basic 
    principles of scientific methodology and statistics provides you with 
    information to make intelligent life decisions outside your field of interest.  
    For example, in this course we will ponder such questions as,

	...why there are no more great .400 hitters in baseball,<BR> 
	...why the kind of survey you choose to listen to can 	
		tell you whether or not your spouse is having an affair, <BR>
	...which is more probable:  rolling at least one six in 		
	four throws of a single die or rolling at least one 		
	double six in 24 throws of a pair of dice, and <BR> 
	...which statistical test has been touted as one of the 		
	most important scientific discoveries of the 20th 			
	century.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>Required text:</STRONG>  
 
Moore & McCabe, <EM>Introduction to the Practice of	Statistics</EM>, 
Second edition, W.H. Freeman, 1993.
<BR>
Phillips, <EM>How to Think About Statistics</EM>,  Revised edition, 
W.H. Freeman,1992.
<P>
 
<STRONG>The instructor:</STRONG><BR>   
My office is 214 Gerry (X1659), and the door is 	
almost always open.  Feel free to come to me with questions 	
about the text, exams, lectures, and general administration 	
of the course.  My office hours for this course are Tuesdays 	
and Thursdays:  10:00-11:00am. However, I can be reached 	
almost any weekday morning.
<P>
<STRONG>The assistants:</STRONG><BR>   
Cynthia Wilson's 	office is Silsby 316A (x3431)<BR> 	
and her office hours are 	T:  12-1, and W: 10-11.
<P>
<STRONG>Class meetings:</STRONG> <BR>  
Class meetings will be in Rocky 2 on M-W-F:  	8:45-9:50am.  <BR>
Our X-hour, when needed, is scheduled for T: 	8:45-9:50.

<P><STRONG>Technical Support:</STRONG><BR>   
  You will need a scientific calculator 	
  and 	it should contain statistical functions and memory.  
  It will 	be needed for the homework and in-class exercises.

<P>Later in the semester you may need WORMSTAT Version 2.0, a 	
licensed application controlled by Dartmouth's Keyserver.  	
Follow the filepath "Public Test>Macintosh Software>Site 	
Licensed" to find it.  Please copy the manual to the computer 	
you use.
<P>
<STRONG>Requirements:</STRONG><BR>  
	The requirements for SS10 will be: 4 take-home exercises (20%
of your grade), three 1-hour exams (45% of your grade) a research
project (15% of your grade), class 	participation (5% of your
grade), and a cumulative final exam (15% of your final grade).

 <P>
	Exams:  <BLOCKQUOTE>There will be three hourly exams and a
            cumulative final.  Tests will consist a combination of
            multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, short answer and essay
			questions.  These exams will cover both the class
			meetings and the readings for one part of the course. 
		    Each exam is cumulative.


	<P>
			<EM>Policy for missed exams is very stringent.</EM>  For
        those few individuals who have legitimate reasons (illness,
		etc.) for not being able to take an exam at the
		scheduled time, arrangements for the taking of the
		exam prior to its scheduled time must be made with me <EM>as
		soon as you know that you cannot make the exam.</EM>  If a
		student misses an exam without an excuse, a grade of
		zero will result.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<P>	Exercises:  <BLOCKQUOTE>On four occasions during the
        semester, you will be given a take-home assignment to
        complete.  In some cases the assignment will concentrate on a
        writing assignment (explaining a scientific abstract,
		identifying a flaw in an experiment, etc.) and in other
		cases, the assignment will be a series of problem from
		the end of each chapter.  Exercises are usually
		collected the Wednesday after they have been handed out
		and late exercises will be assessed a penalty of 5% per
		day.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<P>	Project:  <BLOCKQUOTE>IIn order to apply the principles
        that you have learned during the course of the semester, we
        will require you to complete a research project of your own. 
		This assignment will require you to formulate a
		hypothesis, design an experiment, collect data, analyze
		that data and communicate your results.  This sounds
		challenging, but it can be the most interesting part of
		the semester.  We'll discuss the details of this project
		later in the semester.
