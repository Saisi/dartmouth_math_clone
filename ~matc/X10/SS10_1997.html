<P>	
    The general purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to 
	the tools necessary to conceptualize, conduct, interpret, 
	and communicate research in the social sciences.

<P><STRONG>Required text:</STRONG>  Moore, D.  <EM>The Basic Practice of Statistics</EM>, W.H. Freeman, 1995.*

<P><STRONG>Recommended texts:</STRONG><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Cozby, P.C. <EM>Methods in Behavioral Research</EM>, Fifth edition, 			
Mayfield, 1993.
<P>
Phillips, <EM>How to Think About Statistics</EM>,  Revised edition, W.H. Freeman,1992.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>*There is now a Student Study Guide available for Moore.  Not everyone finds it useful, 		
	but there are explanations of how to do some of the odd numbered exercises and 		
	may provide others with a more structured preparation for the exams.</BLOCKQUOTE>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
<STRONG>The instructor:</STRONG>  My office is 214 Gerry (X1659), and office hours for this course are MWF"s:  	
10-11am.  I will also try to hold official office hours one evening a week (usually 
on 	Wednesday, 7:30-8:30pm).  

<P><STRONG>The assistants:</STRONG>  Rose Clark's office is 317A Silsby (X3431) and Jennifer Tickle's office 	
is 318 Silsby (X3431).  Office hours will be announced as soon as possible.

<P><STRONG>Class meetings:</STRONG>  Class meetings will be in Rocky 1 on M-W-F:  8:45-10:00.  
Our X-hour, 	when needed, is scheduled for Th:  9-9:50pm.

<P><STRONG>Technical Support:</STRONG>  You will need a scientific calculator and 
it should contain statistical 	
functions and memory.  It will be needed for the homework and in-class exercises.  While 	
this is not to be considered an endorsement, I have always gotten by with a simple TI-25 or 	
TI-30X.  More sophisticated calculators are also welcome, but are useless unless you know 	
how to use them.

<P>	Later in the semester you may need WORMSTAT Version 2.0, a licensed application 	
controlled by Dartmouth's Keyserver.  Follow the filepath "Public>Licensed 	Software>Site 
Licensed Software>Wormstat 2.0.sit" to find it.  The file needs to be 	decompressed.  
For added information, copy the manual to the computer you use.  We 	
will try to hold a Wormstat clinic once or twice a semester for students who express 	
interest.
  <P>
<STRONG>Requirements:</STRONG>  The requirements for Social Science 10 will be: 
5 take-home exercises (20% of 	
your grade), four exams (60% of your grade) a research project (15% of your grade), and 	
optional project presentation (5% of your grade). 
 <P>
	Exams:  <BLOCKQUOTE>There will be four scheduled exams.  Tests will consist of a combination of 		
	multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, short answer and essay questions.  These exams 		
	will cover both the class meetings and the readings for one part of the course.  Each 		
	exam is cumulative.

<P>		<TT>Policy for missed exams is very stringent.</TT>  For those few individuals who have 		
    legitimate reasons (illness, etc.) for not being able to take an exam at the scheduled 		
    time, arrangements for the taking of the exam prior to its scheduled time must be 		
    made with me <TT>as soon as you know that you cannot make the exam.</TT>  If a student 		
    misses an exam without an excuse, a grade of zero will result.</BLOCKQUOTE> 

<P>	Exercises:  <BLOCKQUOTE>On five occasions during the semester, you will be given a take-home 			
assignment to complete.  In some cases the assignment will concentrate on a writing 		
assignment (explaining a scientific abstract, identifying a flaw in an experiment, 		
etc.) and in other cases, the assignment will be a series of problem from the end of 		
each chapter.  Exercises are usually collected a week after they have been handed 		
out and late exercises will be assessed a penalty of 5% per day.  Homework 		
answers will be posted in our course file kept within the Psychology folder on 		
Public.  You are allowed (and even encouraged to work with others on these 		
assignments).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>	Project:  <BLOCKQUOTE>In order to apply the principles that you have learned during the course of the 		
semester, we will require you to complete a research project of your own.  This 		
assignment will require you to formulate a hypothesis, design an experiment, 		
collect data, analyze that data and communicate your results.  This sounds 			
challenging, but it can be the most interesting part of the semester.  We'll discuss 		
the details of this project later in the semester.  The final project will be due 		
sometime during the last week of classes.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><STRONG>Alternative abilities:</STRONG>  I truly encourage those students with disabilities 
(as defined by the 	Academic Skill Center), including "invisible" disabilities like chronic 
diseases and learning 	disabilities, to discuss with me after class or during my office hours 
appropriate 	accommodations that might be useful to them.
