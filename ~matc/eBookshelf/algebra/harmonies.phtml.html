The MAC project began at Edmonds Community College in                 Lynnwood, Washington in 2000. It was supported by the National                 Science Foundation (DUE #0088149), Edmonds CC, and other local                 and state agencies. Over the four years of the project, MAC involved                 122 faculty representing 33 disciplines from 19 different high                 schools, colleges, and universities. The MAC project's goal                 was to support faculty in creating curricula to enable their students                 to experience the quantitative and mathematical aspects of many                 disciplines.

The geometric shapes (squares               and rectangles) are actually also cleverly disguised (!) Algebra               Tiles. This allows us at the conclusion of the project and critique               to translate student designs into math expressions. The math needed               for this project is Elementary Algebra. </P>            			  		              <P align="justify">Algebra tiles appeal to me because they can be               very helpful to people who have difficulty with algebra. I never               did particularly well in Algebra and I just figured I couldn't do               it. Variables didn't make sense to me. I wanted them to have a specific               value that didn't change. Sounds silly, I guess, but x and y or               a, b, and c didn't mean anything to me. I didn't understand what               to do with them. THEN I discovered Algebra Tiles! Even though they               still represented variables the shapes were concrete, I could touch               them, move them around, color them! And something clicked in my               brain. I hope that this activity will help algebra "click" for some               of your students! </P>			              <P>Instructor Sheet and Student Handout</P>
