Using	a constructivist approach, the text leads the reader through a series of	exercises designed to culminate in both the conjecture and proof of the	"Shibori Theorem".  Exercises are executed either through fold and clamp	Shibori or else by more traditional pencil and paper methods. 	Description of dying techniques and the artist's perspective are offered	by coauthor Joan Morris, who claims that doing these math exercises has	forever changed how she looks at her art.
