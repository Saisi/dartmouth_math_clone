One is the massive growth of the railway system. The other is the depopulation of rural England to the cities.  Did thegrowth of railways contribute to the population changes in England?  Andif we believe so, how can we make a convincing case for it based upondata?  The author brings statistical techniques and geographicinformation systems to bear on this question.  This text is trulyinterdisciplinary and could be used in a history course, a statisticscourse, or a geography course.</P><P ALIGN="left">To obtain this text, contact Robert Schwartz at rschwart@mtholyoke.edu.</P><A HREF="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/ind_rev/">The Industrial Revolution and the Railway System</A>,<BR>a web site containing useful materials for an exploration into historical statistics and geographic information systems,<BR>by Robert Schwartz</TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
