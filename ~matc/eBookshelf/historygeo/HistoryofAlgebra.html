Looselyspeaking, there are three such stages, and very few high school studentsgraduate with the ability to do algebra at the third, highest level. That last stage is exactly what characterizes developments in the 16thcentury in France.  Ermer not only gives us a picture of how mathematicsarrived there and what happened during that time frame, she also usesthe history as a window into the cognitive processes that stump students</P><P ALIGN="left">In addition to French developments, Ermer is careful to outline andemphasize the contributions of Islamic mathematicians during theso-called "dark ages" that have been downplayed or simply ignored instandard algebra texts.  Reintroducing this part of the history is a wayto respect the diversity of our mathematics students.</P><P ALIGN="left">Ermer's text is a perfect way for the anxious math student to revisitalgebra at the college level, as in the standard community collegecourse entitled "College Algebra".  It is also a revealing example ofmathematics in its historical context, directly addressing history ofmathematics standards in many preservice teacher education programs. Because of its insight into cognitive issues for students, this bookshould be required reading for every high school or middle school mathteacher.</P><P ALIGN="left">Available 2006.</P></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
