Our everyday language bears witness to thecentrality of time with scores of words and expressions that refer to itas a measure, a frame of reference, or an ordering factor for our lives,feelings, dreams, and histories. For the Aztecs time was a series of52-year cycles. At the end of each cycle, the sun would set and forthree days and nights the universe was up for grabs before the beginningof a new cycle. The Bible, on the other hand, inscribed another conceptof time, linear and chronological in the seven days of creation and thedetailed chronicles of endless genealogies.  Playing with time has beena favorite game in works of high culture--from the Greek sophists tocubism--and in popular culture--from H.G. Wells to Monty Python. Andtime is at the center of one of the most revolutionary scientifictheories of all time: Einstein's Theory of Relativity. In this text theauthors use mathematics, literature, and the arts to travel throughhistory, to explore and understand Time as a key concept and reality inthe development of Western culture and in our own twentieth century viewof ourselves and of the world.</P><P ALIGN="left">Available early 2004 from <A HREF= "http://www.keycollege.com/matc/index.html">Key College Publishing</A>.</P></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
