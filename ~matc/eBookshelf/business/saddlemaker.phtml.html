The MAC project began at Edmonds Community College in                 Lynnwood, Washington in 2000. It was supported by the National                 Science Foundation (DUE #0088149), Edmonds CC, and other local                 and state agencies. Over the four years of the project, MAC involved                 122 faculty representing 33 disciplines from 19 different high                 schools, colleges, and universities. The MAC project's goal                 was to support faculty in creating curricula to enable their students                 to experience the quantitative and mathematical aspects of many                 disciplines.

The answer can be somewhat variable depending on the initial size of the side of leather. The module involves first measuring a physical substance and then calculating a "real-world" selling price. Although specific to saddlemaking, this activity illustrates how important it is to know how to price raw materials in any small business.</P>
