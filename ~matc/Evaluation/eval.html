<P>In four years the Dartmouth Mathematics Across the Curriculum project
has created sixteen new courses: a six-course mathematics and physical
sciences sequence (IMPS), two intermediate mathematics applications for
science courses, and eight courses linking mathematics with a humanistic
discipline.  Additionally, it has influenced another thirteen,
supporting the creation of new mathematics modules, case studies, or
other interventions that add a mathematical lens.  The evaluation team
was charged with evaluating the effects of these courses on student
learning, faculty development and institutional culture.  Apportioning
our resources for maximum impact, we focused on four categories of
courses where the MATC influence was greatest: the IMPS sequence, the
Introduction to Calculus featuring real-life applications, intermediate
math applications for science, and the math and humanities courses.  The
evaluation results are based on extensive assessment&#150;using attitude
and achievement surveys, content tests, and in-depth interviews with
students and faculty&#150;of nineteen courses (a total of 36 course
iterations) taught by 27 different faculty (a total of 44
"faculty-courses") and involving over 1800 "student-courses."
<FONT SIZE="-1">[note 1. A faculty-course = one faculty teaching one
course.  A student-course = one student taking one course.  The
faculty/student-course total is higher than the number of students or
faculty involved because some faculty and some students taught or took
more than one course.]</FONT>
Looking at a broad range of courses over time allowed us to identify patterns in
student learning and faculty experience that transcend a single course
or discipline as well as to assess the effectiveness of MATC courses.

<I><P><FONT COLOR="#336600"><B>GENERAL FINDINGS</B></FONT></P></I>

<FONT FACE="Palatino"><P>&#149;<I> Students' interest in mathematics
is more important than their perceived math ability in determining
whether they study more mathematics.</I>  Many students who view
themselves as able mathematicians forego college mathematics because
they see no career utility or intellectual reward.</P></FONT>

<DIR><DIR>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=3><P>I have [AP] credit for calculus in high school
but I don't want to go on. I've taken math every year of my life. But
I'm not planning on doing something [that requires] higher levels of
math. I'm decent at math, I usually get decent grades, but I don't enjoy
math. (Mathematics and the New Universe student)</P>

<P>Since I came to Dartmouth the math courses I've
taken, like multivariable calculus and differential equations, are
really dry. You're always plugging and chugging numbers and doing proofs
and stuff, and I really didn't like that so I stopped taking math
courses altogether. Then I saw this course on the bulletin and it
sounded really interesting because it encompassed a lot of different
subjects, like infinity and the fourth dimension. I thought wow, this is
so cool. (Science Fiction student)</P></FONT>
 
</DIR></DIR>

<FONT FACE="Palatino"><P>&#149; <I>Real-life applications make mathematics more
approachable and more interesting</I>.  Whether students' interests are
pre-med, pre-engineering or pre-history, connecting mathematics to their
existing interests transforms math from a "cut and dried" requirement to
a relevant tool for advancing their learning.</P></FONT>

<DIR>

<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=3><P>Taking a probabilty density function and finding out
possible periods of incubation based on time of infection and things
like that, I feel that's something a real doctor would do. You take this
function and you find out when your patient was infected and you say,
okay, you can possibly come down with AIDS in six years. That's very
useful, for doctor and patient, you know? I thought it was really cool,
to be frank. It was pretty cool. (Calculus Applications for Medicine
and Biology student)</P>

<P>The chaos part of it made it seem a lot more interesting and
colorful.  I had thought of math as a black and white sort of thing,
like pencil and paper and you write everything down.  But just from
pictures and stuff of strange attractors, they're so colorful and
interesting.  I guess it made it more colorful, sort of, having to put
it to use. (Chaos student)</P>
</FONT>

</DIR></DIR>

<FONT FACE="Palatino"><P>&#149; <I>Expanding the range of mathematics topics accessible
to average college students increases their interest in mathematics.</I>
 To most entering college students, calculus <I>is</I> upper level math.
As a result, many who do not need calculus in their careers turn away
from college math altogether.  Students were excited by courses that
offered non-calculus topics (combinatorics, number theory, group theory,
probability, etc.), revealing unsuspected new worlds of mathematics to
discover and enjoy.</P></FONT>

<DIR>
<DIR>

<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=3><P>This course broke the calculus teaching level of math.
I'd always associated calculus with knowing upper level math.  Now I
know calculus is just one section of a much broader mathematical area. 
Discrete math is big in its own right. (Discrete Mathematics for
Computer Science student)</P>

<P>[The math] was basically just conceptual.  Usually  when you do
math you don't really sit there and think about why it is the way it is;
it's kind of a cut and dried type thing.  So that was the best part of
the course for me, to sit there and think about infinity and all that
stuff. ( Matter of Time student)</P>

<FONT FACE="Palatino"><P>&#149; <I>In-class group work helps college students learn
mathematics.</I>  Provided that the problem is pitched at the right
level&#150;neither so difficult that no start can be made nor so easy
that it can be quickly solved alone&#150;students report that they learn
better if they spend a portion of the class time working together on
problems.</P></FONT>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=3><DIR>
<DIR>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P>They would give us a problem in class, and
we&#146;d have to do it right there in class, instead of just talking at
us the whole time.  That really helped me get out of just the note
taking, write down whatever the professor says, but don&#146;t really
process it.  Sometimes I get in [that] mode, but [group work] really
helped me to internalize it, because you&#146;d see it right away,
before you&#146;d actually go read about it on your own. [Then]
you&#146;d really see oh, this is why I&#146;m trying to do it.  This is
what I&#146;m trying to solve, plus helping me to learn to interact with
other people, learn from other people, too. I thought it was just to be
a great way of learning. (IMPS student)</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=3>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P>Two or three minds are better than one.  And
you&#146;re going to have a diversity of ways of thinking, a little more
total creativity, and we&#146;ll get some different ideas thrown out
there, and we have more people to test them, and that works pretty well.
 Then you follow up on one idea that you think is good, and you keep
working faster on it. It&#146;s kind of like you have three minds linked
in parallel.  They can all work together, and then you can process
things faster. (IMPS student)</P></FONT>

</DIR>

<FONT FACE="Palatino"><P>&#149;<I> Interdisciplinary courses model the kind of
creative, "out of the box" thinking needed in today's complex world.</I>
Linking quantitative to non-quantitative knowledge is particularly
needed, but appears to be notably difficult for students. Courses where
professors with widely differing perspectives make that connection
introduce students to a critical intellectual process they are otherwise
unlikely to encounter directly.</P></FONT>

<DIR>
<DIR>
<FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=3><P>[What I learned was] the interdisciplinary
approach&#150;just knowing how to integrate material that doesn't
necessarily at the beginning seem like it would fit together.  Finding
ways, exploring ways and being creative in math which you
wouldn't&#150;you'd say creative and math don't go together. You're not
creative in math. But you can be. And learning that you can be. And
learning that when someone says, "Can you do these two things?" and you
say, 'No," you probably can. You just need to figure out how. (Pattern
student)</P>

<P>I always knew I was missing something, in that I didn't know exactly
how I was supposed to put the math that I knew&#150;all the math one
side of my brain&#150;into all the other stuff on the other side of my
brain.  I think this course helped me to kind of bridge the gap. That's
probably the best thing it did for me. (Calculus Applications for

<P>Chemist:  It was fun because it was a challenge.  Fitting it all
together and  making it appear to the students that it's all connected
was a challenge, but it was fun to do that.  It was also really
rewarding to know that I could do a chemistry application of some
physical principle, knowing they had just seen the physical principle,
and seeing how[the physicist] presented it so I can adapt the lecture to
say, here's what we learned in Physics.  Here's the principle.  Here's
how it all works. </P></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=3>Humanist: I want to see what
doing the mathematics does to my understanding of, say,  Augustine's
<U>Confessions</U>.  I want to see what happens when I go back to <U>One
Hundred Years of Solitude</U> after learning modern theories of time. 
In other words, I want to see what happens to thinking when you
cross-pollinate like that.  To me, that&#146;s the real fun of doing
it.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=3>Mathematician: When I make a
breakthrough reading a humanities text, I feel less isolated (than when
making a mathematical breakthrough). I feel that it has more connection
with the rest of life.  You read <U>One Hundred of Solitude</U> and you
feel it says something about the way human nature is , and the way human
beings behave.  And  when you can connect the math with that, I feel
like I&#146;m just more connected with humanity.</P></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Palatino">
<P>&#149; <I>Integrated Mathematics and Physical Sciences.</I> 
IMPS, which ran for two years as a three-term, six-course
team-taught interdisciplinary math/physics/chemistry sequence for
first-year students, is presently a two-term, four-course math/physics
offering. Now in its fourth year, it has involved nine faculty members
in teaching (five from math, four from science) and as many more in
planning and support.  168 students (most of them pre-engineering) have
accumulated 626 "student-courses."  IMPS asks students to work hard, to
work together, and to understand connections between math and science. 
Students believe it succeeds: "[The strength of the course] is the way
it ties together math and physics.  It's easier to learn, it's easier to
understand, you understand it more thoroughly, and you understand
applications. I think it speeds up the learning process, and it provided
a lot of insight that is more difficult to grab on your own. They lead
you through a lot of connections that I probably wouldn't have made
until much later on."  Through shared intellectual effort, "Impsters"
(as they call themselves) emerge as a social unit as well&#150;a
community of scholars in the best liberal arts tradition.</P>

<P>Because evaluation results are from the three years before IMPS
stabilized its term length and teaching materials, we view present
results as suggestive rather than conclusive.</P>

<P>&#149; There are no significant differences between IMPS students and
traditional students in their subsequent total GPA, science GPA or
engineering GPA or in their overall continuation into a science, math or
engineering (SMET) major.  In the first two years, 91% of IMPS
completers declared SMET majors or minors, with the majority (63%) in
engineering.  85% of traditional track (Physics 14) students chose a
SMET major or minor.  Performance of the two groups on various content
tests is mixed.</P>

<P>&#149; IMPS consistently recruits students into the engineering
track: more students finish the course intending to be engineers than
enter with that goal.   Completion of the IMPS sequence itself is also
good and getting better, from 68% in year 1, to 84% in year 2 and 88% in
year 3.</P>

<P>&#149; Professors in subsequent engineering courses rate the teamwork
abilities of IMPS students significantly above that of their
conventionally prepared peers.</P>

<P>&#149; IMPS may advantage women.  Women IMPS engineering majors
posted the highest engineering GPA's, followed by traditional track men,
traditional track women, and IMPS men. The GPA difference between
traditionally prepared men and lower-performing IMPS men is
statistically significant; the equivalent GPA difference between the
smaller samples of IMPS women and lower-performing traditional track
women is not. The perplexing performance difference between IMPS women
and men raises questions about learning style that should be explored,
particularly the role of collaboration and group support, the presence
of female role models, and the possibility that new instructional
pedagogies may have different consequences for men and women, increasing
cognitive load and/or interfering with established learning strategies.
</P>

<P>&#149; Three years' worth of interview data indicate that IMPS offers
an academic experience that is engaging, intense and deeply rewarding. 
Asked what he would take away from the course, one student wrote, "Math
and science is scary and messy and wonderful and exciting. It's no
longer about right and wrong answers; there are so many more things to
think about. IMPS math and science isn't cameo, homogenized topics; it's
the real thing at times&#150;headaches and all."</P>

<P>&#149;<I> Intermediate Mathematics Applications Courses.</I>
"Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science" and "Applications of
Calculus to Medicine and Biology" were tightly focused courses which,
like IMPS, targeted specific populations and tailored the mathematics
directly to their interests.  Using problems from the respective
disciplines to motivate the mathematics (e.g., encryption, the growth of
the AIDS virus) and involving students through group work and regular
discussion, these highly successful courses stand as models for
post-introductory mathematics offerings. The 58 students in these
courses, most of whom entered with an introductory calculus background,
left with their interest in mathematics heightened, their confidence
buoyed, a new view of mathematics, and a lot of interesting and useful
mathematics under their belts.</P>

<P>&#149; <I>Mathematics and Humanities Courses.</I>  417 students and
fourteen different faculty members have participated in eight courses
linking mathematics (mostly non-calculus) with art, music, philosophy,
and literature.  These courses have surmounted the daunting challenge of
making mathematics accessible to a population ranging in preparation
from high school algebra to differential equations, and in interest from
the terrified to the wildly enthusiastic.  As students perceive that
mathematics can illuminate humanistic subjects (and vice versa), they
also appreciate that mathematics can be a creative undertaking which is
useful in all fields.  Surveys reveal increased confidence and a new
openness to mathematical thinking.  Perhaps as important as their
mathematical gains is their exposure to interdisciplinary dialogue.  As
professors actively construct a conversation between highly disparate
disciplines, they model the kind of intellectual agility needed to
negotiate an increasingly compartmentalized world.  As one student
concluded of her experience, "This course makes you think, and that's
not a cliche."</P>

<I><P>&#149; Introduction to Calculus with
Real-life Applications.</I> The Fall Mathematics 3 course uses real
open-ended case studies (such as Milankovich's theory about glacier
formation) as the vehicle for teaching calculus concepts.  By
recapitulating the analysis on computers, many students appreciate that
the calculus they are learning can be used to answer questions that are
real, practical, and interesting.  As one related, "Instead of just
learning some nonsense you're not going to use, Math 3 brought it more
into the real world, where you see you are actually going to use it
sometime in the future."  Working with case studies also gave students a
deeper understanding of the mathematics: "It showed me that math wasn't
as clean cut as everyone perceived it to be. You have to understand
what's going on."  The value of the case study concept has been
confirmed through students like these (a majority of the class in 1997),
but it has been harder to extend those successes to the full range of
Math 3 students.  1998 revisions of the case studies intended to make
them more broadly relevant were not successful, but the effort usefully
emphasized lessons which will guide ongoing modifications: applications
must be varied, relevant to student interests, keyed to the level of
student learning, and require doing real mathematics.</P>

<P>Comparison of the 449 Fall calculus students with their 202 peers in
the standard Winter course has been complicated for the last two years
by Winter personnel changes and Fall curricular changes.  One result has
been consistent: Fall students have scored better than Winter students
on a math test taken ten weeks after the course, although that
difference has not always been statistically significant.</P>

<I><P><FONT COLOR="#336600"><B>FACULTY OUTCOMES</B></FONT></P></I>

<P>Faculty benefit from involvement in interdisciplinary courses,
and for many of the same reasons as students.  Like students, they
discover that interdisciplinary courses are more work than traditional
courses, but well worth the investment.  Working with colleagues from
other departments allows them to be students again, exploring other
fields and approaching their own from a fresh perspective.  Pedagogical
issues are forced into the open and strategies shared as collaborating
instructors confront novel teaching challenges.  One of the most
productive interchanges occurs between novice and established faculty:
the experienced teacher mentors the novice, while the junior member
introduces the senior to new pedagogical techniques which are
incorporated into his or her tool kit.  Similarly, faculty are
introduced to new pedagogy as they join the teaching rotation for these
courses.  Designing and teaching an interdisciplinary course exemplifies
the project's applications-based philosophy that we learn better in the
context of problems that are real and compelling.  Pedagogical issues
that would draw professorial yawns in a teaching methods workshop are
riveting when their own material and students are directly at stake.
 </P>

<P>Collaborative teaching also counteracts debilitating departmental
isolation.  Repeatedly, faculty (especially junior faculty) regretted
that they had few contacts outside their departments and enjoyed little
of the collegial interchange that ought to pervade a liberal arts
campus.  While interdisciplinary courses represent some additional cost
to the College, the payoff in professional development is substantial. 
Faculty are intellectually energized, establish complex relationships
with their colleagues, acquire new teaching skills and, of course, teach
their students better.  Many professors report that collaborative
teaching has been such a rewarding intellectual, personal, and
pedagogical experience they wish they could co-teach all their
courses.</P>

<I><P><FONT COLOR="#336600"><B>INSTITUTIONAL OUTCOMES</B></FONT></P></I>

<P>The heart of a college is its faculty, and as faculty pursue
opportunities to grow as scholars and teachers, the institution gains. 
Through its interdisciplinary course development, MATC has offered a
mechanism for professional growth that complements and extends the
College's existing interdisciplinary teaching structure.  The number of
regular faculty who wish to teach interdisciplinary courses alongside
mathematicians continues to increase.  The project has also reinforced
on campus and beyond the importance and feasibility of interdisciplinary
learning as preparation for the real work of the world.  The success of
courses like IMPS and the College's support for MATC encouraged a group
of College and Medical School faculty to establish the interdisciplinary
Human Biology Program.  Likewise, MATC provided an example for faculty
seeking to create an interdisciplinary materials science graduate
program.  The enhanced opportunities for students and faculty to engage
in a mode of thinking widely believed to be critical to twenty-first
century success places the College in the vanguard of higher education
institutions. Extending the interdisciplinary and numeracy message well
beyond the Hanover campus, MATC authors have produced nine manuscripts
scheduled for publication by Key College Publishing in the next eighteen
months (with more in preparation), hosted 137 faculty at five workshops,
mounted an art exhibit in collaboration with the Hood Museum, created
math videos, and established a website&#150;to name only some of its
varied activities.  Finally, and perhaps most important, MATC has raised
the issue of quantitative competence with administrators and, one by
one, with participating faculty.  MATC's efforts to improve mathematics
instruction for all students addresses a serious national issue whose
solution will require the cooperation of educational institutions at all
levels.</P>
