Itcovers the same material as Mathematics 8, 13, and Physics 13, 14.  However, the IMPS syllabus has been arranged so that the mathematics andthe physical applications are presented in a more coordinated mannerthan in the traditional courses.   IMPS is jointly developed and taughtby faculty from mathematics, physics, and engineering, and will beexcellent preparation for students planning majors in engineering,physics, chemistry, earth science, or applied mathematics.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><h3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">Who may take IMPS?</FONT></h3><BLOCKQUOTE>Any first year student who has credit for Math 3  may enroll in IMPS.You should be familiar with differentiation and various techniques ofdifferentiation, integration (although not necessarily with advancedtechniques of integration), the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus thatrelates differentiation and integration, and know how to apply theseconcepts to polynomial, trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponentialfunctions.   You can get credit for Math 3 in any of the following ways:<UL>	<LI>Score 4 or better on the AP Calculus AB exam	<LI>Score 2 or better on the AP Calculus BC exam	<LI>Score 6 or better on the appropriate International Baccalaureate exam	<LI>Pass the Dartmouth math department's placement exam, given during        Orientation Week.   This test is open to anyone who wants to take       it-- you don't have to be invited.   Consult your Orientation Week       schedule for time and place.</UL></BLOCKQUOTE><h3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">What are the advantages of IMPS over the traditional track?</FONT></h3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>The order of topics in the mathematics courses was designed toclosely track the application of mathematics by the physics courses, andthe math and physics teachers collaborate on the development andteaching of the course.   We believe this will better enable students tosee the connections between mathematics and physics, and to applymathematics in their later science or engineering courses.   There willbe a lab/computer/study room dedicated to IMPS where students can worktogether and obtain assistance from the teaching assistants andprofessors.  And, while both IMPS and the traditional track satisfy thecollege distributive requirements in laboratory science and quantitativeand deductive science, IMPS additionally satisfies the interdisciplinaryrequirement.</P>                             </BLOCKQUOTE><h3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">What are the disadvantages?</FONT></h3><BLOCKQUOTE>IMPS is slightly less flexible than the traditional track.   IMPS isonly offered in the fall and winter, in only one section.   However, theother required courses for the first year, English 5 and the First-YearSeminar, are offered in multiple sections so conflicts will notoccur.	</P></BLOCKQUOTE><h3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">Is IMPS a faster-paced, more in-depth, harder course than the traditional track? </FONT></h3><BLOCKQUOTE><P> The scope and pace of IMPS are similar to that of the traditionalPhysics 13-14 sequence.   Labs are approximately weekly (by the way, anominal lab fee of $16 per term, billed to your student account, coversthe lab notebook, lab manual, and expendable supplies). IMPS requiresyou take math and physics simultaneously, which can be more intense thanthe traditional track.  However, we believe that the hard work will payoff in the long run, because of the synergy between the math andphysics.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><h3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">Will graduate schools accept IMPS?</FONT></h3><BLOCKQUOTE><P> IMPS is completely equivalent to the traditional  courses, and even goes beyond them in certain ways. </P></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">How does IMPS relate to majors?</FONT></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>IMPS satisfies some prerequisites for the engineering, physics,chemistry, earth science, and applied mathematics majors.   IMPS is notdesigned to prepare students for majors in computer science or biology,although these students are welcome in IMPS if they find it doesn'tconflict with the prerequisites for those majors.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">Can you give me general information about the ______ major?</FONT></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Your best sources of information about particular majors are thedepartment open houses and information sessions held during OrientationWeek.   Consult your Orientation Week schedule for times and places.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">What advantage does IMPS have over thetraditional track for an engineering student? </FONT></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>We expect that the coupling of mathematics with physical applicationsin IMPS will better equip you to apply mathematics later in yourengineering studies.  You will also get an advance look at engineeringvia some of the IMPS labs.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860"> How can I take introductory chemistry and IMPS?</FONT></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>IMPS should be particularly appealing to students interested inphysical chemistry. We do not recommend, however, that you takeChemistry 5 or 10 simultaneously with IMPS.   If you have a score of 5on the AP chemistry test, you may take Chemistry 6 in the spring term,after IMPS.  Otherwise, you should either take the traditional track inmathematics and physics, or take IMPS in your sophomore year.  DuringOrientation Week, you will have opportunities to meet with chemistryfaculty to discuss these options.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">Can people who are interested in pursuing lifescience majors participate in IMPS?   Is IMPS worthwhile for a premed?</FONT></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Potential biology or biochemistry majors and premedical students arewelcome in IMPS  Medical schools require two terms of physics and atleast one term of mathematics, so IMPS will help with your premedrequirements.   However, IMPS is scheduled at the same time as theintroductory biology courses (Biology 14, 15, and 16), some of which areusually taken in the first year.  If you do take IMPS, you can takeBiology 15 or 16 in the spring term; if you have a score of 5 on the APchemistry test, you may also take Chemistry 6 in the spring term.  Alternatively, you may take IMPS during your sophomore year.   DuringOrientation Week, you will have opportunities to meet with biologyfaculty and the premedical advisors to discuss these options.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">Is IMPS a good option for a potential math major?</FONT></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P> If you are thinking about majoring in math, IMPS  may well be foryou.   IMPS was designed for applied math majors as well as physicalscience majors.   If you are sure you want to major in pure rather thanapplied math, you might rather choose honors calculus courses duringyour first year.   But whether you take IMPS or honors calculus in yourfirst year will be much less significant than your choice of courses inlater years. If you take IMPS and later decide on pure mathematics, IMPSwill have helped you satisfy the science distributive requirements aswell as the math prerequisites.   The math department will have an openhouse during Orientation Week where you can meet faculty and discuss themajor.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">I am undecided about majoring in science.   Is IMPS a good idea for me?</FONT></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Because of the time commitment involved, most students who choose totake IMPS are pretty certain of their interest in physical science,engineering, or applied math.   If you take IMPS and eventually decidenot to major in science, IMPS will still satisfy four of your liberalarts distributive requirements.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">How do I sign up for IMPS?</FONT></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>The IMPS sequence consists of Science 13 and Math 15.1 in the fall,and Science 14 and <A HREF="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m152w01" TARGET="_self">Math 15.2</A> in the winter.   You enroll in both themath and science courses each term.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">Does it have to be fall and winter?</FONT></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P> IMPS is offered only in the fall and winter terms.   The traditionalPhysics 13 is offered in the fall and  winter, Physics 14 is offered inthe spring, and the traditional math classes are offered in all terms.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">Can you take IMPS in the sophomore year?</FONT></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Yes, although we recommend you take it in the first year, while yourhigh school math and physics are fresh in your mind.</P> </BLOCKQUOTE><H3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">If I have enough advanced placement credit, can I just do the second term?</FONT></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>No.  Everyone in IMPS begins with the fall term.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">What happens to my AP math credits if I take IMPS? </FONT></H3> <BLOCKQUOTE>If you have one AP credit, it appears on your transcript as a credit for Math 3.  In the past, a student with two AP credits would surrender thesecond credit  to take IMPS.  As a result, many students chose not totake IMPS, opting instead  to take credit for Math 3 and 8 and enter thetraditional track at Math  13.  Last year the order of topics in Math 8 and 13 were changed, so that it is no longer possible to get credit forMath 8 via any  exam other than the math department's placement exam. If you got a 4 or 5 on the Calculus BC exam, you will get a secondunspecified credit which you do not have to give up to take Math 8 or totake IMPS. If you do take the placement  exam and obtain credit for Math8, you will have to surrender that  credit in order to take IMPS.  It isalso possible for a very advanced  student to get credit for Math 13 bypassing a special exam, arranged  through the math department's advisorto first year students.  Such a  student would already know most of themathematics in IMPS and would  probably give strong consideration totaking honors physics (Physics 15, 16, 17).</BLOCKQUOTE><H3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">Is enrollment limited?</FONT></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>There is no enrollment limit in IMPS.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">How do I get advice about choosing othercourses in addition to IMPS? How flexible is the scheduling of non-IMPSclasses?</FONT></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>During Orientation Week, all the academic departments at Dartmouthwill have open houses where you can meet faculty and discuss majors andcourses.   In addition, there will be special meetings for studentsinterested in honors courses, advanced placement,  etc. Read yourOrientation Week schedule carefully to identify these meetings, and besure to attend the ones which pertain to you.  You will be able toconsult the class timetable during Orientation Week to see how othercourses will fit into your schedule along with IMPS.  We will also beinforming all the first-year advisors about IMPS so they will beprepared to help you (or refer you to one of the IMPS faculty).</P><P>IMPS classes are scheduled for the 9 and 10 hours (8:45-9:50,followed by 10:00-11:05, on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday).   Labs areone afternoon per week.   First year students take English 5 (unlessthey have AP credit), about half in the fall term and the rest in thewinter term.   They also take a first-year seminar, or Humanities 1 and2 instead of the seminar.   IMPS will not conflict with English 5 orHumanities 1-2.    IMPS may conflict with your first choice for afirst-year seminar, but the potential for conflict is no worse than ifyou were taking something other than IMPS.   If you want to take  IMPS,you should be careful not sign up for a first-year seminar that meetsduring  the 9 or 10 hours.  Some foreign language and introductorybiology courses conflict with IMPS, requiring you to postpone them untilthe spring term.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">What mathematics is covered in IMPS?</FONT></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>The mathematics covered by IMPS is basically that in Math 8 and 13,with some material from Math 23.  It concentrates on multivariablecalculus and elementary differential equations, and includes sometechniques of integration and notions of sequences and series.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">I would like to take honors courses in mathematics.   Can I do this and IMPS too? </FONT></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>If you are considering the mathematics honors program, you can eithertake IMPS or honors calculus courses during your first year, but notboth.   IMPS will focus more on the connections between mathematics andphysical science, whereas the honors versions of Math 8 and Math 13 willfocus more on the strictly mathematical subtleties.   If you do selectIMPS, you will still have the math background you need to take honorsmath courses beginning with your sophomore year, as well as major inmath and/or write an honors thesis.   The math department will have ameeting for potential honors students during Orientation Week. </P></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">I took AP Physics in high school.   Will the physics portion of IMPS be all  review? </FONT></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>The physics in IMPS (and in the traditional introductory Physics13-14) is calculus-based mechanics and electromagnetism, and emphasizesdifferential equations for modeling and analyzing physical systems.   Ifyou have a strong math background, you could take the honors physicssequence (Physics 15, 16, 17) instead of IMPS and have much less review.  Dartmouth does not award credit for Physics 13-14 on the basis of theAP exams, but the physics department will offer its own placement testsduring Orientation Week.   Consult your schedule for details.  Thesetests are not required for admission to IMPS.</P> </BLOCKQUOTE><H3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">I did not have a strong high school physics course.   Can I take IMPS?</FONT></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P> Yes.  Like the traditional track, IMPS does not assume you have an extensive physics background. </P> </BLOCKQUOTE><H3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">How is IMPS related to WISP?</FONT></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>WISP, the Women In Science Program, provides research internships forfirst year women students interested in science or engineering.   IMPSstudents have participated in WISP internships.</P> </BLOCKQUOTE><H3><FONT COLOR="#3C7860">Is there partial credit if I bail out?</FONT></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>If you complete the first term of IMPS, but do not continue into thesecond, you will receive credit equivalent to Math 8 and Physics 13, andbe able to join Math 13 and Physics 14 on the traditional track.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><HR><center><font size=2>&copy; &nbsp; Eric W.
