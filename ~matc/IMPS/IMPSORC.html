The sequenceis designed and team taught by faculty in Mathematics, Physics, andEngineering Science, and is intended for first-year students whoanticipate majoring in physical science, engineering and/or appliedmathematics. First-year students who have received credit for Math 3 orhigher.</P><P>Science 13, 14 and Mathematics 15.1, 15.2 are closely related coursesthat must be taken during two consecutive terms:</P><P>Science 13 and Mathematics 15.1 during the Fall term, and Science 14 andMathematics 15.2 during the Winter term. A student completing thefour-course sequence will receive credit equivalent to Physics 13, 14,and Mathematics 11, 13.</P><P>Students who do not complete the entire sequence will receive partialcredit. A student who completes the first term will receive credit forScience 13 and Math 15.1, satisfying the prerequisites for Math 13 andPhysics 14.</P>		</TD>	</TR>	 </TABLE></BODY></HTML>
