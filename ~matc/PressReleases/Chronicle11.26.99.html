THE VIEWER'S first impression of <I>Farewell</I> may be an endless sequence of
nested boxes, or per haps of a tunnel receding forever into the
distance. A figure stands in front of the meeting point of the receding
squares, so that most of the squares are behind her head-at most seven
squares are actually represented in paint. To understand this painting,
one must understand how the artist has made the viewer see the sequence
as infinite, and why.

<P ALIGN="left">
<I>Farewell</I> was inspired by the death of Tooker's mother and the memory of
a hospital corridor barred with light from open doors along its walls.
The abstract image Tooker has produced from this memory touches on the
infinite and uses both the mathematical and the symbolic and emotional
aspects of infinity to communicate its message.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
In her article "Infinity in God and Mathematics,"
Jill Le Blanc contrasts these two aspects of infinity. She suggests that
the relation of the mathematical infinite to the infinity we attribute
to God is that of metaphor.  The mathematical infinite cannot describe
or explain God's infiniteness, but it can symbolize it:
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
"What the concept of the infinite can express about God does not lie in
the gradual mathematical demystifying of the concept, nor even in the
residual strange bits of the mathematical infinite, but rather in the
wonder (or dread) we have felt in being introduced to infinite series or
set theory, or in looking at Escher's pictures, or at the sky at night."
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
This metaphorical role of the mathematical infinite illuminates the use
of the infinite in <I>Farewell</I>. Tooker uses the visual image of an infinite
sequence to create a mathematical metaphor with immediate emotional
impact.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
In <I>Farewell</I>, which is the most abstract of Tooker's paintings, the
artist's technique serves to integrate the two aspects of infinity. The
abstractness of the work contributes to its ability to communicate the
concept of infinity; the beginning of a repeating pattern is apparent in
the starkly explicit geometry of the nested squares, and the viewer
extrapolates its continuation behind the figure's head as endless. This
extrapolation, as it turns out, is mathematically justified.
