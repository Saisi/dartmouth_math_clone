Sarah Billmeier had always done well in math, but shortly after
enrolling in her second calculus course at Dartmouth College, she quit.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
"I just didn't understand the point anymore," Billmeier said.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Her classmate Elizabeth Cullen's distaste for math was even stronger.
"I hated it, and wanted to get out of it," she said. "I had had just
horrible math experiences before."
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
However, both found themselves drawn to an unusual math course called
"Pattern" that showed, among other things, how fractals and chaos
theory could help with painting and textile patterns. By the time it was
over, both students had changed their minds about math.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
"It made you think about math in a different way," Cullen said. "It
was actually useful. I can't say now I'd be comfortable doing equations,
but I definitely feel more comfortable with my ability to do math."
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Billmeier said, "I had never learned what calculus was applied to when
I was learning it before. ["Pattern"] showed us where math was
basically everywhere."
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
"Pattern" is part of Dartmouth's Math Across the Curriculum Project,
now in its fifth year. Backed by a $4 million grant from the National
Science Foundation, the project has changed how math is taught at this
college of 4,300 undergraduates. Thirty new courses have been created
that take math out of its usual confines and spread it around campus,
frequently in areas where it has never been before.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Some classes, such as "Math for Medicine and Biology," are giving
science and pre-med students a more intensive exposure to math than
usual. In the past, despite the apparent connections between the
subjects, students in these fields had only limited math requirements.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Other classes in the new curriculum attract students with their unusual
combinations of disciplines, such as "Math and the Philosophy of the
Infinite."
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Jane Korey, who has been responsible for evaluating the outcome of Math
Across the Curriculum courses, regards the project as a success. She has
interviewed at least 10 students in each course offered, out of the
approximately 2,100 students who have taken the classes since 1994.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
"We've been able to learn a lot more about how students learn math and
respond to it," Korey said. "When I was a student way back when, we
always thought that smart people learned math best. But what I see is
that motivation is far more important than anything else.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
"Tapping into their interest is key," she said. "It's a step that has
to precede the teaching of skills."
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The project already has produced results among math and science
students. Calculus students who had taken a course that showed its
real-world uses were tested seven weeks later. They scored twice as high
as students who had taken a traditional "pure math" calculus course.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The impact has also shown up in a rigorous, yearlong course that taught
how math is used in science, yet another topic that mathematicians do
not traditionally teach. At the start of the course, 68 percent of the
students, all of whom were freshmen, said they planned to major in hard
sciences, such as math, chemistry, engineering, and physics. By the end
of the course, the figure had risen to 88 percent.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The most unusual new courses are those blending math and the humanities.
One such course, "A Fire in the Equations," combined science-fiction
stories and math. Professors Laurence Davies and Jody Trout spent a year
preparing the course. Davies covered the literary aspects of the stories
each week, while Trout taught the math. The third class period, on
Fridays, was reserved for discussions.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
One week the focus was "The Infinite Assassin" by Greg Eagan. "It's a
parallel world story," Trout said. "A lot of things are going on
across dimensions, but if you don't understand [dimensional]
construction, it's hard to understand the story on a deeper level."
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Trout introduced students to the Cantor set, a mathematical concept.
"It has some very bizarre properties which have dire consequences for
the main character," he said. "By appreciating the math you can see
the character is doomed."
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Teaching the course was not easy, the two said. For someone who had not
taken math in years, said Davies, "it was a stretch." Davies noted
that he also had to adjust his free-flowing lecture style to Trout's
highly structured math lectures.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The course did not work for all students. One, who asked not to be
identified, said, "The range of students in the class was so broad, the
professors had to approach both subjects at a high school level."
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Nonetheless, Korey said that most students are positive about the
approach to math taken in "The Fire in the Equations" and other
courses.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
At Dartmouth, students are often exposed to connections and applications
they have never seen before, Korey said.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
"What I heard over and over was, `At last I understand why they wanted
me to take calculus,'" Korey said.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Mathematics professor Dwight Lahr concedes that math is almost always
taught in isolation from other fields. "The connections with other
disciplines and other parts of life are of very small importance in
math," Lahr said. Yet when Lahr taught "A Matter of Time" with
professor Beatriz Pastor more than 160 students signed up, making it the
first math course to require an enrollment cap, he said.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The course looked at time from both mathematical and literary
perspectives, beginning with Aristotle and Plato and concluding with
Gabriel Garcia Marquez's "One Hundred Years of Solitude."
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
"For the science students, we said you could study all of Newton's
theory [of time] and you had not covered one-tenth of the complexity and
depth in the monologue of the clock in [Shakespeare's] `Richard II'"
Pastor said.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The course also tried to show how math could enrich the humanities.
Pastor used the example of a paradox presented by the Greek philosopher
Xeno in 500 BC that was not resolved until the development of a
mathematical solution in the 19th century. "In between you have 24
centuries of debate," Pastor said, "but humanists couldn't close the
debate. It took a mathematician to do so."
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The two professors faced the usual difficulties adjusting their teaching
styles and dealing with unfamiliar disciplines, but Pastor and Lahr had
the additional challenge of being married to each other.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
"We'd be brushing out teeth and one of us would say, `Hey, what about
this?'" said Lahr. "Then you'd be thinking about it all night. We had
to come up with rules" to limit discussion.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Pastor and Lahr said that their focus on one of the central issues of
human existence, time, tapped into students' interest in the major
questions of life. However, the mixing of humanities and math did not
satisfy everyone.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Responding to questions e-mailed to her, sophomore Rochelle Bourgault
said, "I am now very skeptical of courses that radiate `Take me!' from
the course guide. `A Matter of Time' sounded wonderful. To me, it was
sheer drudgery."
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
She added, "I think I've had my fill of these experimental
interdisciplinary courses. I think it's very difficult to draw together
two disparate disciplines in a purely lecture-oriented class."
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
On the other hand, philosophy major Tam Boyar ranked "A Matter of
Time" as "one of the top three courses I've taken at Dartmouth."
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Other colleges and universities are already at work making math courses
more "applications based." However, Dartmouth's embrace of courses
combining math and the humanities appears to be the most advanced and
wholehearted, and education experts said its approach is likely to
spread.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Workshops at Dartmouth have attracted faculty from colleges and
universities from the Midwest and East Coast. Although Trout reported
that the idea got a skeptical reception from some of the audience, at
least nine professors at other schools have begun using the approach in
their classes. As books, classroom videos, and other materials are
produced as part of the Math Across the Curriculum project, the approach
is expected to spread.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Introducing students to the world of math through an existing interest
in the humanities worked for the six students who took "Pattern." Five
have graduated, and all say they have gained a new appreciation for
math.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
"I don't understand why these connections aren't made earlier on,"
said graduate Mamie Lawrence. "I think it's a disservice when people
graduate and think of math as this subject and not as everyday life."
