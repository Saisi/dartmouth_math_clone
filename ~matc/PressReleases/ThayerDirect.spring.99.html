<FONT FACE=ARIAL>Thirty-eight Dartmouth 
freshmen are working check to jowl in Thayer School's microelectronics
lab. Students have in hand "chips" they created the previous week by
using photolithography to transfer one or more "mystery" devices onto 2"
x 2" chrome-covered glass slides. Some patterns are electrical devices,
some optical, but just what function any device might serve -- that's the
mystery. Students have had a week to ponder.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Tonight the task is to use lab test equipment -- an alpha-step
profilometer, for example, or a thermoelectric Peltier cooler -- to try out
ideas and see whether functions that seem possible might actually work.
Chris Levey, assistant professor of engineering 
who designed the lab, gives a brief overview of the equipment
available and reminds students to refer to the mini-manuals that are
part of their lab handout. Students go to work. Those who created
electrical devices solder wires onto their contact pads to make better
contact with the multimeter probes. Those who chose the optics route
shine laser beams through their chips and measure aspects of the
diffracted pattern thrown onto the wall. By 10 p.m., after the last
computer is shut down, they have figured out potential applications for
their chips -- from interdigitated electrode patterns used to sense dew
points to a chirped optical grating that can function as a cylindrical
lens. Some have sketched design changes for improvement.

<P ALIGN="left">
<FONT FACE=ARIAL>
Although a majority of the 38 students are heading toward engineering majors, 
this lab is not attached to an engineering course. They are
in the final weeks of Dartmouth's <A HREF="../IMPS/IMPSpage.html">
Integrated Mathematics and Physics sequence (IMPS)</A>, 
an experimental two-term course that synchronizes
topics in mathematics and physics so that each area of study supports
the other.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Typically, although calculus instructors may select examples from
physical science to illustrate techniques, and physics professors
demonstrate mathematical models for natural phenomena, the actual order
of topics for each course is determined without regard for the other. 
To a student, the cross-referencing may seem random. Even students with
strong skills in mathematics and science can be hard put to effectively
integrate what they know. Topics and techniques learned separately seem
to be stored separately. Topics that are near duplicates of each other
may be, in the student's
<!--p13-->
mind, unrelated because they were learned without connectors.

<P ALIGN="left">
<FONT FACE=ARIAL>
IMPS, now in its third year, immerses students in mathematical concepts
at the same time they learn about areas of physics to which the
concepts can be applied. Both mathematics and physics syllabi have been
reordered to synchronize physical phenomena and the mathematical models
needed to describe and interpret them.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The course is definitely challenging. Students hit the ground running
with first-order differential equations -- a topic not normally studied
until the fourth term of the traditional calculus sequence. Why jump
into differential equations? Because the first physics topic is an
experimental approach to falling objects and, while you can make
algebraic representations of experimental data, a thorough discussion
requires the elegance and accuracy of differential equations.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
IMPS students don't take Isaac Newton for granted. They drop objects,
measure time and distance, and fit their empirical data to mathematical
representations. They also study a variety of differential equations
that are generalized from similar data, including different graphical
representations such as direction fields or phase plane plots. By the
end of their introduction to falling objects, IMPS students can pop a
ping pong ball into the air and write an equation that represents the
ball's motion very precisely, taking into account not just acceleration
and the pull of gravity, but also the ball's mass and the electrical
charge that propels it upward. Sure, an algebraic model could
approximate the motion, but why not use mathematics the way physicists
do? As the IMPS textbook states, "You need to be able to look at a
physical problem and find a mathematical representation of that problem,
and then yon
need to be able to look at a mathematical result and see what it says
about the original physical problem." <FONT SIZE="-1">[Mook, D.E. and M. Groszek:

</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Other first-term topics pair vector-valued functions with
three-dimensional motion and second-order differential equations with
harmonic motion. Winter-term topics include multivariable calculus
applied to electricity and electromagnetism, and wave equations modeling
optics. Throughout the course, students regularly tackle open-ended
problems, problems for which neither the solution nor the appropriate
method is readily apparent.

</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Under the umbrella of the NSF-sponsored 
<A HREF="../index.html">Math Across the Curriculum project (MATC)</A>, 
IMPS has been developed jointly by faculty from
mathematics, physical sciences, and engineering. In its first two
<!--p14-->
years, it was a three-term course that included chemistry along with
mathematics and physics. Students and professors agreed that the 
three-way coordination was difficult and the interfaces sometimes unclear, 
so this year the course is a two-term mathematics-physics sequence.
Professors sit in on each others' classes to make sure the mesh is
seamless. IMPS faculty know they are in for a greater time commitment
than for other courses, but they value the interaction and getting to
know how each discipline uses the tools of the other.

<I>In the IMPS microengineering lab, students use techniques borrowed 
from the microelectronics industry to etch micropatterns in chrome 
and glass. Erin Morse D'02 is using a laser pointer to examine the 
diffraction pattern produced by her "IMPS chip." As a WISP intern 
working with Professor Chris Levey, Erin was also involved in the 
design of this device; the etch pattern she specified is the 
two-dimensional Fourier transform of the desired bullseye diffraction 
pattern shown here. Looks like another engineer is on her way!</I>

<P ALIGN="left">
When IMPS got under way, there was no plan for a textbook. During the
first year, students used standard texts supplemented by a
guide for coordinating nomenclature. Difficulties arose as students
jumped around in texts designed for linearity. Even with the translation
guide, language differences from one discipline to another were often
real obstacles to comprehension.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Starting last year, faculty began developing units and placing them on
<A HREF="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~imps/index.html">the IMPS Internet site</A>. This year those units, authored by Delo Mook,
professor of physics, and Marcia Groszek, professor of mathematics, have
jelled into an electronic textbook complete with animations. Although
the units are not yet ready for wider dissemination and cannot be viewed
by anyone outside the Dartmouth computer network, negotiations are
underway with publishers. The hope is that the units will eventually be
available in a flexible printed format with cross-references to the
Internet version.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Textbook and course follow the current trend in mathematics and science
education that "less is more." Rather than "covering" all topics in
physics and calculus, the focus is on thorough explorations of selected
concepts and techniques. Some traditionally "fundamental" topics don't
appear at all while others are treated more than once. IMPS faculty
believe that "seeing the same thing in a different way can often make
the difference between understanding a topic and not understanding it."

<!--p15-->
confident that students who have a thorough understanding of what IMPS
does cover will be able to consult other textbooks to learn topics

<I>Professor Chris Levey (left) is an enthusuastic advocate for the IMPS 
program. In 1996, at the very beginning of the program, he and Professor 
Ursi Gibson initiated a set of three labs for IMPS in the microengineering 
clean room.</I>

</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<FONT FACE=ARIAL>
This task of building relationships among topics and tackling complex
multi-step problems takes place in a supportive environment. The physics
department has dedicated the lab at 219 Wilder Hall to IMPS, and
students use it as a combination lounge, study hall, and laboratory.
Weekly tutorials provide assistance for anyone with homework
difficulties, and TAs from both disciplines are available at almost any
hour.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Eric Hansen, associate professor of engineering and co-investigator for
the MATC project, points to the camaraderie that develops among IMPS
students. "It's like being on a sports team," he says. "During their
first two terms at Dartmouth, they
spend at least two-thirds of their time going to classes, working on lab
problems, and doing homework together." Marcia Groszek adds, "They get
to know each other very well. They learn to work together in a way
other students don't."
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Indeed, friendships formed during the IMPS marathon often carry through
the students' remaining years at Dartmouth. IMPS graduates who find
themselves in the same classes continue their group study habits; some
even end up rooming together. "It's one of the best parts of IMPS," says
Dominic Germana D'O1, who took IMPS last year and is now an engineering
major. "It was good to have integrated math and science and all, but the
bonding of the class has been really great as far as developing a
support group for future engineering classes."
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Students enter IMPS from diverse backgrounds. Although enrollees must be
familiar with elementary calculus, there is no physics
prerequisite. The current crop of IMPS students range from some with
Advanced Placement physics credit to a few who come from small schools
where the physics lab is held together with duct tape. According to
Allison Miller, physics TA for the course, you can't tell a student's
background from the grade sheet. "They help each other," she says.
Working together in informal study groups, students share both expertise
and problems.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Miller also points to the supportive environment for women students. "It's
a course that shatters stereotypes," she says. "It's good for students
to work with women faculty members (three of the four instructors this
year are women) and use a textbook that is co-authored by a woman."

<FONT COLOR="#996633"><B>FROM PRE-ENGINEERING TO ENGINEERING</B></FONT>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Dartmouth is not the only undergraduate school experimenting with
<!--p16-->
an integrated curriculum. In Indiana, Rose-Hulman Institute of
Technology is part of a movement among engineering schools to integrate
first-year mathematics, science, and engineering courses. That school
has been joined in the restructuring effort by a coalition including
Arizona State University, Texas A &amp; M, and the University of Alabama,
among others.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
What are the outcomes of these experiments in integration? At Dartmouth,
IMPS has a good record for retaining engineering majors. Last year, the
17 IMPS students who began the year leaning toward engineering all
continued into the major and were, in fact, joined by five others who
had come in undecided. "This increase is very important," says Dorothy
Wallace, professor of mathematics and principal investigator for MATC.
"One of the primary purposes of developing the course was to increase
the number of engineering majors. In that it has been very successful."
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Wallace acknowledges that the results of standardized tests or rankings
of IMPS graduates by professors in later courses do not show a
significant difference between IMPS students and those who take
traditional mathematics and physics; she also points out that these
statistics may be less meaningful in light of the fact that potential
engineering majors often fall by the wayside in the traditional courses
while those taking IMPS are more likely to go on, even if they find
themselves in the bottom half of the class.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Students can be emphatic about the advantages of IMPS. Dean Rahman 
D'O1, who took IMPS last year
and is now an engineering major, says that he found himself this year
tutoring students who took the traditional track. "I can tell you that
the fluidity and continuity the IMPS sequence provided -- and the other
courses lacked -- was invaluable. Also the integration of math, physics,
and chemistry solidified my understanding of concepts so that my
learning efficiency multiplied." Angel Guarniz D'01, also an engineering
major, is enthusiastic about how the mathematics was more than numbers.
"With the real-life
problems given to us," he says, "it took on a whole new meaning." Even
Susan Ashlock D'OO, who took the course in its first rough-edged year
and says frankly that it was frustrating being a "guinea pig," is quick 
to balance the frustrations with her easy transition into engineering 
courses. Describe circuitry using differential equations? No problem 
after IMPS.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
<FONT COLOR="#996633"><B>WHAT'S AHEAD FOR IMPS</B></FONT>
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
The NSF grant for MATC runs through next year, so IMPS has one more year
to prove its value in the Dartmouth curriculum. With only 40 or so
students, it doesn't offer real load relief for either the mathematics
or the physics department. Faculty from both are supportive of its
continuation as are Thayer
School professors who see it as the preferred entry for engineering
students. As more students pass through and talk about the confidence
gained from working in teams and the value of strong relationships with
fellow students and professors, word-of-mouth student marketing plus the
strong support of Thayer School faculty will hopefully lead to an
increase in enrollment and clear sustainability.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Whether or not the actual IMPS course remains in the Dartmouth
curriculum after 2001, it's a sure bet
its influence will continue. Professors who have worked together
developing courses and a textbook have opened a window for dialogue.
They've taken the extra time to sit in on each other's classes, they've
learned how the concepts and techniques of each discipline can mesh into
a whole. The window is not going to close. Future Dartmouth students -- and
students from other schools who pick up the IMPS textbook -- will continue
to discover some very dynamic connections between calculus, physics, and
engineering.
