At the front of the room the art professor is demonstrating techniques
of block printing to a dozen students. On the board is a diagram of a
graph of subgroups drawn by the students, indicating which of the
seventeen wallpaper groups are contained in each other. The students are
getting ready for their fourth assignment: printing a series of three
block prints, each of which displays a symmetry group containing that of
the previous one. The finished prints will take hours of work, require
mathematical precision, and dazzle the eye.

A room of thirty premedical students watches as the professor connects
some flexible plastic tubes to an apparatus. This class has been
developing a model for changes in blood pressure due to constricting
arteries. In addition to actual medical data, they are using this
apparatus to test their model. Later, students will say this class
"opened their eyes" to the fact that math is "more than just taking a
derivative" and has many applications in real life.

Forty first year students are gathered in groups of three or four to
work out a problem in vector calculus as both their math professor and
their physics professor look on. They know that the physics they learned
yesterday ought to inform the problem they are working on right now, and
that the math they are studying today is likely to be used in tomorrow's
physics class. They help each other master the material they know they
will need. More of these students will be inclined to major in
engineering by the end of their two quarters of intensive
interdisciplinary study than when the class began, making the course a
recruiting force for engineering.

A mathematics professor is explaining the basis of relativity theory to
a lecture hall of a hundred and sixty liberal arts students, who sit
quietly taking notes. The silence is broken by the professor of
comparative literature, who demands to know why the students do not
question the information they are receiving. "Do you believe him? This
would never stand in one of my classes! If I said something
incomprehensible, students would be all over me until I explained myself
thoroughly. Why do you accept this from a scientist?" Discussion breaks
out about the information we take at face value, the authority of the
"expert" and the role of critical thinking as it pertains to science and
mathematics.

"Pattern, Applications of Calculus in Medicine and Biology," "Integrated
Mathematics and Physical Science," and "A Matter of Time" are just a few
of the 26 courses developed or enhanced at Dartmouth College as part of
the Mathematics Across the Curriculum project funded by the National
Science Foundation in 1995. In addition to courses, this project
sponsored the development of many materials, including an
interdisciplinary text in math and physics, parts of a text on the math
and biology of Lake Victoria, (intended to address the diversity of
students taking math), several new modules in statistics and data
analysis, and a collection of course readers in mathematics and
humanities. All of these materials make interdisciplinary teaching of
math more accessible to a national audience.

By 1998, the MATC project had benefited over 2,000 students at
Dartmouth, directly involved 178 faculty at Dartmouth and collaborating
institutions, created 78 modules, books and videos, and sponsored or
cosponsored five workshops serving faculty in mathematics, literature,
history, philosophy, art, art history, biology, geology, and
engineering. Other institutions interested in such interdisciplinary
activities might find the course syllabi and materials at (http://
www.dartmouth.edu/-matc/) a useful feature.

While the cries for increased numeracy of the undergraduate population
have fed the development of mandatory general education courses in
"quantitative literacy" throughout the country, Dartmouth has taken a
different and more difficult road, with the creation of a broad swath of
courses designed to attract rather than conscript students into
mathematics. This alternate path stems from a lengthy discussion of the
goals of a liberal arts education. One of the best descriptions of these
goals is due to Gerald Holton, historian of science, who twenty-five
years ago made his case in an essay on the teaching of physics:
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
"Here I must explain in more detail just why I believe it to be wrong to
force a nonscience student to take, as is often done to "fulfill a
science requirement," simply the regular introductory specialty course
given by a science department. I start from a general belief that the
total orienting process of a young student in college, it seems to me,
has at least five goals.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
"If he or she is to emerge as an educated and sane person from our
educational institutions, the student should be well on the road to
recognizing which are his own talents, whatever they may be; second, he
should know enough about his physical home, this universe, not to feel
either overwhelmed by it or a total stranger in it; third, he should
know how to be in fruitful relationship with his fellow men; fourth he
should know what the past means and what the probable future may be; and
fifth, he should know the difference between, and the relative functions
of, his mind and his soul." ("Physics and Culture, Criteria for
Curriculum Design", Thematic Origins of Scientific Thought, Harvard
University Press, 1973).

Holton's vision of what an interdisciplinary physics course could be
offers a model which Dartmouth independently pursued with respect to
mathematics. The process of delineating their goals and designing their
courses created consensus and camaraderie among faculty. The courses
themselves fostered a new attitude toward mathematics among the students
taking them. Clearly a large variety of courses would have different
kinds of impact on students, some resulting in measurable differences in
mastery of the mathematics, some improving retention in science majors,
some affecting the attitudes of the students toward mathematics.
Independent evaluators studied the impact of the Dartmouth courses on
Students through subject tests, surveys and interviews with individual
students. Three results stand out across all the curriculum
interventions as potential guideposts to future development in any
mathematics curriculum:
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Students' interest in mathematics is more important than their perceived
math ability in determining whether they study more mathematics. Many
students who view themselves as able mathematicians forego college
mathematics because they see no career utility or intellectual reward.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Real-life applications make mathematics more approachable and more
interesting. Whether students' interests are pre-med, pre-engineering or
pre-history, connecting mathematics to their existing interests
transforms math from a "cut and dried" requirement to a relevant tool
for advancing their learning.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
Expanding the range of mathematics topics accessible to average college
students increases their interest in mathematics. To most entering
college students, calculus is upper level math. As a result, many who do
not need calculus in their careers turn away from college math
altogether. Students were excited by courses that offered non-calculus
topics (combinatorics, number theory, group theory, probability, etc.),
revealing unsuspected new worlds of mathematics to discover and enjoy.
</P>

<P ALIGN="left">
For many students, these courses have been a source of great insight
into the doing of science and math. As one of the future engineers in
the Integrated Mathematics and Physical Science sequence put it: "Math
and science are scary and messy and wonderful and exciting. It's no
longer about right and wrong answers; there are so many more things to
think about. IMPS math and science isn't cameo, homogenized topics; it's
the real thing at times-headaches and all."
