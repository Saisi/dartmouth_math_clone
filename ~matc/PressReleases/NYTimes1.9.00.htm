<strong>HEADLINE:</strong> BLACKBOARD: CURRICULUM;
<br>Nietzsche and Math, Together Again

<strong>BODY:</strong>
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;In the latest effort to convert the mathematically
squeamish, 
<strong>Dartmouth</strong> College has developed a new program, 
&quot;Math Across the Curriculum,&quot; that integrates the subject into some
very unlikely places -- art and 
literature, for example.
<br><br>&quot;A Matter of Time&quot; pairs a comparative literature professor
and a math professor to lead 
discussions on the fourth dimension. Readings include 
&quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the Book
of Genesis and works by Freud, Nietzsche, 
Poe and Borges.  

<br><br> 
&quot;Pattern&quot; explores elementary group theory and its applications to
art, ranging from 
mandalas to Escher to Islamic tiles. For die-hards, 
&quot;Integrated Mathematics and Physical Sciences&quot; combines math, science
and physics.
<br><br>The program, which is financed by the National Science Foundation, 
&quot;presents math in the most integrated fashion, using students' interests
as the 
hook,&quot; explained Dr. Jane Korey, an anthropologist and consultant on the
project. 
&quot;We all learn better if we can attach ideas to something we already know,
so if 
you're a strong literature person and the math you use has to do with 
literature, you can bootstrap your way up.&quot;
<br><br>She added: 
&quot;It shows students that math is relevant to their lives and will be useful
to 
their futures. Math is a whole way of looking at the
world.&quot;&#160;&#160;&#160;ABBY ELLIN
