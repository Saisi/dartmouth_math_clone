<p>Homework due Oct. 25: see <b><a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/m105-1-f12.pdf">this</a></b>.
(Note, a small edit was added to this at 2:30 pm on Oct. 23.)

<p>Some notes of Florian Luca:<br>

<p>Some notes of Michael Filaseta:<br>

(Parts of these course notes are fleshed out versions of arguments in

</p>


<p>Check out the article "Solving the Pell equation" by H. W. Lenstra, jr,
in <i>Notices Amer. Math. Soc.</i> <b>49</b> (2002), 182-192.<br>
I could see several student class presentations based on this article...
</p>

<p>We will start out using the text <br>
Lecture Notes on Diophantine Analysis, by Umberto Zannier (Publications of the Scuola Normale Superiore / Lecture Notes (Scuola Normale Superiore)) [Paperback].<br>
See a short list of errata <b><a href="https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/zannier-errata.pdf">here.</a></b><br>
This book has <b>not</b> been ordered locally; it can be purchased at amazon.com
and other online sellers.  It can be bought fairly cheaply as far as textbooks go.
</p>

<p> We meet Tuesday, Thursday 10:00 AM to 11:50 AM in 108 Kemeny.
</p>
<p> Assignment 3, due Tuesday, Oct. 16:
<br>
From the book, exercises 2.22 - 2.27.
</p>
<p> Assignment 2, due Thursday, Oct. 4: <br>
From the book, excercises 2.1, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6.
</p>

<p> Assignment 1, due Thursday, Sept. 20.<br>
From the book, do exercises 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, and two of 1.7 to 1.10 (your choice).
<br>
Extra problems:<br>
(1) Suppose m, n are integers that are not squares.  Show that
m<sup>1/2</sup>+n<sup>1/2</sup> is irrational.<br>
(2) Show that 2<sup>1/2</sup>+3<sup>1/3</sup> is irrational.  Generalize
this as far as you can.

Introduction to Diophantine equations and Diophantine approximation:<br>
<p>
The subject of Diophantine equations
involves determining if a polynomial equation in several variables has any
integer or rational solutions, and if it does, how to find them. Diophantine approximation
refers to the approximation of real numbers with rational numbers. We shall see
that the two topics are closely intertwined.  Some of the more specific topics will
be the Pell equation (quadratic in two variables) and the Thue equation (a homogeneous
polynomial in two variables equal to a constant).  We shall see how to prove that <i>e</i> and
<i>&pi;</i> are transcendental numbers, and we'll discuss some other pretty constants.

<p>
We will start out using the book "Lecture notes on Diophantine analysis" by Umberto Zannier.
This book is available from amazon.com for about $30 including shipping, but I'm not sure
how robust the supply is.  It would be good to order a copy soon. Partway into the term
we'll branch out using some other material, which I'll make available.

<p>
There will be some written homework assignments, and students will be expected to occasionally
present topics to the class, possibly a homework solution or a new topic.  There will be no formal
examinations.  As far as prerequisites go, it would be good for students taking this class to
know elementary number theory and some abstract algebra.  Grading will be based on written
assignments and in-class presentations (though grad students admitted to candidacy
will not have their grades based on written assignments).

Grades will be based on homework, class participation, and oral

dissertations will not be judged on written homework, but they may
hand it in if they like, especially if they are particularly proud
of some solution.)

		  <td>

			<p style="text-align : justify"> Collaboration on
homework is definitely allowed and even encouraged.  However,
it is tempting to think that you understand something that was figured out
by your friend.  When you hand in a solution, you should know it well enough
that you could explain it to others.  Please name others you worked with
when handing in homework papers.  If a solution is found in a book or on-line, then make
it your own (i.e., rewrite it in your own words) and give a citation.  It is 
better though to try and work things out yourself and so build your confidence!              
Merely copying (electronic or
			otherwise) of another person's solutions, in whole
			or in part, is a violation of the Honor Code.</p>
