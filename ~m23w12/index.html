<center><h1>Math 23 Winter 2012<br /> Differential Equations</h1></center>


Differential equations relate a function to some expression involving its derivatives or partial derivatives.  Any quantity that obeys rules involving its various rates of change can be modeled with these equations.  These kinds of equations therefore occur throughout the sciences, engineering, economics and medicine.

</center>

<p>Note that you do not need an appointment to attend regularly-scheduled office hours.  If you have a conflict you may make an appointment to meet outside those times.</p>

<p><b>Textbook:</b> <a href= "http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP000254.html">Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems</a> by Boyce and DiPrima. 9th edition.  Homework will be assigned from the text.  We will also make use of <a href= "../~matc/eBookshelf/calculus/BigGreen.html">The Big Green Ordinary Differential Equation Machine</a> to assist with numerical solutions.  Those who know Matlab are encouraged to use it. There will also be a few research papers to read.
</p>

<p><b>Students with disabilities</b> enrolled in this course and who may need disability-related classroom accommodations are encouraged to see their instructor privately as early as possible in the term. Students requiring disability-related accommodations must register with the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~accessibility/">Student Accessibility Service</a> office. Once SAS has authorized accommodations, students must show the originally signed SAS Accommodations/Consent Form and/or a letter on SAS letterhead to their professor. As a first step, if students have questions about whether they qualify to receive accommodations, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions about accommodations will remain confidential.</p>

<p>For your convenience, here is the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/calendars/term/2011-09.html">term calendar</a> as set by the registrar, with deadlines for schedule adjustment and other significant dates.</p>


<h2>The Honor Principle</h2>

<p><b>On Exams</b>: No assistance may be given or received except that you may ask the instructor for clarification of a problem.  In particular, no calculators or computing devices may be used.</p>

<p><b>On Homework</b>: Collaboration and discussion is encouraged, and you may discuss problems with instructors, tutors, and fellow students, and use notes, books, calculators, and computing devices.  However, each student is to complete his or her assignments individually and independently.</p>

<p><b>On Term paper:</b> discussion with others encouraged and paper to be written in pairs.  You and your partner must write it yourself with proper citations.  We encourage you to consult with a writing editor (the College provides these through its writing programs).  </p>


<h2>Lectures and Exams</h2>

<p>Lectures will be held Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, with x-hour used only if needed to replace a class.</p>

<center><b>If you have a conflict with a scheduled exam contact your instructor as soon as possible.</b></center>

<h2>Homework and Tutorials</h2>

<p><b>Homework</b> is due in the boxes outside of 008 Kemeny Hall by 5pm on Monday (unless it is a holiday, then it is due Tuesday).  
Homework will be returned to the boxes on Friday around 5pm.  </p>


<p><b>Tutorials</b> are an additional resource for you to get help with the course.  Similarly to office hours, they are times set aside for you to come for assistance with material.  We have one teaching assistant, Dan Cianci.</p>
